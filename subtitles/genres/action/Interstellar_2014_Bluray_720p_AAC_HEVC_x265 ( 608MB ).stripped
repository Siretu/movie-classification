Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.
<font color="#808080">HANLEY :</font>
Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.
But she's been having a little trouble lately.
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.
Corrected?
Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked
to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> You don't believe we went to the moon?
It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.
The Soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources...
...into rockets and other useless machines.
"Useless machines."
If we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...
...we need to teach our kids about this planet,
not tales of leaving it.
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.
If we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...
...which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...
...the calmer one.
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates over this...
...Apollo nonsense.
So we thought it best
to bring you in and see what ideas...
...you might have for dealing
with her behavior on the home front.
Yeah, you know what?
Um, there's a game tomorrow night.
She's going through a bit of a baseball phase.

- Who's "they"?
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> How long would I be gone?
<font color="#808080">PROF. BRAND :</font> Hard to know. Years?
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> I've got kids, professor.
<font color="#808080">PROF. BRAND :</font> Get out there and save them.
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> Who's "they"?
<font color="#808080">ROMILLY :</font> We started detecting gravitational anomalies
almost 50 years ago.
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> Yeah, over the Straights.
My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.
<font color="#808080">ROMILLY :</font> Exactly.
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:
Out near Saturn...
...a disturbance of space-time.
- Is that a Wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> And it leads where?
<font color="#808080">PROF. BRAND :</font> Another galaxy.
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.
<font color="#808080">AMELIA :</font> Someone placed it there.
-"They"?
- Mm.
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.
That Wormhole lets us travel to other stars.
It came along right as we needed it.
<font color="#808080">DOYLE :</font> They've put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.
Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.
- You sent probes into that?
- Mm-hm.
<font color="#808080">PROF. BRAND :</font> We sent people into it. Ten years ago.
The Lazarus missions.
<font color="#808080">PROF. BRAND :</font>
Twelve possible worlds...
...twelve Ranger launches carrying...
...the bravest humans ever to live...
...led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
<font color="#808080">DOYLE :</font> Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...
...then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.
And what if the world didn't show promise?
Hence the bravery.
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.
No.
Data transmission back through
the Wormhole is rudimentary.
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.
And one system shows promise.
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?
<font color="#808080">AMELIA :</font> One system with three potential worlds?
No long shot.
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> Okay.
So if we find a home...
...then what?
- That's the long shot.
<font color="#808080">PROF. BRAND :</font> There's a Plan A and a Plan B.
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font>
This entire facility's a centrifuge.
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?
<font color="#808080">PROF. BRAND :</font>
Both. Plan A.
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> How do you get it off the ground?
<font color="#808080">PROF. BRAND :</font> The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.
But you haven't solved it yet.
<font color="#808080">AMELIA :</font> That's why there's Plan B.
The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet.
This is one way.
Plan B: a population bomb.
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.
How would you raise them?
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.
This takes care of that.
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> But what about the people here? You just...
...give up on them?
My kids?
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.
You're asking me to hang everything...
...on an almost.
I'm asking you to trust me.
<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font>
Find us a new home.
And by the time you return...
...I will have solved the problem of gravity.
I give you my word.

No, that does not make it wrong.
It might.

Well, next year ain't gonna save us,

<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.
Tom will be all right,
but you got to make things right with Murph.
I Will.
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.
You have to talk to me, Murph.
I need to fix this before I go.
<font color="#808080">MURPH :</font>
Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay.
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.
She said, "Now...
...we're just here
to be memories for our kids."
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.
<font color="#808080">MURPH :</font> You said ghosts didn't exist.
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> That's right, Murph.
Murph, look at me.
I can't be your ghost right now.
I need to exist.
They chose me.
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.
<font color="#808080">MURPH :</font> That's exactly why you can't go.
I figured out the message.
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.
"Stay."
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.
You don't believe me.
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."
Why...? You're not listening! It says, "Stay!"
No, I'm coming back.
<i>When'?</i>
One for you, one for me.
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...
...traveling near the speed of light, or...
...near a black hole...
...time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.
When we get back...
...we're gonna compare.
<font color="#808080">MURPH :</font> Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.
"What?" Imagine that!
Aw, Murph...
You have no idea when you're coming back.
No idea at all!
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> Murph, don't... Don't make me leave like this.
Come on, Murph!
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

Forever. You hear me?
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.
I'm coming back.

Just fine.
I love you, Tom.

They're both promising.
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann

We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds's data would have soured.
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

- Cooper, this is my field.
And...

is the better prospect.
- Why?
-Gargantua, that's why.
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...
...but no life. Sterile.
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
Because of the black hole?
Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.
Accident is the first building block
of evolution.
But when you're orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.
It sucks in asteroids and comets,
other events which would otherwise reach you.
We need to go further afield.
You once said that Dr. Mann...
...was the best of us.
He's remarkable.
We're only here because of him.
And yet... Yet here he is.
He's on the ground, and he's sending
a very unambiguous message, telling us...

So listen to me...
...when I say that love

...observable, powerful.
It has to mean something.
Love has meaning, yes.
Social utility, social bonding, child rearing...
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?
None.
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...
...yet understand.
Maybe it's some evidence, some...
...artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.
I'm drawn across the universe
to someone I haven't seen in a decade...
...who I know is probably dead.
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving...
...that transcends dimensions
of time and space.
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

All right.
Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites.
One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.
Once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.
I can take you to the probe sites,

Did it work?
<i><font color="#808080">TARS :</font>
I think it might have.</i>
How do you know?
<i>Because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.</i>
Don't you get it yet, TARS?
They're not "Beings."
They're us.
What I've been doing for Murph,
they're doing for me.
For all of us.
<i>Cooper, people couldn't build this.</i>
No. No, not yet.
But one day.
Not you and me. But people.
A civilization that's evolved past
the four dimensions we know.

Mr. Cooper.
All right. Let's take it slow, sir.
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Actually, you are 124 years old.
<font color="#D900D9">(CHEERING OUTSIDE)</font>
Take it slow, sir.
You were, uh, extremely lucky.
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> Where am I?
Cooper Station.
Currently orbiting Saturn.
Cooper Station.
Nice of you to name it after me.
<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHS)</font>
What?
The station isn't named after you, sir.
It's, uh, named after your daughter.
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.
Is she still alive'?
She'll be here in a couple weeks.
She is far too old to be transferring
from another station...
...but when she heard
that you'd been found...
...well, this is, uh, Murphy Cooper
we're talking about.
Yes, it is.
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple days.
I'm sure you'll be excited to see
what's in store.
I actually, uh, did a paper on you
in high school.
I know all about your life back on Earth.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
If... If you'll follow me,
we've got a really good situation for you.
So, uh, when I made my suggestion
to Miss Cooper...
...l was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect.
<i>WO<font color="#808080">MAN #1 :</font> <font color="#D900D9">(ON TV)</font> It was just constant.
Just that steady blow of dirt.</i>
Of course, I didn't speak to her personally.
<i><font color="#808080">MAN #1 :</font>
We always set the plate upside-down.</i>
<i>Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down.</i>
<i>Well, my dad was a farmer.
Uh, like everybody else back then.</i>
<i>There just wasn't enough food.</i>
<i><font color="#808080">WOMAN #2 :</font>
We wore little things, little strips...</i>
<i>...of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.</i>
<i>Well, it was pretty exciting for me
because it was hope.</i>
<i><font color="#808080">MAN #2 :</font> I don't care who describes it, there is
no way for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad.</i>
<font color="#808080">MAN :</font> She did confirm
just how much you loved farming.
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah.
Come here.
Home sweet home.

I don't care much for this pretending
we're back where we started.
I want to know where we are.
<i>Where we're going.</i>
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
-Yeah.
Family?
Yeah, they all came out to see her.
She's been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> It was me, Murph.
I was your ghost.
<font color="#808080">MURPH :</font> I know.
People didn't believe me.
They thought that I was doing it all myself.
But...
...I knew who it was.
Nobody believed me.
But I knew you'd come back.
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> How?
<font color="#808080">MURPH :</font> Because my dad promised me.
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> Well, I'm here now, Murph.
I'm here.

No parent should have to watch

You go.
