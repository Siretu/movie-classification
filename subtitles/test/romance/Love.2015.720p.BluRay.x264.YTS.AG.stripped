Nora?
Dad.
What hours will?
What did I do last night?
Why did I take that shit?
Why you are complaining about?
Today, it's shit.
The whole year is going to be like this.
I'm still hard.
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Murphy.
Happy New Year!
I should have brushed my teeth.
I smell like shit.
He thinks his father is disgusting.
But I'm not.
Who is that?
Who is that?
- Who's that there?
- Mom.
Why are you calling me
Electra's mother?
Oh, my God!
This is a nightmare.
I shouldn't exist right now.
The place is a cage.
So early.
It seems strange that you're calling now.
Not a good sign.
Hello. This is Electra's mother.
Sorry to bother on the first of January,
but I haven't had news from my
daughter for the last two months...
- Baby, do you want some tea or coffee?
- Shit, this is not good.
Sounds like bad news.
Seems so long ago.
Seems like another lifetime.
Two years.
I miss her.
I miss her so much.
I wish she was here right now.
Hello.
- Nora.
- Yes? Who is it?
Who is it?
It is Murphy.
How are you?
What do you want?
I've been trying to get a hold of...
Electra and I have been
calling her and...
She hasn't answered
And I was wondering...
Maybe she got a new phone?
I won't tell you.
- It's...
- You should be ashamed.
- Listen...
- You destroyed everything.
Can you please ...?
You destroyed my daughter.
My only daughter.
Could you please
give me her number...
so I can speak with her.
Anyway, I can just...
What do you think? You're just garbage...
Listen, you don't understand
I love your daughter very much.
- Really?
- It is very important that I talk to her.
Leave us alone. Go to hell!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello. This is Electra's mother.
Sorry to bother you on the
first of January, but...
I haven't had news from my daughter,
for the last two months.
I'm worried.
And I know she was in a suicidal mood.
If you can call me...
it would be nice.
I am very, very worried.
Thank you.
Hello.
I should just shut up.
Always hungry.
Dad!
Thank you.
You've gotten a little bit fat, huh?
- Yes, I'm fat.
- Aren't you?
My dick is fat.
She is so bitter sometimes.
I think Daddy is pregnant.
There's nothing here for me.
Except for this little guy.
I hope she won't turn him gay.
You know how babies like you
come to this world?
What happened?
It broke.
And did you come?
Murphy.
I need to tell you something.
I think I'm pregnant.
I took a pregnancy test today.
And it was positive.
Do you want to see it?
Two strikes means positive.
Can we do another one?
Yes, sure.
Who was that on the phone?
I can't lie to her.
She was the mother of an old friend.
- Are you sure?
- Maybe I should tell her.
Sometimes it's better not to lie.
I'm sick of this bitch.
Go take care of the baby and
leave me alone. Please.
She tricked me. I know she did.
Living with a woman is like
sharing a bed with the CIA.
Nothing is secret.
This used to be my apartment.
I used to be happy here.
It doesn't feel
like my place anymore.
I'm always looking
over my shoulder now.
My last secret corner.
My last private space.
The only thing left of my life.
I remember when she gave me this.
Let's try to protect...
Protect each other.
Opium.
- Do you want to take it now?
- No.
Keep it for...
if something bad happens in
your life and I'm not there.
It will protect you.
It's okay?
What's wrong?
Omi is pregnant.
What?
Omi is pregnant?
Awful.
Of who?
She is dancing over there, man.
Do you see her?
I don't give a fuck.
Let it go, okay?
- It's done.
- You're done with her.
It's fine.
- Who is she dancing with?
- Who cares?
Who cares?
What are you talking about?
Who gives a fuck.
Let it go, alright?
Electra.
Relax bro.
Electra, I want to talk to you.
I want to talk to you.
- It's okay. Relax.
- Don't touch.
- Relax.
- I'm sorry.
Relax, relax, relax.
- Leave me alone!
- Go find someone else to dance.
Leave me alone. Aren't you
having fun with your family?
Hey, are you dancing with a
midget to piss me off or something?
No. I'm fucking having fun.
Are you?
- I need to talk to you.
- Hey hey.
- It doesn't matter.
- Don't touch her.
Who's touching? Who the fuck is that?
What do you want from me?
You're having a baby with a slut.
You think I wanted this to happen?
- I never wanted this to happen.
- Ask her to have an abortion.
- We made a promise together.
- Yes, and you failed.
- I belong with you.
- You are a loser.
You belong to me.
- You are a loser.
- I want to have a baby with you.
I love you!
- I love you.
- You don't know what love is.
Fuck off!
Hey!
Electra, you know who you are!
- You're fucking with me.
- No, I'm not fucking with you.
- I want to be alone.
- You see that?
No!
These are the words of a liar!
You're a damn fish parasite.
Killing me!
You're killing me. You're going to kill me.
I love so much.
- I hate you!
- I love so much.
- I hate you!
- I love you...
I'm the one who's hurting right now!
Electra, I love you!
Do you hear me? I love you!
I know you're listening to me!
Electra, I know you can hear this!
Answer me! Please!
Please!
Electra, open the door.
Electra, open the door.
Open the door, baby.
Please open the door, you fucking bitch.
Open the door, you selfish cunt!
Please open the door!
Electra, please.
No.
- Open the door.
- Go away!
Fuck.
Go away!
Piece of shit!
- Stop it please.
- Piece of shit!
Piece of shit!
Piece of shit!
- Piece of shit.
- I want you to forgive me.
You're a piece of shit!
You're a piece of shit.
Can you hear me?
- Piece of shit!
- I am going to kill you.
I am going to fucking kill you.
I know your fucking place.
I am going to fucking kill you.
- Hey Relax brother.
- No!
Get out.
- Are you a fucking junkie?
- Go away.
But what...?
No no!
No no!
No!
No.
No.
- Hey Julio.
- Yeah?
- What do you want?
- You piece of shit.
- Listen to me junkie fuck.
- Chill. Chill.
- Don't be jealous.
- Jealous of what?
- Jealous of what?
- Jealous of what?
- Yes. Jealous of what?
- You know what.
- No I don't.
- Let me tell you.
Tell me. Tell me. Jealous of what?
Fucking explain it to me.
- Are you fucking my girlfriend?
- I'm not fucking your girlfriend.
Are you fucking my girlfriend?
No. No man.
But she likes coke.
What can I say?
- She likes coke?
- Yeah.
- And you're doing well with it.
- You put her there, man.
You fucking put her there.
- I put her there?
- Yeah. You put her there.
Really? How does that work?
Explain that to me. Explain to me,
you, sick little fuck, little weasel.
Where the fuck is she?
Listen. That is what
she says all the time.
You gave her the first line.
Then you started
fucking all these girls.
Cheating on her.
So what's up, you know?
Be a man about it. Man up.
Stay away from her.
Don't be a pussy and start smashing her.
Wait a minute. What?
I don't even know what
to say to you right now.
You better pray to God that
we don't run into each other.
Okay, okay. You know what?
Just let it go. And just tell
your mom that you lost your friend...
and a friend or
lost your girlfriend.
Piece of shit. When I find you,
I'm gonna take your fucking balls
and shove them up your fucking ass.
And I'm going to get the
by the damn ass.
I'm gonna fuck you in the ass, so...
Fucking like your head explodes.
Hey, needle dick.
Shut the fuck up.
- Needle dick, really?
- Hey, listen. I gotta go.
I have to go.
I got some people to see.
Don't fucking hang up the phone.
Don't hang up the damn phone.
Listen to me, listen to me.
If you fucking touch my girlfriend...
If you fucking lay, one fucking
finger on her ever again,
I'll fucking rip your head off!
Okay. Peace, brother.
Have a good night.
Julio. Julio.
Don't hang up the phone, Julio.
I love you.
Me too.
Where are you going?
I am going out.
You haven't been here all day long.
Where were you?
Electra's mother called.
She hasn't heard from her,
three months.
- Oh, Electra.
- She is worried about her.
I think she might have hurt herself.
You know what? Take care of your past
and then I'll take care of the future.
She said we could
do anything together.
But there is one thing we never did.
We never made a baby.
No.
Can you show me ...?
How down you can be?
Have you ever tried...?
Sex on opium?
- No.
- It's great.
Very relaxed.
What is the best?
- Opium.
- Best sex?
Electra.
This is the only way
we can be close.
Having you inside me again.
Now you are inside.
I miss you.
Electra.
What is your ultimate fantasy?
- Sexwise?
- Sure.
Fuck with another girl, and you?
Fuck with another girl?
This is my dream too.
A blonde.
Pretty.
- A blonde?
- With blue eyes.
Do you like blonde girls?
Good morning.
Hello.
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, I speak English.
- Are you the new neighbor?
- Yeah, I just moved in.
- Cool.
- Yes.
Yes.
- I guess I'll see you around.
- Yes.
Goodbye.
Hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How are you?
- Good.
- Yes?
Do you wanna hang out later?
Yes. We can go eat something.
- Yes.
- Great.
Thank you. Thank you so
much for inviting me.
- Come on.
- It is nothing.
The pleasure is all ours.
- So, do you have a family here?
- No, I haven't.
- Where are your parents?
- I don't know.
I was an accident, so...
What do you mean?
Well, life. They did not want me...
Kind of.
She wanted... your mother
wanted to have an abortion?
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
She was like. Life and...
I never knew my dad, so yeah.
- Did you ever have an abortion?
- No.
That's good.
- Me neither.
- OK.
I'm glad to hear that.
- Dislike...
- Although...
Although I have to say
that I am pro-choice.
Really?
Yeah.
- Not you?
- I am in favor of life.
- You are pro-life?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Well, otherwise I wouldn't be here.
OK, so,
you are against abortion,
but you're cool with..
People killing
animals and eating them?
Yes, but tha, that's...
that's two different things.
You know, like, it's part
of nature to eat meat.
You come here, eat meat and make babies.
- Yes. Don't you agree?
- I guess so.
What about drugs?
You are pro-drugs?
- You like getting high?
- Well...
It is also very natural to smoke.
I think people have been smoking for
thousand years, million years.
As they found relief.
Do you want to smoke a
natural joint in our place?
- After this?
- Yes. I would love to.
You are a very sweet couple.
You're a very sweet neighbor.
How old are you?
17.
- 17?
- Yes.
Like, soon?
I fucking love you!
Give me that.
Hi, this is Nora's voice-mail.
You can leave a message
after the beep tone.
Please, Please denote that I will be...
out of Paris, until the 5th of January.
I wish you all a very happy New Year.
Bonne annee, A bientot.
Hey. This is Murphy.
I'm calling you back.
I haven't heard from
Electra in quite a while.
But I am just as worried as you are.
So...
maybe you could give me your
new number or I could...
call some of her old friends.
Call me when you get this. Please.
Bye.
I'm a loser.
Yeah. Just a dick.
And a dick has no brain.
A dick has only one purpose.
To fuck.
And I fucked it all up.
Yeah.
I'm good at one thing.
Fucking things up.
But she was hot.
I couldn't resist.
I had to get inside there.
Hi.
How are you?
- Good. And you?
- Yeah.
Cool.
Where is Electra?
She is not here this weekend.
Would you like to come over?
It broke.
I'm very stoned right now.
Electra, I wish you were here.
Doing opium me.
My body feels amazing.
And the rain is sweet.
Sweet.
Sweet.
If we had a baby,
What would you name it?
And you?
If it was a boy.
- Maybe Gaspar.
- Gaspar.
Yeah.
Gaspar.
Would you call Gaspar?
Yeah.
Gaspar.
I need to sit up.
I'm too stoned.
Oh, God! I miss her.
I need to see your face again.
When we were happy.
Yeah.
Love is strange.
I feel like a junkie.
How can something so wonderful?...
bring such great pain?
Perhaps it is better
to never love at all.
If you die.
I'll have these images to remember you by.
I don't want to die.
I'll cry.
Hello. This is Noe
International Art Gallery.
We are open from Tuesday to Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 7 p. m.
Please leave a
message after the tone.
And we'll call you back
as soon as possible.
Hey. This is Murphy.
I'm trying to get a hold of you.
I...
I have not heard from Electra...
in a long time and...
Please call me back when you get this.
See if I can help find her.
OK. Thank you.
It is true she had issues.
It's true, she was a junkie.
I'd forgive everything.
I will always love her.
If she would forgive me.
Please Electra, come back to me.
Come back. Come back.
Come back.
I want to be in your arms.
I want you to hug me.
To hold me.
Please hug me. Please hold me.
You are so hot this morning.
Can I fuck you?
I want to make movies
out of blood, sperm and tears.
That's so sweet.
This is like the essence of life.
I think movies should contain that.
Or should be made of that.
- What is your favorite movie?
- 2001.
What do you think of this movie?
I never saw.
You've never seen 2001?
What is wrong with you?
You've never seen this movie?
Will you show me?
Yes. I have to.
You're ignorant.
I need to show you the light.
This is like the reason
I wanna be a director.
- But I like poetry too.
- Yes?
You want to hear my favorite poet?
Definitely.
I think it goes something like...
I know how love can be
dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep.
And miles to go before I sleep.
And miles to go before I sleep.
What do you think of this place?
- It's cool, right?
- I love it.
What if I got you pregnant?
I think I would be happy.
You think?
If we can make more than one.
You want more?
- Seven.
- Seven?
This is a reasonable number.
Lucky number.
What are we going to do
with all these kids?
Start a farm?
Big happy family,
that would make your mom happy.
I think.
I don't really talk with her.
And I'm not sure
I can introduce you to my father.
I think you are too crazy.
And what about you, princess?
He doesn't know I drink.
You drink just as much as I do.
He thinks I'm an angel.
Is he conservative?
Religious?
Electra has a daddy complex.
I love Paris.
I don't like my last year.
My last five years, but...
I like Paris.
You don't like your past here?
Maybe I don't like
my past in general.
But I see a great future coming.
Long life.
Long life behind you.
It is hard to see what's ahead.
Great love?
I think we should try.
Tell me about your ex-boyfriend.
I love you, my love.
- What's his name?
- Noe.
He was nice.
But we don't talk anymore.
He left me.
He was hot, but he wanted younger.
- Younger than you?
- Yes.
And your ex-girlfriend?
Lucile.
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.
Do you have a nice apartment in Paris?
Yes.
Why?
I was just wondering if I came there
if I could stay with you?
You are the love of my life.
Hey?
Can I tell you a secret?
What is your secret?
I forgot.
Do you have a secret?
Yes.
So this is your ex's gallery?
Yeah, it is.
It is huge.
Electra.
- Good to see you.
- Me too.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- Your brother, I guess.
- No.
Murphy, my boyfriend.
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.
- I told you about him.
- You're the artist.
Filmmaker.
And what do you do?
I'm making movies.
- You are here in Paris or New York?
- Here, Paris.
So you're here for a while.
- For a while.
- Welcome, welcome.
- So...
- So...
- Life is good?
- Yes.
- Have you been traveling lately?
- Yes. As usual.
Bangkok, with my kids.
- The worst one.
- Wife and kids?
- I want to introduce you to a big guy.
- Yes.
- Do you want to come?
- Yes.
Can I bring him to the
party you told me?
Of course.
- There's a party? Be my guest.
- Yes. Next week.
And bring your movies one day.
- Alright.
- Come, come.
Piece of shit.
- You're a bitch.
- Hey!
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.
He is a nice guy.
No need to be...
jealous, it's over.
I hope you got a good contract.
I hope he pays a lot.
He just introduced me to a nice guy.
Come on.
- He wants to fuck you.
- No. It's over.
Do you think we will
stay together forever?
"Forever" is a long time.
I should hope so.
"Forever" is a long time.
You are not playing with truth.
What?
I am a very peaceful person, if you...
tell me about your desire.
We have to make a promise.
That from now on...
We will be the greatest couple
ever lived.
We are already.
What can we do?
Talk straight away about our feelings.
Say to each other what we want to do.
You can do whatever
you want, if you want me do.
- Anything I want?
- Yes. You can have all the freedom...
to ask me do.
- Yes?
- Yes.
Do you still love me?
You know I do.
You still love me?
Yes. Are you drunk?
I just want that...
sincere answer.
I fucking love You.
I'm sorry.
Hey. Baby.
- You know what?
- No.
- What?
- You want to be in my movie?
Show me your star face.
- You love me?
- I love you.
Will you make me look good?
You know what? I'm not a good person.
- I'm not a good person.
- You are not a good person?
Make me look like I was...
What?
Hey!
- Play the game.
- I'm playing the game.
You're naughty!
That's not funny.
Answer the question.
- You're so stubborn.
You just took the last
picture you had in your camera.
I think...
- I have a few more.
- Yes?
So I think that unless
pretend it's romantic...
- You know what I think about you?
- What?
- You're an amazing guy.
- But...
No. But... You're an amazing guy.
But...?
You're an amazing guy.
Who doesn't know what love means.
Electra.
I'm so glad I met you.
So, anyway, Julio...
Listen, I was wondering
if you heard from Electra?
No. Not for a long time. No.
She kinda disappeared.
- And now I am in rehab.
- You are in rehab?
Yes. So I haven't talked to her.
I haven't seen her.
She was hanging out
with Sherid and Camile.
- And Sherid had problems with the police.
- Yes.
But... Listen.
I am pretty hungover.
I don't do drugs anymore.
But I got drunk last night.
- I'm not alone, so I'll call you later.
- It's okay.
But hey! Stay away from her.
Thank you. I'm glad to see you and...
to meet one of
your friends. Finally.
So...
Murphy, what are you doing in Paris?
I am a filmmaker.
He is studying.
I am studying still, yeah.
So you are an artist?
- Exactly.
- Like my daughter.
Mama likes art.
I do. I do.
And, how did you meet?
In a party. My school party
in a park.
Long ago?
I bet.
OK. I understand.
I'll come back in a second.
Sorry.
- I'd like to ask you a question.
- Sure.
I saw drugs. I think cocaine,
at Electra's apartment.
- Really?
- I found some. Yes.
- But she's not that kind of girl.
- Of course she is not.
Of course not.
That's why I'm
asking you. Do you do drugs?
- Me?
- Yes.
No, never.
Is there anything left?
Why?
So I get some more.
It is not as good.
Who gave it to you?
- Julio.
- Julio?
- My Julio?
- Yes. Your friend Julio.
Why?
That's weird.
- Why?
- How did you get Julio's number?
You are paranoid, right?
I took it from your phone.
- Can we have more?
- I have no more.
No more cocaine, eh?
No more cocaine.
Baby, he's not a drug dealer.
He is our friend.
Do you have, dear friend,
something else to give us?
I do have something else actually.
- It's an ecstasy.
- That'll do.
Blue.
Two each.
Two each, honey.
Your two.
- What about taking one now and...
- Trust me girl.
- Let's break one now and try.
- For your own protection.
It's for your own protection.
Now they are safe.
You know, my ex-girlfriend, Lucile.
She's been relaxing with
Shala-la lately.
She invited us to a spiritual
journey with her.
Maybe it's time to purge the body.
Cleanse the soul.
Ayahuasca?
Just don't shit in
pants, brother.
I'll be alright.
This is not a drug.
Don't misunderstand me, but...
you have to look
farther. This is not...
This is like a huge teacher
showing you the reality.
What we see is not...
Yuyo. Hello.
Do you know what my
biggest dream in life is?
My biggest dream is to
make a movie that truly
depicts sentimental sexuality.
She doesn't care. He has heard
this a million times before.
- Yes. I like it.
- You like it?
- Yes.
- Why?
Why we have not we seen this in cinema?
- Yes. Why? I agree.
- I'm sentimental.
We should be like babies.
- Yes. I agree with you.
- Are you an actress?
- Yes.
- What is your name?
- Paula.
- Lola?
Yes. I am Paula. I am French.
- But I like to speak English, you know.
- Yes.
- That's very good.
- Yes.
What is best in life?
Love.
Love.
And after that.
- Sex.
- Yes.
And you can combine the two and...
have sex while you're in love.
That is the best. I want to see that.
- I want to see...
- Do you have a cigarette, please?
I don't have. It's okay.
- According. Thank you.
- Do you want me to show something?
- I'll show you something.
- It's okay.
- Follow me. Come.
- Sure.
Lovely.
You're so nice.
- You look surprised.
- That's not cocaine.
Oh yeah.
- I have a girlfriend.
- Yes. Me too.
You don't have to worry.
- You want me?
- Can you keep a secret?
I love secrets.
Upside down.
I'm sorry. I am drunk.
- Here we go.
- What did you say?
Nothing.
That bitch.
Hello.
Don't touch me.
Are you okay?
What the fuck were you
doing with this girl?
- She wanted do coke.
- Yes. And what about you ...?
- Fly?
- Than?
Close your fly.
Shit.
You know, I was knocking.
- The music is loud.
- Yes. Not enough...
not me to hear
what you were doing.
- What are you talking about?
- I hear you.
OK. What are you talking about?
- You were fucking that girl.
- No. I was not.
She just wanted a kiss?
Every fucking man is the same.
Anyway I cheated on you a week ago.
What?
What?
- I cheated...
- With who?
With who I could
have cheated? Noe.
Noe. When?
When were you planning on telling me this?
I did not want to tell you this because...
That's not what I asked.
I asked you...?
When were you planning to tell me?
I was afraid that you...
I told you. Would you then
reveal to me...
You've been fucking
your ex-boyfriend.
- It's your fault!
- It's my fault? How so?
- Your fucking fault.
- Explain it, because I'm fucking stupid.
I'm so stupid I actually believed...
Really...
Calm down, calm down please.
Thank you.
I really believed that
you were anything...
but a fucking whore.
Which is what you are. You're not
a painter. You have no talent.
You'll never ever sell a
fucking painting in your whole life.
I am so stupid to believe,
this piece of shit...
You will ever sell one of
your worthless pieces of shit.
- He believes in my damn paintings.
- Bullshit. You have no talent.
- You have no talent.
- You are worse!
I actually like him better than you.
Because at least he's honest.
At least he can do one thing.
Which is trick
stupid cunt like yourself.
You're like all men...
You even suck cock well.
They just want
fuck me because I'm pretty.
- And you know what?
- Even more. Even...
Never, you will never be a good mother.
Never!
You'll never be a good mother of a child,
because you are a venomous cunt.
I think then we don't understand.
I want a nice, nice family.
Where we think that love exists.
This is your dream?
No. This is becoming
a fucking nightmare.
This is your dream.
Hey, chill down. You wanted to come.
You could have stayed at home.
- Your bourgeois French friends.
- Why are you dressed like that?
With their heads so far up their asses.
- You're being a pain...
- It makes me nauseated.
- What are you doing? Control yourself.
- I want to throw up.
Then go to the toilet. Then
take a taxi and go home to sleep.
- I'm having fun.
- Yes?
- Look at me go.
- Where are you going?
Princess.
Hey?
- I am going home.
- I'm having fun.
Enjoy.
Enjoy.
He looks drunk.
Please please please.
Look at me.
- Hey, let's go home.
- Remember me?
Hey, come on.
Of course I remember you,
but you should not drink that much.
Hey, let's go home.
Let's go home.
Who is she?
- My wife.
- Victoire.
- Your wife?
- Nice to meet you.
Please, please, please.
Did you know that your husband
is fucking my girlfriend?
What?! What the fuck are you saying?!
- Come on. Come on.
- Do you have a headache?
No. I don't have a headache.
Piece of shit!
I'm gonna take you to the cops.
Piece of shit.
Thanks, Electra.
I am the victim in this situation.
Me. Not him.
He is walking out there on the street
right now, laughing about this.
He has a cut on the head,
yet he has fucked up my life.
He is fucking up the life of his wife,
of his kids, me and my girlfriend.
And it is...
Calm down. Look, you're drunk,
obviously you're drunk.
I'm drunk, yes. I'm drunk.
Okay. Okay.
But that doesn't change...
Calm down, okay?
No, not that tone.
What if he was
fucking your girlfriend?
I am asking the questions here.
I'm trying to make you see my point.
You don't solve things like that.
You beat him.
- I'm proud of what I did.
- You don't regret?
I'm proud of what I did.
Fucking France.
1918 was the last time
you guys won a war.
Since then what have you done?
Nothing.
You sit in your asses eating...
Stop now, okay?! Stop.
I am an American.
- I am an American.
- And? Above the law?
No. We fight for what we believe in.
And that guy, that guy is nothing.
He is a rat.
He is nothing. He is less than nothing.
I like that cop.
That cop was a jerk.
- He understood me.
- Why was I doing ...?
Why was this cop asking questions
about my sex life?
- Because I am a man.
- Stupid...
That's one thing that
women don't understand.
The men understand
to each other.
We have respect for one another.
It was supposed to keep it a
secret, but he took my number...
because he says
he wanted to buy me a drink.
Then go with him.
Yes.
What I did was correct.
I protected my woman.
Don't touch me!
Hey!
So this is how you repay me?
After everything I did for you?
- I was taking care of you.
- Just shut up.
- I don't want to see you anymore.
- Electra.
That cop agreed with me.
You can ask him.
Hello.
I didn't treat you like a bitch,
at that fucking gallery.
It is over!
Cunt.
I'm not a pussy.
Maybe I should call
my little friend.
Pussy is pussy.
This is really in my head right now.
It's okay.
It's not you. This does
not normally happen.
So...
Are you sad?
Your heart is broken?
I'm just pissed off.
- Why?
- Why?
Yes.
I just broke up with my girlfriend.
That hurts.
I know.
But, you know, it's gonna happen
a lot of times in your life...
And you're going to be
that sad all the time?
If you fall in love. Really
you are the loser.
You understand me?
- Am I the loser?
- Yes.
Hello?
Hey? Hey!
Really?
What do you want? I'm sleeping.
Can we meet?
I hate you.
Electra?
Okay. Let's meet.
Where are you?
Wait.
Slowly.
It is real.
Maybe one day we can try...
"Love at eight months.
A pregnant love story."
"Fist Fuck Made in Germany".
It is a propaganda film.
Some people are sick for real.
Hey!
These people...
are unafraid.
No. Maybe I just watch.
Can you hold that?
I don't want you to come back
to my police station...
to my office, because you beat
another guy who looked at your girlfriend.
- This will not happen again.
- Yes. But for that you need to...
free yourself from that feeling.
You need to forget about that.
You know, it's.. forget about it. You are
in France here, forget about your...
American feeling of
possession, of ownership.
Of war, or violence.
Try to feel differently.
In the U.S...
in the '60s, you were different.
People were loving each other.
What's wrong about going to a club
and fucking all the women?
Because you know you will fuck
all the women in your life.
But you will fuck all
the women in your life in her back.
Here, you do it with her.
It develops your confidence, your trust.
I'm sure you will like it.
There are gorgeous women.
Beautiful women.
It's clean, it's nice. There is music.
Nicer than a normal club.
Don't think about it like
filthy club or something like that.
- Its beautiful. It's clean.
- You go every week or what?
We go often. Not every
week, but often. Yes.
And I live with my sexuality
in a good way.
I feel relaxed, calm, balanced.
I don't have the feeling you have.
I don't beat people.
And that's probably the most beautiful
thing you can do with your girlfriend.
Just to know that she has some
other desire and you offer her that desire.
Bring her. She will enjoy it.
Plus she will enjoy watching you
fucking another woman.
As long as she knows
you come back with her.
We go often and
we are cool. Look, we are friends.
- When is the best time you're go?
- Friday, Saturday.
- The weekend. Weekend.
- Yes.
You have plenty of people, so
plenty of choice.
You can pick up the one you want
or you can watch.
I love watching.
Murphy!
- Come on.
- What?
- Right now?
- Come on.
Please.
I'm sorry.
You loved it. You were in Heaven.
I looked over, and you were jerking
some French retard's cock off.
You were so sad that you were
fucking all the girls?
All the girls? You were
fucking another girl.
- You wanted me to fuck.
- It's something I wanted now?
No!
I didn't even know
you wanted us to
bring this place
shit to begin with.
- You wanted to go there.
- I know. I know.
And we said we would do
everything together.
Well, I think I had a boner.
According?
So don't let me be so
stupid next time, please.
You fucked two
girls at the same time.
I fucked two guys at the same time.
- Don't.
- If you wanted you could join us.
- If I want I can join?
- Yes.
You live in fear.
What about a tranny?
You want to fuck a tranny?
It would be a good compromise.
Some boobs, some cocks.
You are fucking crazy.
What about you?
Hi baby.
Mummy has some warm milk.
For you.
Look.
Look.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Don't be afraid.
- Don't be afraid. Feel it.
- I can't. I can't.
I can't. I thought I could,
but I can't, I can't.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't.
No no no no!
I can't. I can't. I can't.
No no no no.
I'm sorry. I thought I could.
- I'm sorry.
- Why so sorry?
Why are you sorry?
Relax, no problem.
I want you.
I want sex with you.
I think I had blacked out.
Come on.
Don't worry.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
I wish I could erase
that thing from my mind.
Don't make such a big drama.
Promise me, you will never
tell anyone about this.
There is nothing to hide.
Can I just say it to Julio?
Secrets make you stronger.
No?
Secrets make you darker.
You know what?
If we had to break up,
I would probably disappear.
How many guys have you left?
This is not the point.
The guy I left I wasn't in love.
Let's try to protect...
protect each other.
I love you.
I love you too.
I'm not painting your stuff.
We are taking so much
drugs. I do.
Yeah, and it's raining.
And it's cold, and...
maybe we are not the great artists
that we dreamt we were.
Maybe...
this is all just shit.
I guess I should sleep
in my place for a while.
Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.
I feel like we're losing time and...
I'm not always a
a good influence on you.
And you're not a very
great influence on me.
Yes, maybe we should
take a break.
You know, sometimes I
miss your ponytail too.
Sometimes I miss to
laugh.
We lost joy
when we met.
When we first met?
At the park.
- No. I mean later.
- It seems like a long time ago.
And you weren't wearing these.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You're having a good time?
- Yes. It's my favorite park.
- Cool.
- But I have to go.
- Yes?
Yes.
I'll walk with you.
- No, it's fine.
- No, really.
I'll walk with you. It will be more fun.
It will be nice.
Anyway, you have to be careful,
because Paris is a
really dangerous city...
With all the foreigners around.
- Where do you come from?
- America.
You?
I'm from... everywhere.
- One sec. Julio.
- What's up? Where are you going?
I'll be right back. I'll catch you later.
Very good.
From everywhere?
I mean,
My blood is mixed, well...
Celine, I will call you. Bye.
- They are my school mates.
- Yes?
- I'm in Art School.
- Cool.
And what are you doing in Paris?
I'm in film school.
Are you in love?
I have someone.
Of course you do. All
best girls have someone.
But they are not all happy.
But you didn't say
you were in love with him.
I don't know anything about
love, in my mind...
It is like a place
where you don't want to live.
- OK?
- You can be who you want to be.
So you've been in love.
You know how it feels, but
you're no longer there.
You left.
Yes, I mean. It happened that
you end up in a situation...
where you feel the lack
of love around you.
Not only like in a relationship.
I mean, love is love.
Love is life. Love is light.
- Hey, not that way.
- This way?
- Yes.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
It makes people...
bright.
Yes. It also makes people crazy.
A young person without love is like...
Like a sparrow without air.
Oh, you did not know you
could fly, did you?
That's what I want to do.
It is true. You think I'm joking?
I'm serious.
I'm fucking serious right now.
Look, we live one life.
When we are born, we know
we're gonna die.
So what is the
point to keep on fighting?
For what?
There is no hope, because...
We should just commit suicide.
I don't want... I don't
want to say goodbye.
Hey...
What is the meaning of life?
Love.
What is your name?
Murphy.
- What's yours?
- Electra.
I want to fuck you so much.
So much.
Will you promise me something?
No matter what...
we protect each other from anyone
will ever stand between us.
I promise.
I promise too.
Are you afraid of death?
I am afraid of pain.
I don't want to die in pain.
I rather...
commit suicide.
Please. Please. Please.
God!
Tell me she's okay.
I don't want anything bad to happen to her.
Just tell me she's okay.
Tell me she is still happy.
Tell me she's alive.
No.
Please, God!
Tell me, this isn't true.
No. No. No.
I want to go back.
I want to go back to the first night.
I want to wake up with her.
Grant me this one wish.
Please, let me do that.
And I swear that I will have a good life.
I swear. I swear to you.
But what if I end up in a place that hurts.
This world is ours.
Life is what you make of it.
I'll be good.
Like a dream.
I'll be true.
I like you.
I like you too.
Electra, I love you.
There is nothing after death.
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Did you come inside me?
When you die.
You die with your memories.
Murphy.
I love you so much.
If one day I die...
I would love to know that,
you fall in love again.
And again.
And again.
Dad.
Come here.
Come to Daddy.
Gaspar, I'm sorry.
Life is not easy.
Someday you'll see it.
Please forgive me.
I'm lost.
Please.
Don't you ever leave me.
I promise...
I will love you till the end.
