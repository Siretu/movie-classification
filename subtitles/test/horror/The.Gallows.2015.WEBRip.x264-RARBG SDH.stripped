[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WOMAN: Could you make a copy
for us, as well?
MAN: I'll have to figure out
how to do this
when it's all done.
I'm just...
And Jean was not happy
'cause, boy,
was this thing expensive.
Oh, August.
What shall we do?
Don't worry, Mary.
He wants me.
He's coming for me
and... and no one else.
Do you understand?
August, I'm frightened.
I know, Mary.
Art thou afraid?
WOMAN: Charlie's doing
such a good job.
I am no more.
MAN:
Yeah, I'm really surprised
considering the last-minute
change, but it looks good.
August... kiss me.
No, please don't.
Please don't do it, August.
Please.
[ APPLAUSE ]
Do you... do you know
what they're doing
for the spring play,
by any chance?
No, I have no idea.
Um...
[ APPLAUSE STOPS ]
They did a great job
on the Gallows.
[ CLEARS THROAT ]
For crimes against
the township of bedford...
Including robbery... Perjury...
Adultery...
And fraternizing with a noble...
I hereby sentence you...
August Benjamin Rutherford...
To death...
By hanging
on this 29th day...
[ CROWD MURMURING ]
YOUNG WOMAN: Charlie?! Charlie?!
Charlie!! Charlie!!
Oh, my...
Oh, my God!
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]
MAN: Grab him!
Grab him!
[ GIRL SCREAMS ]
Get a doctor!
He's not breathing!
Get a doctor!
MR. SCHWENDIMAN: Lights up.
All right.
Let's nail this, guys.
RYAN:
[ CHUCKLES ] Yeah.
Let's nail this,
Mr. Schwendiman.
You got it.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Oh, August, you came.
Oh.
Don't worry, my love.
They're... He's coming for...
He wants me.
MR. SCHWENDIMAN: Project nice
and loud to the back, please.
[ LAUGHTER ]
RYAN: Come on, Reese.
[ LOUDER ] He wants me.
He's coming for me.
Is she gonna throw up?
Dost...
Dost thou understand?
[ CHUCKLES ]
Thou... Thou shall be safe here?
[ LAUGHTER ]
Oh, August... For
I am frightened.
Art thou?
Dig deep.
Find those tears.
Not anymore.
[ LAUGHING ]
Oh, what? Dude.
August... Just give
me one last kiss.
Is he gonna do it
this time?
Here it is, bro.
Pucker up
for that theater nerd.
- Yeah.
- MR. SCHWENDIMAN: Cut.
RYAN: Oh. Ohh!
- MR. SCHWENDIMAN: Reese.
- Yeah?
RYAN: [ LAUGHS ]
Nice job, dude.
MR. SCHWENDIMAN:
Pfeifer, great job.
Thank you.
Everyone else,
that was good.
God, she's obnoxious.
A little more work
on the lines, Reese.
Yeah, you need
to work on 'em.
You need a little bit
more work on them...
Before tomorrow night.
Oh.
Yeah, take a Moment right now...
The play is tomorrow.
...and just go over
those pages again.
Wow.
Jesus.
Oh, Reese,
you're breakin' my poor heart!
Oh, this is good.
For those of you
watching along at home,
that is why football players
do not do drama.
Ryan.
You're supposed to stay
in the booth.
No.
Hey, Reese.
Can I borrow your blouse?
[ LAUGHS ]
Why, man?
I need some clarity, bro.
Help me out here.
Isn't this embarrassing, dude?
Like, you're chokin'
worse than Charlie did.
[ SCHOOL BELL RINGS,
REESE SIGHS ]
Dude, they're gonna
tear you apart in here.
Don't do it!
Don't bring the camera
in the locker room.
This is more booby
than the girl locker room.
Dude,
this isn't the girl's.
Who brings a camera
into the men's locker room?
Oh, my God.
Get that shit outta here.
That's disgusting.
No one wants to see that.
- My boy's gonna be a superstar!
- Yes!
Whoo-Hoo-Hoo!
Look at those tights,
Peter Pan!
RYAN: Yo, are you serious?
Why can't you just stay
up in the booth?
I was in the booth, dude.
The booth camera sucks.
That's why I have my camera.
Besides, I have practice.
Come on.
You coulda done shop.
You coulda done home EC.
You're wearing knickers, bro!
Come on.
Reese.
Knickers, dude!
Stop walking.
I'll find you, Reese.
Hey, big shot.
Get suited up. Let's go.
[ WHISTLE BLOWS ]
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]
There's Miss Shannon.
Do you still have a husband,
Miss Shannon?
[ SMOOCHES ]
Goodbye.
Love you, too.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MAN: And another one up!
[ WHISTLE BLOWS ]
[ WHISTLE BLOWS ]
[ SMOOCHES ]
RYAN: Cassidy!
MAN: Ryan! Come on.
Cassidy!
What're you doin'?
Told you not to mess with this!
It's not a toy.
Pssh.
Don't "pssh" me!
So, what's it like
being a drama techie?
- Such a bitch. Are you kidding?
- Whoa!
What? If I had known
there was a drama requirement...
RYAN: I love it.
I love it.
I mean, I get to hang out with
the most unattractive girls.
I'm late to practice
every day.
- Hey, Ryan, how's drama?
- Oh, how's drama?
Yeah, how's it hanging out with all
your new little drama buddies?
At least I'm not around you,
squirt.
Are you trying to defend
your little drama buddies?
Yeah, well, your Mom.
- Hey, big shot!
- Yes, coach!
- Practice? Hello?
- Yeah, Ryan.
Let's go, big shot!
Hey, there they are!
There's some of your buddies
right there.
RYAN: They're not my buddies.
Take this.
Take this thing, man.
[ LAUGHTER ]
- Watch this.
- Oh, my God. Oh, no.
It's up!
It's up!
ALL: Ohh!
Go get the trainer!
- Nailed it!
- Vicious.
Right in the schnoz,
dude.
RYAN:
Yo, David, how ya doing?
Hey, what's happenin'?
- Working late tonight?
- You know it.
- Time for a vacation, huh?
- You guessed that, too.
And here's the 1993 cast.
Just as geeky as now.
AND THERE HE IS:
Charlie Grimille.
Unbelievably morbid
that they still have a picture
of him up here.
Don't forget your costume.
Chris, turn off
the cell phones, please.
In the drama room
as well as the theater.
That's the rule.
RYAN: Turn them off
or be suspended!
No cell phone, okay?
No cell phones.
All right. Now listen up.
Eyes forward, everyone.
Tomorrow night is the show.
It's been a long process.
Not always easy, right, Pfeifer?
Especially not
with the school board,
but we got through that.
But, um, I think
we're gonna do okay.
Pfeifer, you had a couple
of words you wanted to say.
Go ahead.
Of course
she has something to say.
Thank you, guys.
First off, I would like you guys
to take a peek at the programs.
They're done,
and they are identical
to the 1993 ones.
- Oh, my God. Thank God.
- So thank you, Brittany.
Thank you guys so much
for helping me
make this show possible.
We've worked so hard.
We've had such a great time.
I feel so proud to be
a part of the Gallows.
I just can't wait
to see it finally finished.
Me neither.
C'est Fini!
So thank you guys.
MR. SCHWENDIMAN:
Thank you, Pfeifer.
[ APPLAUSE ]
Our assistant director,
Pfeifer Ross, everyone.
And what do we say?
- Break a leg.
- Break a leg, Reese.
MR. SCHWENDIMAN:
Thank you, guys. Let's go.
RYAN: Backstage.
- Shoos! Mr. BHS.
- What's up, my man?
- Oh, look at this.
- What are you doing in here?
- My two favorite characters.
- Peasant number five, Hangman.
You guys even have lines?
- I think I clap or something.
- There you go.
If coach could see you guys now,
you'd be kicked off in a second.
Yeah, get that camera
outta here, man.
It's a mandatory class, man.
Thanks for bringing
this stuff.
It's like Halloween
down here.
- Yeah, most definitely.
- Yeah, party cen...
Oh, ho.
What do we have here?
What is this thing?
- That's the old Hangman costume.
- Looks pretty dumb.
Some kid told us
not to touch it.
Did a little drama nerd
tell you not to touch it?
I think he told me, too.
But then I didn't listen to him
'cause I'm such a badass.
MR. SCHWENDIMAN: Dan and mark,
can I see you guys up on stage?
- Ryan!
- Yeah?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
I know that you don't take
any of this seriously, okay?
I don't. I'm sorry.
No, I will.
Okay. It's important
to a lot of people.
So show a little respect
in the theater, okay?
- All right.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Yeah, right.
Look at him in those Khakis.
What a joke.
I'm fine.
- What are you doin'?
- I don't know.
Just trying
to get through this thing.
- What are you doing?
- What?
Oh, I'm Charlie.
I'm dead.
Oh.
Oh, I got a trick for you guys.
Watch.
Watch this.
Ready?
How creepy is that?
God.
Yo, yo, yo.
Dude.
Smile for the camera, man.
Aw, come on.
Look, I'm sorry about
hitting you with the football.
You were wide open.
Come on.
Can I at least
help you with this stuff?
No.
And don't touch the fly rigs.
They're dangerous.
Wow.
Okay, stage boy.
August is not
who he seems he is, Mary.
To the audience, John.
Can't you see?
He is pretending to be a noble
that he might win your love.
YOUNG MAN: He should turn himself in.
He must be hanged!
August will not turn himself in!
He loves me!
But, sir, the Hangman
will take Mary in his place.
KING:
His sentence is death.
RYAN: [ CHUCKLES ] Nerd.
MARY: What shall I do?
What shall I do, father?
RYAN: Reese, come on.
- Now, Reese.
- What shall I do, father?
- Reese!
- [ LAUGHS ]
- There he is.
- Good timing, Reese.
- Don't come out with the book.
- "What shall I do?"
And then you come in.
RYAN:
The parents of the nerds.
There they are.
And look at these guys.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Contain your excitement,
gentlemen.
I don't even know
if this lady's a parent.
She's here literally every day.
Sits in the same spot.
RYAN: Wait, so you were in the old show?
The original show.
- Like the original?
- Yep. I was there.
What was that like?
I don't know if you ever recover
from something like this.
It was... horrifying.
The students were upset.
The teachers were upset.
- Charlie had a girlfriend.
- He had a girlfriend?
Oh, I didn't really know her,
but she was devastated.
I've been here when my kids have
been here, and things have happened.
Lights have gone on when there was
no one in the lighting booth.
Doors have been opened
and shut and locked.
There's all kinds of stories
around here.
[ CHUCKLING ]
Oh, no, no, no.
They're Patty-Caking!
He's slapping hands
with another dude.
And zero hot girls.
Ew.
And the queen.
Not in a million years.
[ LAUGHS ]
I hate this class.
Hollywood!
- What's up, brother?
- Hey.
What are you doin'?
Practicin'?
Mm-hmm.
Is it workin'?
Yeah, I didn't think so.
[ LAUGHS ]
It makes no sense, dude.
I mean, this is torture.
Why don't you just
call out sick? You know?
- Put an end to this.
- I can't call out sick.
I call out sick two to three
times a week, minimum.
Just do it.
I have a responsibility
to these people.
I'm the lead in the play.
To what people?
What are you talking about?
A responsibility to these guys?
Come on.
You're just go...
Give me this.
Holy shi... Reese?
Do you like Pfeifer?
- No, Ryan. No.
- You do!
Don't you?
You like Pfeifer!
Ryan, seriously,
no, I don't.
That's why you're doing this?
Oh, my God.
Does she know?
- Ryan.
- She doesn't know.
- I don't... Ryan.
- She doesn't.
Reese, your boy's got this,
dude.
- Stop it, Ryan.
- Just talk to Schwendiman.
I got this one, man.
[ LAUGHS ]
Hey, drama queen!
Hey, hey, hey!
Pfeifer!
- Hey, Ryan!
- Wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
I need to talk to you about
Reese.
What about Reese?
He has
a big-ass crush on you.
Like, he wants to be on you.
Pfeifer, please.
Talk to me about Reese.
- Yes.
- What's goin' on there?
Reese is gonna do great.
I have complete faith in him.
He knows his lines.
He's gonna be fine.
Are you kidding me?
Everybody knows he's gonna choke
like Charlie did.
We don't say that name, Ryan.
I've told you that.
- It's bad luck.
- I'm sorry.
I don't get you drama nerds
and your jargon.
It's like, "good luck"
is bad luck.
Breaking a leg is supposed to be
a good thing?
Exactly!
And "C'est Fini"?
What the hell is that?
Oh, my God.
Pfeifer, back to the point.
After the show bombs,
how is it gonna affect
you and Reese?
The show isn't going to bomb,
Ryan, okay?
We're gonna finish the show.
It's gonna look great!
C'est Fini!
C'est Fi-what?
You're from Nebraska.
- Ryan!
- What?
Price needs you.
Who's price?
The stage manager.
The stage man... [
CHUCKLING ] Oh.
Stage boy. Yeah.
Hey there, chief.
How you doin', bud?
What can I help you with?
It's number 28 here.
It's just a little too heavy
for me, you know.
You can do it.
I probably can.
Yes.
You just can't...
It's pretty stuck.
Is it this one?
YOUNG MAN:
Price got some balls, dude.
You just need it pulled down?
It's fine
if you can't do it.
- Are you sure it's this one?
- It's this one.
It's fine
if you can't do it.
I can do it.
It just needs a good pull.
[ CLATTERING ]
ALL: Ohh!
[ LAUGHTER ]
That's gonna leave a mark.
PRICE:
Smile for the camera!
[ LAUGHTER CONTINUES ]
Come here, you sick... hey!
Stage... hey!
- Come here, boy!
- No, no, look!
Look, it was just a joke!
We're even! We're even!
It was a joke?!
It was not funny!
- It was not a funny joke!
- Please don't hurt me!
- Okay!
- What?!
Stop, Ryan!
Come on, price.
- Come on. Ryan.
- You're lucky, boy.
- Ryan, stop.
- We're even.
No. This isn't over.
Price. You okay?
Yeah.
[ HINGES CREAKING ]
RYAN: What?
[ HINGES CREAKING ]
No way.
Hey, hey, Brooke.
It's Kelly.
Okay.
What is up with this door?
It's broken.
Everybody knows that.
No.
What? Reese!
Reese! Dude.
Dude, Reese. My man.
Oh!
What?
Do you still
wanna do this play?
Are you kidding me?
Okay. Listen.
I was talking to Pfeifer
and that stupid stage boy,
and I was chasing him,
but I found this door.
I found a door over here
that's unlocked.
It never locks.
Always open.
What are you guys
talking about?
What'd she say?
Who?
Pfeifer.
Oh, my God, Reese.
You like Pfeifer?
Oh. Reese.
This is your chance.
We break into the school
tonight.
We come in through that door.
We ruin the set.
Ten minutes. You don't have to
do the play anymore.
That's awesome.
Cassidy, please.
What do you think, Reese?
[ CHUCKLES ]
You're insane, man.
Reese, it's a great plan.
- No!
- Why not?
No! Ryan, this is illegal.
Put the camera down.
Why would you even
want to film this?
Bail on the show.
If I bail on this show,
they all hate me.
Esp... especially Pfeifer.
And if you don't bail
on the show,
you let everyone down
and they all hate you.
Especially Pfeifer.
Dude, I'm done.
I'm done sugarcoating
this whole thing.
You suck.
You're a terrible actor,
and you need to do
something about it.
Why not do something
that's not your fault?
Tear this mother down.
Look, they're gonna come in
tomorrow.
They're gonna be like,
"oh, my God! The set's broken.
What are we gonna do?"
And who's there for Pfeifer
to lean on in her time of need?
Dude, you are!
It's a win!
- I'm a freakin' genius!
- You're not a genius.
What time?
You're not coming, Cassidy.
Yes, I'm coming.
No, you're not.
You're a Cheerleader.
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?
You didn't let me finish.
You're a Cheerleader that likes
to do other girl dance stuff,
not cool, awesome, scary stuff
at the school at night.
I'll pick you up at 9:00.
Okay. Dude.
Are you in?
Do you have tools?
Yes, Reese!
Yeah.
Yeah, I got tools.
God, Reese. I can't believe
you like Pfeifer.
Shut up!
Why did you tell her?
Boo!
[ GROWLS ]
All right.
Between you and me...
[ DOOR OPENS ]
- Ryan?
- Mom! What are you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.
What are you...
What are you doing, Mom?
I told you that I just needed
five minutes.
All right, baby.
Stay in here.
In and out, babe.
Please.
[ CHUCKLES ]
That's what she said.
Trick or treat, Housers.
- This play is...
- Why is it so important to you?
RICK: You know,
you don't understand.
I don't want you
doing this play.
REESE: Why do you care?
I just don't wanna do football.
You should've stayed
on the football team.
Finish things that you start.
You don't walk away.
- Like a flake.
- Yo. Yo, Reese.
All right,
well, I gotta go.
- Damn, man.
- What?
- Rick Houser.
- Evening, Ryan.
How ya doin'?
Dandy. What's this?
A camera.
For the play.
- Play, huh?
- Yep.
School night,
all right, buddy?
Yeah, I know. We're just goin'
over to Ryan's for a little.
Don't worry, Mr. Houser.
We'll have him back by bedtime.
- 'Sup.
- Hi, Reese.
- Yeah.
- Back seat, babe.
You got it.
Reese.
Your Dad's got a point, man.
He doesn't have...
I'm not my Dad, Ryan.
I know.
That would be impossible.
But you didn't need
to quit the team.
Well, I quit the team.
And I'm not gettin' back
on the team.
Okay.
Can we talk for...
Babe, two seconds.
It's like watching an infant
roll around on the stage.
Gosh, you're just
a wonderful best friend.
Okay, excuse me. Reese,
can you please explain to us
what it is about Pfeifer,
'cause I don't see it.
I don't get it. I'm pretty sure you don't.
Right, babe?
Here is him on sta...
Pf-pf-pf-Pfeifer.
C-c-can I k-k-kiss you?
You almost kissed
a real girl once, right?
Come on!
Yes, I've kissed her.
- I think I remember.
- Who?
I've kissed plenty of girls.
She's really... she's a
she's a nice person.
- She really is.
- "A nice person"?
Just sit down and talk to her
for like five minutes.
All right,
all right, all right.
- Here we go.
- Dude, I'm so stoked.
I cannot believe
you talked me into this.
No one's gonna believe
that we did this.
Can I get a "for Pfeifer"
on three.
One, two, three.
For Pfeifer!
- I'm not joining in on that.
- You're a...
[ GRUNTS ]
You're sure it's fine
to park the car there?
Yeah, dude.
It's completely fine.
So relax.
Can I get some stealth,
please?
Fu... Jesus! [ LAUGHS ]
Get up, babe!
Babe, get up!
This is so stupid.
This is stupid.
My boy, Reese Houser.
Just lower your voice
just a little bit.
Tradin' in his baby balls
for some big ol' man testes.
Moment of truth.
Do the honors.
Do it, dude.
Come on.
Okay.
It opened.
[ HINGES CREAKING ]
- Let's go.
- Come on.
It's open.
Where's the light switch?
Can we find some lights?
[ DOOR SLAMS ]
- Shit!
- Whoa.
- Find a light switch.
- Yeah.
[ CLICKING ]
The lights aren't working?
What, is the power out
or something?
I cannot see
anything remotely.
Just ask
and you shall receive, man.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Yes.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.
Slow down.
There's somethin'
I wanna do first.
We're here
to take down the set.
Let's take it down
so we can...
I know, dude. All right?
Let's just...
Come on, please.
This place is pretty different
at night, huh?
Ryan,
can we just get this done?
[ CLANGING ]
Yes!
Oh, ho, ho. Score!
[ CHUCKLES ]
Stage boy, man,
I told you not to mess with me.
But ya did.
And now, I got some good stuff
up my sleeve.
I have a couple options
of what I would like you to wear
at tomorrow night's play.
Here's option number one.
You know?
Little booby holes in there.
[ LAUGHS ]
Number two,
which is my personal favorite.
I hope you enjoy it as well.
[ LAUGHS ]
Ryan, stop messin' around.
Are you finished?
Yeah.
[ LOCKER DOOR SLAMS ]
Okay.
There's your sign, Cassidy.
- [ CHUCKLES ]
- Shh.
[ HINGES CREAKING ]
Yeah, this place
is super creepy at night.
What do you think, man?
Let's just take this thing down
and get outta here.
Copy that.
Charlie.
Charlie.
Come out and play.
[ GLASS SHATTERS ]
What?!
Cassidy,
what the hell are you doing?
What I thought
we came here to do.
[ GLASS SHATTERS ]
That's my girl!
All right.
I wanna get somethin'.
Yeah.
Felt good.
Lemme get another one.
- Get this one?
- Will you...
Want me to get this one?
[ CLATTERS ]
What's up? Huh?
Attaboy!
What is up?!
[ LAUGHS ]
You gotta like it.
Bring that light over here,
please.
Will you keep it lit?
Don't strip it, man.
Who gives a shit?
Are you gonna help me?
One down, bro.
Will you take
something apart, too?
I'm holdin' the light.
I know, but I'd like you
to take something apart.
That way,
I'm not doing this by myself.
"Help me take it apart."
The guy with no screwdriver.
Okay.
For you, sir.
Let's go, Shakespeare.
Come on, my man.
Let's hear some lines.
What?
Now or never.
Let's hear some lines.
What are you doing?
Get up here
and help me take this apart.
It was your idea.
[ HIGH-PITCHED VOICE ]
August. August?
I'm so frightened.
Just do it.
August, speak!
Please!
Don't worry, Mary.
He wants me.
He's coming for me.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?!
I'm doing the line.
Just say the...
Just say 'em better.
[ CHUCKLES ]
He wants me.
He is coming for me.
No one else.
Dost thou understand?
Thou shall be safe...
[ LOUD BANG ]
Whoa!
Get down here!
[ FOOTSTEPS RUNNING ]
Shit, cut the light!
Lose the tools, dude!
Lose the tools.
[ BREATHING HEAVILY ]
- Did you see anyone?
- No, I didn't see anybody.
No, but I heard them
over there!
- Is it that janitor? David?
- Who?
Who else would be in here?
What do we do?
Reese,
do you see anything?
Reese!
Okay,
let's go out the back.
- Now?
- Yes, right now.
Let's go.
- [ GASPS ]
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.
- Pfeifer?!
You're kidding me!
- Oh, my God.
- Pfeifer.
RYAN:
This is gonna be really good.
Reese?
CASSIDY: Oh, my gosh.
What are you guys
doing here?
RYAN: What...
What are you doing here?
I saw Reese's car.
Reese, I saw your car
in the parking lot.
I told you that we should've
parked somewhere else, dude.
- Yeah, no kidding.
- Can I please talk to you?
Yeah, yeah. Let's just talk
over here for a second.
- Ryan, let's go.
- Alone, please.
- Ryan.
- Fine.
- Fine!
- Reese.
What should I say?
I don't know.
Make something up.
I'm just gonna leave the light
right here for you guys.
Reese,
so what's goin' on?
What are you guys
doing here?
Uh... Well, we...
What... what if you guys
would've gotten caught?
What if it wasn't me
that caught you?
You wouldn't have been able
to do the show.
I know, I know. It's...
It's stupid.
I don't know what I was...
What we were thinking.
I'm sorry.
What are you guys
doing here?
Uh... You know, to...
- I was... - What?
We came to... to practice
a little bit.
You know?
To go over some of the lines
and stuff
because tomorrow's
the show...
And I don't...
Feel confident.
I don't... I don't
wanna let you down...
Pfeifer.
I really don't.
Okay.
Promise?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Okay? Okay.
Let's get outta here.
We shouldn't be here.
Let's go.
Oh, my God. Oh my God.
What are we gonna do?
Oh, it's so dark.
[ BEEP ]
Night vision app.
I know. I know.
Hit a little snag there
with drama queen coming in
and ruining the whole thing...
But smooth mcreese
is gonna walk us outta this
so we can we finish this up.
[ CLATTERING ]
Cassidy!
What are you doing?
Fixing the set, babe.
I mean,
we just took the set down!
What are you doing?
Yeah, but Pfeifer's here.
She knows.
She doesn't know.
Look.
Reese is out there
comin' up with some lame story.
Pfeifer's gonna leave.
This thing is practically
taken apart.
Reese will just call us
when he's done.
Okay, no. 'Cause Pfeifer's here and
she knows. And we can finish the job.
And look, I don't even have
any service on my cell phone.
All right.
That's weird,
but what do you expect
when you're on it 24/7?
Hey, Ryan.
Stop being dumb.
I'm not being dumb.
If you wanna leave,
go outside,
call Chelsea,
have her come get you.
And you can leave.
But I'm staying.
[ GROWLS ]
God.
This is so stupid.
It's not stupid, Ryan.
It's over. She knows.
It's not stupid.
You're stupid.
I told you
this was gonna happen.
I'm not stupid.
Yeah, but did I not say,
"Cassidy,
if you decide to come,
do not back out
because you get scared or..."
- I'm not backing out.
- You're clearly backing out!
Lookit!
Where am I going right now?
Right to the door...
[ HANDLE RATTLING ]
What the hell?
Funny. Okay?
This thing
isn't supposed to lock.
- Ryan.
- What?!
- Just open the frickin' door.
- Oh, just open the... okay.
Lemme give it another shot.
[ HANDLE RATTLING ]
I can't unlock it.
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ]
- Pfeifer. Gimme that.
- Excuse me.
Is there some kind of trick
to this door, Pfeifer?
No. There's not a trick.
Why isn't it opening?
- I don't know.
- You kidding me?
- Ryan, what'd you do?
- He doesn't have service either.
- I don't have service.
- Ry, he doesn't have it.
Guys, we shouldn't be
in this situation, okay?
- Just find another door.
- What happened to this door?
RYAN: I have no idea.
How does that not work?
We gotta go try
something else.
That should open this door.
[ KNOB RATTLING ]
They're barred.
What about the windows
in the classroom?
The classes are locked.
Cassidy, someone's locked
these doors, all right?
You guys are gonna get
in trouble. Not me.
This doesn't make any sense, dude.
Ryan, let's go.
- Cassidy, we're trying to go.
- Let's just get out, okay?!
Yeah, I wanna get out of here.
Thank you, Pfeifer.
- Do you, Ryan?
- Yes, I wanna go.
You still wanna finish the job?
You still wanna finish the job?
- You wanna finish it?
- Finish what job?
- What do you think about it now?
- Do not do that.
Do not what?
I don't care anymore.
We came to break up the set,
Pfeifer.
- We came to break up the set.
- Are you kidding me?
Reese, Ryan, and I all came here to
break up the set. Are you serious?
- What?
- What is your problem?
I don't have a problem.
I wanna get the hell out.
Cassidy.
- Why would you say that?
- We need to get out!
Pfeifer!
It was my idea, all right?
Pfeifer, please!
Will you listen?
Pfeifer!
Pfeifer, it was my...
Will you stop talking
for a second?
You've done enough.
- This play is an embarrassment!
- Shut up!
You're gonna embarrass
everybody!
This needs to stop.
What?
I took that noose down.
Reese, I took that down.
You saw me take it down, man.
The stairs?
CASSIDY: Can you guys
please stop messing with me?
- This isn't funny.
- We're not messing with you.
What did you guys do?
Shut up.
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- Stop, Pfeifer.
Practicing?
- You're such a liar.
- I'm sorr...
Reese,
what the hell is this?
Reese!
I know, I know.
What do we do?
We'll go to the office.
There's a phone there.
We'll call.
- Check this.
- Anything?
- This phone's dead.
- Where's the phone?
No, it's not working.
You're kidding me.
Anything that'll help us.
Keys.
I don't know.
Just look.
Have you found it?
Anything?
Go away.
You're making everything worse.
That hurts, man.
I'm sorry.

Tragedy struck bhs
last night
when Senior
Charlie Grimille died
in what is now being called
a freak accident.
A prop malfunctioned
during the school's
presentation of the Gallows.
[ STATIC ]
- Charlie.
- Shit.
Charlie.
...BHS say his spirit
will live on in the theater.
[ STATIC ]
Should've never ended
like this.
It's just not fair.
RYAN: That's that lady
from the theater.
She was the girlfriend.
Grimille died playing a role
he was never meant to play.
Charlie had originally
been cast as the Hangman.
...department and created
a handmade costume.
Charlie was supposed
to be the Hangman.
Hey, Charlie.
What happened?
Our leading man.
He called in sick.
He called in sick.
Charlie Grimille
was the understudy.
What about the Hangman,
though?
I guess there won't be one.
[ SCREAMING ]
[ STATIC ]
- Do it.
- Last one.
Here we go.
Three, two, one.
What? Do you see this?
Reese.
Reese, what did you see?
Who was it?

Did you see...
How do you get it back on?

Take the camera.
Take the camera.
Hold it, Cassidy!
Reese, what's wrong?
What are you doing?!
Reese, what?
Talk to us!
What the hell is he doing?
Reese!
Just let me see.
Can I? What is it?

You don't just take the light

I'm sorry!
I needed the light.
- Tell him
- what happened?!
- What are you doing, man?!
- It was my Dad, dude.
Charlie was supposed to be
the Hangman.
My Dad backed out.
That's why Charlie died.
Where the hell were you?!
- Give me the camera!
- Get out, Ryan!
RYAN: What, it was your Dad
that backed out?
It's important. The guy that
called in sick was my Dad.
- That's why Charlie died.

We need to figure this out.
What is happening?
I don't know, man.
What do you mean
you don't know?
I mean, what was that
with Cassidy?
The TV?
What was your Dad doing there?
- What is that about?
- Stop it.
What do you mean stop it?!
Cassidy's hurt!
And you haven't said anything!
Are you serious?!
Just don't put this on me,
man.
You're the reason that
we came here in the first place!
Yeah,
I'm the reason we're here,
but maybe you're the reason that
all this shit's happening to us!
- Don't even do that, okay?!
- Why not?!
- Because you brought me here!
- I brought you here to help you!
- I wanted to help you!
- You were not trying to help me!
You came here
to help yourself.
That is not true!
It was to help you!
And you're the reason
this is going bad!
We're stuck in here, man!
Why don't you tell us everything
that you know, Reese?!
Like how Charlie's dead
'cause your Dad didn't show up!
