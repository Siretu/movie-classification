1
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:22,550
3 billion human lives
ended on August 29th, 1997.

2
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,972
The survivors of the nuclear fire
called the war Judgment Day.

3
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:31,476
They lived only
to face a new nightmare,

4
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:33,936
the war against the machines.

5
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:54,976
The computer which
controlled the machines, Skynet,

6
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,521
sent two terminators
back through time.

7
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:02,650
Their mission: To destroy the leader
of the human resistance:

8
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:04,986
John Connor. My son.

9
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:12,618
The first terminator was programmed
to strike at me,

10
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,913
in the year 1984,
before John was born.

11
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:17,915
It failed.

12
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,169
The second was set to strike
at John himself,

13
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,296
when he was still a child.

14
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,346
As before, the Resistance
was able to send a lone warrior.

15
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:33,640
A protector for John.

16
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:36,768
It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.

17
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:54,567
I need your clothes, your boots,
and your motorcycle.

18
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:06,162
You forgot to say 'please'.

19
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:08,099
Take it.

20
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:37,628
You can't leave and take
the man's wheels, son.

21
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,922
Now get off before I put you down.

22
00:09:49,974 --> 00:09:51,476
That's it, goddammit!

23
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,747
Art 31 David show me code 6

24
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,458
at the 6th street bridge in Santa Fé

25
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,669
on an electrical disturbance.

26
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:01,671
10-4, 31 David.

27
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:42,063
John! Get in there
and clean up that pigsty of yours.

28
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,369
Your foster-parents
are kinda dicks, huh?

29
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,330
I swear I've had it
with that goddamn kid.

30
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:02,125
Won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move!

31
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:04,711
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

32
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:07,880
Todd.
- What?

33
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:11,467
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

34
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:15,179
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on, I'll get right on it.

35
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:27,358
John! Come on get your ass inside,
do what your mother tells you!

36
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:30,903
She's not my mother, Todd!

37
00:13:57,764 --> 00:14:02,185
This next patient is interesting.
Been following the case for years.

38
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:04,145
29-year-old female...

39
00:14:06,606 --> 00:14:09,400
...diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

40
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:14,238
Depression, anxiety, violent
acting-out, delusions of persecution.

41
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:24,040
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

42
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:27,377
She believes in a machine
called a "terminator",

43
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:31,673
which looks human of course, was
sent back through time to kill her.

44
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:33,049
That's original!

45
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:37,095
And also that the father of her child
was a soldier,

46
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:39,764
sent back to protect her.
- No.

47
00:14:40,056 --> 00:14:43,559
He was from the future too.
The year 2029,

48
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:46,104
if I remember correctly.

49
00:14:46,604 --> 00:14:47,855
Here we are.

50
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:50,066
Morning, Sarah.

51
00:14:54,362 --> 00:14:58,074
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

52
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,828
Fine, Sarah.

53
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:07,959
She stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.

54
00:15:09,377 --> 00:15:11,838
Repeated escape attempts.

55
00:15:21,222 --> 00:15:22,765
Let's move on, shall we?

56
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,011
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms.

57
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:30,389
See that she takes her Thorazine.
- I'll take care of it.

58
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:45,446
Time to take you meds, Connor.

59
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:47,949
You take it.

60
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:51,370
You gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

61
00:15:51,703 --> 00:15:53,373
I'm not taking it.

62
00:15:53,706 --> 00:15:56,751
I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble...

63
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:04,385
Yeah, zap her.

64
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:16,565
Last call, sugar.

65
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:24,158
Sweet dreams.

66
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:57,155
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

67
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,700
That's right.
What's he done now?

68
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:01,785
Could I speak with him, please?

69
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:03,245
Could if he was here.

70
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:06,333
He took off on his bike.
So he could be anywhere.

71
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,168
Do you have a photo of John?

72
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,753
Yeah, sure, hold on.

73
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,717
You gonna tell me
what this is about?

74
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:17,304
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

75
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:20,849
He's a good looking boy.

76
00:17:21,183 --> 00:17:23,686
Mind if I keep this picture?
- No, go on.

77
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:26,272
There was a guy here
looking for him too.

78
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:29,943
Big guy on a bike. Has that
got something to do with this?

79
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:35,825
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

80
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,329
Thanks for your cooperation.

81
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,460
Please insert your stolen card now!

82
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:52,803
PIN number...

83
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,349
Hurry up,
this is taking too long!

84
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,184
Go baby, go baby...

85
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,188
Alright! PIN number...

86
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,402
Who did you learn this from?
- My mom.

87
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:07,654
My real mom, I mean.

88
00:18:08,113 --> 00:18:12,410
Withdraw 300 bucks.
Come on, baby, come on...

89
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:16,664
It worked!

90
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,293
Easy money! Come on!

91
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:24,757
Yeah!
- Piece of cake!

92
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:31,473
That her?

93
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:33,142
Yes.

94
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,105
So she's pretty cool, huh?
- No, she's a complete psycho.

95
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,234
That's why she's up at Pescadero,
the mental institute.

96
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:44,322
Tried to blow up
the computer factory,

97
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:47,116
but got shot and arrested.
- Oh shit.

98
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:49,536
She's a total loser.

99
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:52,456
Come on,
let's go spend some money!

100
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:21,448
Sarah.

101
00:19:22,324 --> 00:19:23,618
Sarah, wake up.

102
00:19:31,752 --> 00:19:33,879
Kyle?

103
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,841
You're dead.

104
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,885
Where's our son, Sarah?

105
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,556
They took him away from me.

106
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,434
He's the target now.
- I know!

107
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,688
He's alone.
You have to protect him.

108
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,606
I know.

109
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,567
You tell me how I am supposed
to do that.

110
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,987
He doesn't even
believe me anymore.

111
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:57,323
I've lost him.

112
00:19:57,699 --> 00:19:59,283
You're strong, Sarah.

113
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:01,829
Stronger than you ever thought.
- No.

114
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,999
On your feet, soldier!

115
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,254
I love you. I always will.

116
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:14,260
I need you.
- I'll always be with you.

117
00:20:18,974 --> 00:20:20,851
Remember the message?

118
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:24,897
"The future is not set.

119
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,860
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves."

120
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:50,260
Stay with me.

121
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:54,098
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

122
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:03,275
Kyle, don't go!

123
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:17,041
Kyle!

124
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,463
It's like a giant strobe light,

125
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,215
burning right to my eyes.

126
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:42,433
Somehow I can still see.

127
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:49,649
Look,

128
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,700
we know the dream's the same
every night, why do we have to...

129
00:22:57,992 --> 00:22:59,827
Please continue.

130
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,961
The children look like burnt paper,

131
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:10,256
black,

132
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:12,384
not moving.

133
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:17,306
Then the blast wave hits them...

134
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:29,320
...and they fly apart like leaves.

135
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,619
Dreams about the end of the world
are very common, Sarah.

136
00:23:37,872 --> 00:23:40,625
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

137
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:46,173
I know the date it happens!
- I'm sure it feels real to you.

138
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:51,138
On August 29th, 1997 it's going to
feel pretty fucking real to you too!

139
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,641
Anybody not wearing
two million sunblock

140
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,311
is gonna have
a real bad day, get it?

141
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,648
God, you think
you're safe and alive.

142
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:05,446
You're already dead. Everybody,
him, you, you're dead already!

143
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:08,158
This place,
everything you see, is gone.

144
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,494
You're the one living
in a fucking dream, Silberman!

145
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:13,539
Because I know it happens.

146
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:14,832
It happens!

147
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:28,473
I feel much better now.

148
00:24:28,973 --> 00:24:30,683
Clearer.

149
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:35,397
Yes. Your attitude has been
much improved lately.

150
00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:47,536
It has helped to have a goal,

151
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,665
something to look forward to.

152
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,250
And what is that?

153
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:58,716
You said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

154
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:02,638
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

155
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,973
and I could have visitors.

156
00:25:07,394 --> 00:25:09,562
Well, it's been six months.

157
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:13,317
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

158
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:15,611
I see.

159
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:21,535
Let's go back
to what you were saying

160
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:23,870
about those terminator machines.

161
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:26,707
Now you think they don't exist?

162
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:31,588
They don't exist.
I know that now.

163
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:34,341
But you've told me
on many occasions

164
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,721
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

165
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:41,891
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

166
00:25:42,183 --> 00:25:44,729
They would've found
something at the factory.

167
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,355
I see.

168
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:50,527
So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?

169
00:25:52,904 --> 00:25:55,157
No, why would they?

170
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:59,036
Let's try a new position.
Right, there.

171
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,624
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

172
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,586
The neurons are all centered.

173
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:08,381
Maybe the inhibitors failed.

174
00:26:08,757 --> 00:26:10,467
Mr. Dyson?

175
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:14,180
The materials team...

176
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:20,729
...is running another series
this afternoon, and you have to...

177
00:26:21,021 --> 00:26:23,690
You have to sign it out.

178
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,359
Come on. I'll get it.

179
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:31,408
I know I haven't been here that long,
but I was wondering if you know...

180
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,701
Know what?

181
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:35,662
Well if you know,
where it came from.

182
00:26:35,954 --> 00:26:38,833
I asked the same question once.
Know what they told me?

183
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,210
"Don't ask."

184
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:49,679
Hello, Mr. Dyson. - How's it going?
- Okay.

185
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,890
Insert key.

186
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:54,976
Left and three, two, one, turn.

187
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,192
How are wife and kids?
- Great, thanks.

188
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:31,854
So what do you think, Doctor?

189
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,773
I've shown improvement,
haven't I?

190
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,903
Well, Sarah, here's the problem:

191
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:41,865
I know how smart you are.

192
00:27:42,824 --> 00:27:45,327
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

193
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:48,330
I don't think you believe
what you're telling me.

194
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:52,419
If I put you in minimum security
you'll just try to escape again.

195
00:27:57,633 --> 00:28:02,556
You have to let me see my son.
Please.

196
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,976
Please.

197
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,898
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

198
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:16,322
If I could just make a phone call.
- I'm afraid not. Not for a while.

199
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,910
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board

200
00:28:20,202 --> 00:28:22,329
that you stay here
for another six months.

201
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:28,086
You son of a bitch!

202
00:28:37,387 --> 00:28:40,892
You don't know what you're doing!
- Straighten her now!

203
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:45,439
You don't know what you're doing!

204
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:51,696
Model citizen.

205
00:29:31,284 --> 00:29:33,954
You just missed him.
He left fifteen minutes ago.

206
00:29:34,246 --> 00:29:36,999
I think he said he was going to
the Galleria. - Yeah.

207
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,751
The Galleria?

208
00:30:24,846 --> 00:30:27,475
I'll get some quarters.
I'll be back, alright?

209
00:30:43,827 --> 00:30:46,247
Girls, do you know John Connor?
- No.

210
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:51,044
You know this guy?

211
00:30:52,087 --> 00:30:53,713
No, I don't know him.

212
00:30:59,428 --> 00:31:00,847
John.
- Not now.

213
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:04,810
There's this cop scoping for you,
check it out.

214
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:11,109
Split, man, just go.
- Yeah.

215
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:18,826
I think I saw the kid
you're looking for.

216
00:31:33,302 --> 00:31:34,970
You're not supposed to be here!

217
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:01,918
Get down!

218
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:33,609
Come on!

219
00:34:14,197 --> 00:34:15,198
Goddamn!

220
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:57,110
Okay, time out. Stop the bike!

221
00:38:57,694 --> 00:38:59,197
Come on, stop the bike.

222
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:17,218
Don't take this the wrong way,
you're a terminator, right?

223
00:39:17,509 --> 00:39:20,554
Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

224
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,449
Holy shit! You're really real!

225
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:47,545
You're like a machine underneath,
but sort of alive outside?

226
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:49,630
I'm a cybernetic organism.

227
00:39:49,922 --> 00:39:52,258
Living tissue
over a metal endoskeleton.

228
00:40:07,526 --> 00:40:08,902
This is intense.

229
00:40:09,862 --> 00:40:11,197
Get a grip, John.

230
00:40:15,285 --> 00:40:18,998
You're not here to kill me.
I figured that out for myself.

231
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,749
So what's the deal?

232
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,795
My mission is to protect you.

233
00:40:24,212 --> 00:40:26,756
Yeah? Who sent you?

234
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:28,884
You did.

235
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,470
35 years from now
you reprogrammed me

236
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,973
to be your protector here,
in this time.

237
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,351
This is deep.

238
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:01,964
This other guy,
he's a terminator like you, right?

239
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,508
Not like me. A T-1000.

240
00:41:04,884 --> 00:41:07,179
Advanced prototype.

241
00:41:07,638 --> 00:41:09,640
You mean more advanced
than you are?

242
00:41:09,932 --> 00:41:12,227
Yes. A mimetic polyalloy.

243
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:13,895
What does that mean?

244
00:41:14,312 --> 00:41:15,480
Liquid metal.

245
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:20,694
Where are we going?
- We have to get out of the city.

246
00:41:20,986 --> 00:41:22,905
And avoid the authorities.

247
00:41:23,198 --> 00:41:26,368
I gotta stop by my house
and pick up some stuff. - Negative.

248
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,830
The T-1000 will definitely
try to reacquire you there.

249
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:32,124
You sure?
- I would.

250
00:41:43,304 --> 00:41:46,182
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks

251
00:41:47,935 --> 00:41:49,478
but I gotta warn them.

252
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,147
Shit! You got a quarter?

253
00:42:00,616 --> 00:42:01,617
Hello?

254
00:42:01,993 --> 00:42:03,077
Janelle? It's me.

255
00:42:03,703 --> 00:42:05,414
John?
- Yeah.

256
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:07,833
Is everything alright?
- Sure.

257
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,460
Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

258
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,842
John, it's late. I was
beginning to worry about you.

259
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:19,847
If you hurry, we can have dinner
together. I'm making beef stew.

260
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,391
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

261
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:24,936
Where are you?

262
00:42:25,395 --> 00:42:27,689
What's the goddamn dog
barking at?

263
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:29,357
Shut up,

264
00:42:29,817 --> 00:42:31,068
you piece of shit!

265
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,528
The dog's barking.

266
00:42:32,904 --> 00:42:34,655
Tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

267
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,537
Honey, it's late.

268
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:43,207
Could it already be there?

269
00:42:44,584 --> 00:42:45,585
Are you okay?

270
00:42:45,919 --> 00:42:49,632
I'm right here. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

271
00:42:50,507 --> 00:42:52,885
What's the dog's name?
- Max.

272
00:42:53,803 --> 00:42:55,972
Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfy?

273
00:42:56,264 --> 00:42:58,350
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

274
00:42:58,725 --> 00:43:01,145
Wolfy's fine, honey.

275
00:43:02,688 --> 00:43:03,689
Where are you?

276
00:43:06,026 --> 00:43:07,903
Your foster-parents are dead.

277
00:43:45,488 --> 00:43:46,781
I need a minute here.

278
00:43:47,073 --> 00:43:51,161
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

279
00:43:51,453 --> 00:43:54,583
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

280
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:56,001
Can't be real!

281
00:43:56,293 --> 00:43:59,212
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

282
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:01,173
Only objects of equal size.

283
00:44:01,507 --> 00:44:03,759
Why not a bomb
or something to get me?

284
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:07,806
It can't form complex machines.
Guns, explosives have chemicals,

285
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:10,183
moving parts.
It doesn't work that way.

286
00:44:10,475 --> 00:44:12,353
But it can form solid metal shapes.

287
00:44:12,645 --> 00:44:15,064
Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

288
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:48,479
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

289
00:44:48,771 --> 00:44:51,565
at the West Highland police station
in 1984.

290
00:44:53,234 --> 00:44:56,029
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

291
00:44:57,906 --> 00:44:59,699
Men with families.

292
00:45:01,494 --> 00:45:02,912
Children.

293
00:45:04,372 --> 00:45:08,210
These were taken
at a mall in Reseda. Today.

294
00:45:10,295 --> 00:45:13,549
Ms Connor, we know
you know who this guy is.

295
00:45:16,344 --> 00:45:19,723
Look, I just sat here
and told you your son is missing,

296
00:45:20,432 --> 00:45:23,018
that the foster-parents
have been murdered.

297
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:24,896
We know this guy's involved.

298
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:29,901
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

299
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:35,700
We're wasting our time.

300
00:45:36,743 --> 00:45:38,287
Let's go.

301
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:42,792
Sorry, guys. She's just grown
more and more disconnected

302
00:45:43,084 --> 00:45:44,877
from reality as time goes on.

303
00:45:45,378 --> 00:45:47,630
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

304
00:45:48,214 --> 00:45:52,303
If she clears at all and can give us
anything, I'll call you. - Sure.

305
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:56,474
Douglas, take her
back to her room, please. - Yes, sir.

306
00:45:58,435 --> 00:46:00,061
Come on, let's go.

307
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:06,193
We spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

308
00:46:07,696 --> 00:46:11,325
For a while she was
with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy,

309
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,827
running guns.

310
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,413
Then there were some other guys.

311
00:46:15,914 --> 00:46:18,542
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from,

312
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:22,087
so she could teach me
how to be this great military leader.

313
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,759
Then she gets busted and it's like:

314
00:46:26,092 --> 00:46:29,179
"Sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.
Didn't you know?"

315
00:46:31,015 --> 00:46:34,644
Everything I've been brought up
to believe is all bullshit.

316
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,147
I hated her for that.

317
00:46:40,943 --> 00:46:44,364
But everything she said was true.

318
00:46:44,864 --> 00:46:46,366
She knew.

319
00:46:48,827 --> 00:46:51,080
And nobody believed her.

320
00:46:52,581 --> 00:46:54,458
Not even me.

321
00:46:57,128 --> 00:46:59,339
We gotta get her out of there.
- Negative.

322
00:46:59,631 --> 00:47:02,343
The T-1000's highest
probability for success will be

323
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:04,971
to copy her and wait
for you to make contact.

324
00:47:05,263 --> 00:47:07,057
Great. What happens to her?

325
00:47:07,432 --> 00:47:10,018
The subject being copied
is terminated.

326
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,562
Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go now!

327
00:47:13,022 --> 00:47:15,108
Negative.
It's not a priority.

328
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,860
Fuck you,
she's a priority to me!

329
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:22,032
Goddammit!
What's your problem?

330
00:47:23,075 --> 00:47:25,495
Help!
- This does not help our mission!

331
00:47:25,954 --> 00:47:31,127
Help me! Get this psycho off of me.

332
00:47:31,419 --> 00:47:32,420
Let me go!

333
00:47:37,175 --> 00:47:38,635
Why did you do that?

334
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:40,554
Because you told me to.

335
00:47:43,891 --> 00:47:45,184
What?

336
00:47:50,274 --> 00:47:51,900
You have to do what I say?

337
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:54,361
One of my mission parameters.

338
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,948
Prove it.

339
00:47:57,782 --> 00:47:58,992
Stand on one foot.

340
00:48:05,207 --> 00:48:07,502
Cool! My own terminator.

341
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:11,089
You okay, kid?

342
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:12,549
Take a hike, bozo.

343
00:48:13,593 --> 00:48:15,345
Let's get out of here.
- What?

344
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,180
Fuck you, little dipshit.

345
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:20,059
Dipshit?

346
00:48:21,852 --> 00:48:23,020
Put your leg down.

347
00:48:24,146 --> 00:48:27,233
Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?

348
00:48:27,525 --> 00:48:29,069
Just trying to help this punk.

349
00:48:29,361 --> 00:48:30,988
Grab this guy.

350
00:48:34,575 --> 00:48:37,496
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douchebag?

351
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,051
Put the gun down! Now!

352
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:50,928
Get out of here!

353
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,888
Come on, let's split!

354
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:01,607
You were gonna kill that guy!

355
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:03,818
Of course. I'm a terminator.

356
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:08,448
Listen to me carefully, okay?

357
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:11,702
You're not
a terminator anymore. Alright?

358
00:49:13,204 --> 00:49:14,205
You got that?

359
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:17,917
You just can't go round
killing people! - Why?

360
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:21,171
What do you mean "why"?
'Cause you can't!

361
00:49:21,547 --> 00:49:24,383
Why?
- Because you just can't, okay?

362
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:26,511
Trust me on this.

363
00:49:31,684 --> 00:49:34,687
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

364
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:37,983
And I order you to help me.

365
00:52:05,446 --> 00:52:09,201
You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running kind of late.

366
00:52:09,743 --> 00:52:14,374
They've been in there for an hour.
Hold on a second, I'll buzz you in.

367
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:19,212
Oh, here come your friends now.

368
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:24,872
Hey Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

369
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:28,251
How about a beer?
- Yeah, right.

370
00:53:53,322 --> 00:53:55,282
I got a Full House.
- That's good.

371
00:53:55,824 --> 00:53:57,702
Must be my lucky day.

372
00:56:21,036 --> 00:56:23,497
Yeah, I think you're right
about number 24.

373
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:26,333
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

374
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:28,586
Same time?
- Yeah.

375
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:50,570
You broke my arm!

376
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,034
There's 215 bones
in the human body. That's one.

377
00:56:55,576 --> 00:56:56,744
Now don't move!

378
00:57:02,542 --> 00:57:03,919
What are you gonna do?

379
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,342
Why do we stop now?

380
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:14,431
You gotta promise
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

381
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,768
Right.
- Swear.

382
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:18,394
What?

383
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:22,900
Just put up your hand and say
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

384
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:27,029
I swear I will not kill anyone.
- Alright, let's go.

385
00:57:34,622 --> 00:57:38,417
Visiting hours is 10 to 4.
Monday through Friday.

386
00:57:42,339 --> 00:57:43,340
What are you doing?

387
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:46,010
You son of a bitch! You shot me!

388
00:57:59,693 --> 00:58:00,694
He'll live.

389
00:58:16,546 --> 00:58:17,547
Son of a bitch!

390
00:58:19,674 --> 00:58:22,761
Let's all try to remain calm.
- Open it or he'll be dead!

391
00:58:23,053 --> 00:58:25,139
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

392
00:58:25,431 --> 00:58:27,433
Open the door!
- It ain't gonna happen.

393
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:29,060
Take it easy, Sarah.

394
00:58:29,728 --> 00:58:31,980
It won't work, Sarah.
You're no killer.

395
00:58:32,272 --> 00:58:34,150
You're already dead, Silberman.

396
00:58:34,483 --> 00:58:37,403
Everybody here dies.
So don't fuck with me!

397
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:39,447
Open the door.

398
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:48,082
Back off!

399
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:51,461
Get back or I'll pump him
full of this shit, I swear!

400
00:58:53,672 --> 00:58:54,673
Don't move!

401
00:58:56,216 --> 00:58:57,217
Drop the shit!

402
00:58:57,594 --> 00:58:58,762
Do it! Do it!

403
00:59:00,138 --> 00:59:01,389
Get in the office!

404
00:59:01,681 --> 00:59:03,516
On the floor! Face down! Not you!

405
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:05,144
Open the door!

406
00:59:08,189 --> 00:59:10,859
On the floor! Hold it open!
Face the wall!

407
00:59:27,879 --> 00:59:29,047
Get her!

408
01:00:01,376 --> 01:00:02,877
Come on, open it!

409
01:00:03,211 --> 01:00:04,213
Come on!

410
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:07,341
She just broke it off.
- Open it.

411
01:00:13,348 --> 01:00:16,144
Let's go around, come on!
Move it!

412
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:41,631
No!

413
01:00:42,215 --> 01:00:43,258
No!

414
01:00:47,305 --> 01:00:48,306
Mom! Wait!

415
01:00:57,232 --> 01:00:58,234
No!

416
01:01:01,029 --> 01:01:02,405
Help her.
- Wait here.

417
01:01:03,531 --> 01:01:05,284
He'll kill us all!

418
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:10,499
He'll kill us all!

419
01:01:32,565 --> 01:01:34,944
Mom, are you okay?

420
01:01:39,698 --> 01:01:41,785
Come with me,
if you want to live.

421
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:44,871
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

422
01:02:09,483 --> 01:02:10,944
Go!

423
01:02:42,898 --> 01:02:44,983
What the fuck is going on?

424
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,919
Get down!

425
01:03:38,087 --> 01:03:39,171
Out of the car!

426
01:03:40,841 --> 01:03:41,842
Right now!

427
01:04:18,801 --> 01:04:19,802
I'm out.

428
01:04:26,685 --> 01:04:28,312
Come on!
- Here.

429
01:04:31,357 --> 01:04:32,358
Reload!

430
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:43,622
Next one.

431
01:04:51,464 --> 01:04:52,465
Hang on!

432
01:05:19,205 --> 01:05:20,498
Ready!

433
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,183
Here, drive!

434
01:06:29,704 --> 01:06:31,915
There's nobody behind us.

435
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,708
Are you alright?
- Yeah.

436
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,005
Can you even see anything?

437
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,548
I see everything.

438
01:06:42,761 --> 01:06:43,762
Cool.

439
01:06:48,142 --> 01:06:49,143
Come here.

440
01:06:55,609 --> 01:06:57,361
I said I was okay.

441
01:06:58,445 --> 01:07:01,032
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

442
01:07:02,575 --> 01:07:04,577
You have to
be smarter than that.

443
01:07:04,953 --> 01:07:09,041
You almost got yourself killed.
What were you thinking?

444
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:14,256
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me, do you understand?

445
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:15,674
You're too important!

446
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:18,094
You understand?

447
01:07:24,643 --> 01:07:27,813
I had to get you
out of that place. I'm sorry.

448
01:07:29,398 --> 01:07:32,902
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

449
01:07:38,909 --> 01:07:41,370
What's wrong with your eyes?

450
01:07:42,456 --> 01:07:43,457
Nothing.

451
01:07:54,178 --> 01:07:55,637
So what's your story?

452
01:08:07,067 --> 01:08:09,320
You okay?
- Fine.

453
01:08:11,322 --> 01:08:14,326
Say, that's a nice bike.

454
01:08:36,727 --> 01:08:38,521
Hey, watch it, lug nuts.

455
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:49,826
Listen,
you know what you are doing?

456
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,410
I have detailed files

457
01:08:51,702 --> 01:08:54,915
on human anatomy.
- I bet.

458
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:59,503
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right? - Correct.

459
01:09:06,052 --> 01:09:07,638
Does it hurt when you get shot?

460
01:09:09,765 --> 01:09:13,645
I sense injuries. The data
could be called pain.

461
01:09:14,563 --> 01:09:16,481
John, help me with the light.

462
01:09:16,857 --> 01:09:18,901
Will these heal up?
- Yes.

463
01:09:19,193 --> 01:09:23,072
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

464
01:09:23,364 --> 01:09:26,618
How long do you live,
I mean "last", whatever?

465
01:09:26,952 --> 01:09:29,204
120 years with
my existing power cell.

466
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:32,625
Can you learn stuff you
haven't been programmed with?

467
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:37,548
So you can be...
you know, more human?

468
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,925
Not such a dork all the time?

469
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:47,517
My CPU is a neural-net processor,
a learning computer,

470
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:51,481
that Skynet presets to READ
only when we are sent out alone.

471
01:09:53,191 --> 01:09:55,819
Doesn't want you
to do too much thinking.

472
01:09:56,111 --> 01:09:57,112
No.

473
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,450
Can we reset the switch?

474
01:10:19,096 --> 01:10:23,226
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

475
01:10:29,274 --> 01:10:30,359
Do it.

476
01:10:38,661 --> 01:10:40,788
Now open the port cover.

477
01:10:44,084 --> 01:10:47,170
Pull to break the seal.

478
01:10:50,091 --> 01:10:54,178
Good, now remove
the shock damping assembly.

479
01:10:57,266 --> 01:10:59,601
You can now access the CPU.

480
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:02,522
Do you see it?
- Yes.

481
01:11:02,897 --> 01:11:05,275
Pull the CPU by its base tap.

482
01:11:06,986 --> 01:11:07,987
Pull.

483
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,282
Can you see the pin switch?

484
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:49,076
No!

485
01:11:50,328 --> 01:11:52,747
Out of my way, John!
- Don't kill him!

486
01:11:53,873 --> 01:11:55,959
"It", John, not "him".

487
01:11:56,251 --> 01:11:59,713
Okay, "it". But we need "it".

488
01:12:00,088 --> 01:12:02,509
Listen to me. Listen.

489
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,677
We're better off on our own.

490
01:12:05,053 --> 01:12:08,015
He's the only proof of
the future, the war and that.

491
01:12:09,475 --> 01:12:10,476
Maybe.

492
01:12:13,605 --> 01:12:15,065
I don't trust it.

493
01:12:15,524 --> 01:12:17,901
But he's my friend, alright?

494
01:12:18,193 --> 01:12:20,821
You don't know what it's like
to kill these things.

495
01:12:21,113 --> 01:12:24,158
If something goes wrong,
this could be our last chance.

496
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:26,954
If I'm supposed to
be this military leader,

497
01:12:27,246 --> 01:12:30,332
maybe you start listening
to my ideas once in a while.

498
01:12:33,711 --> 01:12:37,424
'Cause if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

499
01:12:52,733 --> 01:12:55,237
Alright, play it your way.

500
01:13:02,871 --> 01:13:04,497
Was there a problem?

501
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,166
No problem.

502
01:13:08,252 --> 01:13:09,253
None whatsoever.

503
01:13:43,376 --> 01:13:45,962
Are we learning yet?

504
01:13:57,518 --> 01:14:01,021
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

505
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,028
Just head south.

506
01:14:14,704 --> 01:14:17,582
Keep it under 65.
We don't want to be pulled over.

507
01:14:17,874 --> 01:14:18,959
Affirmative.

508
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:21,587
No, no, no.

509
01:14:22,255 --> 01:14:24,590
You got to listen to
the way people talk.

510
01:14:24,924 --> 01:14:28,470
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

511
01:14:28,804 --> 01:14:30,681
You say "No problemo".

512
01:14:31,223 --> 01:14:34,686
If someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say "Eat me".

513
01:14:35,061 --> 01:14:39,024
And if you want to shine them
on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".

514
01:14:39,984 --> 01:14:42,236
Hasta la vista, baby.

515
01:14:42,903 --> 01:14:44,406
Or "Later, dickwad".

516
01:14:44,698 --> 01:14:47,534
If someone gets upset
you say "Chill out".

517
01:14:47,826 --> 01:14:48,994
Or do combinations.

518
01:14:49,871 --> 01:14:52,039
Chill out, dickwad.

519
01:14:53,332 --> 01:14:54,750
You're getting it.

520
01:14:55,543 --> 01:14:56,837
No problemo.

521
01:15:07,892 --> 01:15:11,061
You got any cash?
- I got a couple of hundred bucks.

522
01:15:11,437 --> 01:15:12,605
I'll give you half.

523
01:15:13,147 --> 01:15:14,149
Mom!

524
01:15:15,942 --> 01:15:17,444
Get some food.

525
01:15:19,906 --> 01:15:21,657
No sense of humor.

526
01:15:27,706 --> 01:15:29,333
And that's another thing:

527
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:30,918
Lighten up a bit.

528
01:15:32,212 --> 01:15:36,257
This severe routine is getting old.
You're acting like such a geek.

529
01:15:36,549 --> 01:15:37,968
Smile once in a while.

530
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,553
Smile?

531
01:15:39,929 --> 01:15:42,264
Yeah. You know, smile.

532
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,641
Watch.

533
01:15:45,143 --> 01:15:48,188
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

534
01:15:49,397 --> 01:15:50,816
Gimme a break.

535
01:15:52,276 --> 01:15:54,820
Okay. Bad example.

536
01:15:55,863 --> 01:15:58,659
See that guy over there?
That's a smile.

537
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:19,975
That's good.

538
01:16:20,268 --> 01:16:23,354
You could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

539
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:32,365
Want some of my fries?

540
01:16:42,167 --> 01:16:43,627
Do you need any help?

541
01:16:44,003 --> 01:16:45,005
No.

542
01:16:45,797 --> 01:16:47,257
Got you!
- No, you didn't!

543
01:16:47,757 --> 01:16:48,967
Got you!
- You didn't!

544
01:16:55,933 --> 01:16:58,812
We're not gonna make it, are we?

545
01:17:00,939 --> 01:17:03,192
People, I mean.

546
01:17:05,445 --> 01:17:08,574
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

547
01:17:08,866 --> 01:17:11,493
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

548
01:17:16,374 --> 01:17:18,627
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

549
01:17:19,586 --> 01:17:21,005
Who's responsible?

550
01:17:21,297 --> 01:17:24,133
The man responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

551
01:17:25,176 --> 01:17:26,386
Who is that?

552
01:17:26,678 --> 01:17:30,766
The director of special projects at
Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

553
01:17:33,144 --> 01:17:34,270
Why him?

554
01:17:35,021 --> 01:17:38,984
In a few months he creates a
revolutionary microprocessor.

555
01:17:39,276 --> 01:17:40,319
Go on. Then what?

556
01:17:41,862 --> 01:17:45,075
In three years Cyberdyne
will become the largest supplier

557
01:17:45,367 --> 01:17:47,077
of military computer systems.

558
01:17:47,369 --> 01:17:50,581
Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers.

559
01:17:50,873 --> 01:17:51,958
Becoming unmanned,

560
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,669
they fly
with a perfect operational record.

561
01:17:55,586 --> 01:17:57,464
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

562
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:00,592
The system goes on-line
on August 4th, 1997.

563
01:18:00,884 --> 01:18:04,180
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

564
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:06,808
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

565
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:11,021
It becomes self-aware at 2: 14 a.m.
Eastern time, August 29.

566
01:18:12,314 --> 01:18:15,694
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

567
01:18:16,194 --> 01:18:17,946
Skynet fights back.

568
01:18:18,488 --> 01:18:21,951
Yes. It launches its missiles
against targets in Russia.

569
01:18:22,243 --> 01:18:24,036
Why Russia?
They're our friends now.

570
01:18:24,412 --> 01:18:27,583
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

571
01:18:27,874 --> 01:18:30,502
will eliminate its enemies here.
- Jesus.

572
01:18:33,548 --> 01:18:36,384
How much do you know
about Dyson?

573
01:18:37,385 --> 01:18:40,055
I have detailed files.

574
01:18:40,347 --> 01:18:42,725
I want to know everything.

575
01:18:43,392 --> 01:18:47,063
What he looks like.
Where he lives. Everything.

576
01:18:59,494 --> 01:19:00,704
Miles!

577
01:19:22,939 --> 01:19:26,150
You going to work all day?
- I'm sorry, baby.

578
01:19:26,525 --> 01:19:28,362
This thing
is kicking my ass.

579
01:19:28,737 --> 01:19:32,574
It's Sunday. You promised to take
the kids to Raging Waters today.

580
01:19:34,535 --> 01:19:37,705
I can't. I'm on a roll.

581
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:54,809
This is gonna blow 'em away.
It's a neural-net processor.

582
01:19:55,101 --> 01:19:56,519
I know. You told me.

583
01:19:56,811 --> 01:19:59,523
It thinks and learns like we do.

584
01:19:59,898 --> 01:20:02,401
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

585
01:20:02,693 --> 01:20:06,614
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

586
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:10,578
Why is that so important?

587
01:20:10,869 --> 01:20:13,289
I need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like

588
01:20:13,664 --> 01:20:15,875
I'm going crazy here.

589
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,337
Baby, I am this close.

590
01:20:20,422 --> 01:20:21,424
Come here.

591
01:20:23,801 --> 01:20:27,598
Imagine a jet airliner
with a pilot that never gets tired,

592
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:31,018
never makes mistakes,
never shows up with a hangover.

593
01:20:33,563 --> 01:20:35,356
Meet the pilot.

594
01:20:35,982 --> 01:20:40,112
Why did we get married?
Have children? You don't need us.

595
01:20:40,654 --> 01:20:44,033
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

596
01:20:44,408 --> 01:20:46,536
But it doesn't love you like we do.

597
01:20:55,004 --> 01:20:57,382
I'm sorry. Really.

598
01:20:57,925 --> 01:21:01,720
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

599
01:21:04,724 --> 01:21:06,809
Raging Waters?
- Yeah!

600
01:21:36,386 --> 01:21:38,012
Wait in the car.

601
01:21:56,909 --> 01:21:58,495
Enrique?

602
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:00,580
You here?

603
01:22:16,308 --> 01:22:17,767
Pretty jumpy, Connor.

604
01:22:19,769 --> 01:22:20,770
What about you?

605
01:22:24,025 --> 01:22:25,985
Always on the lurk.

606
01:22:28,488 --> 01:22:31,575
Good to see you, Connor.
- I promised to make it back.

607
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:34,245
Man, I knew it.
Good to see you.

608
01:22:34,746 --> 01:22:38,916
Yolanda. Get out here, we got
company. And bring some tequila!

609
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:40,419
Oye, Big John?

610
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:42,046
Que pasa?
- What's up?

611
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:44,590
Who's your friend?
- He's cool.

612
01:22:44,965 --> 01:22:49,137
He's with me. He is Uncle Bob.

613
01:22:49,512 --> 01:22:51,181
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

614
01:22:51,682 --> 01:22:53,601
Uncle Bob, huh?

615
01:22:54,685 --> 01:22:56,020
Okay.

616
01:22:58,023 --> 01:22:59,066
How are you?

617
01:22:59,358 --> 01:23:01,652
How are you? You've gotten big.

618
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:04,489
Drink?

619
01:23:09,118 --> 01:23:10,120
Uncle Bob?

620
01:23:11,747 --> 01:23:13,582
Sarahlita, you pretty famous.

621
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:17,629
All over the TV. Pictures of
you, John, your big friend here.

622
01:23:18,129 --> 01:23:20,382
Cops are going nuts looking for you.

623
01:23:21,341 --> 01:23:23,469
Take the kid, honey, will you?

624
01:23:23,844 --> 01:23:25,388
I just came for my stuff.

625
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,350
I need clothes, food,
and one of your trucks.

626
01:23:28,725 --> 01:23:31,937
How about the fillings out of
my fucking teeth? - Now.

627
01:23:33,856 --> 01:23:37,318
You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on, let's go.

628
01:23:58,427 --> 01:24:00,762
One thing about my mom,

629
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:04,767
she always plans ahead.

630
01:24:15,112 --> 01:24:16,114
Excellent.

631
01:24:20,952 --> 01:24:22,163
Nothing down here.

632
01:24:27,126 --> 01:24:30,839
This is the best truck I got,
but the starter is gone.

633
01:24:31,131 --> 01:24:33,467
You got the time to change it out?
- Yeah.

634
01:24:33,759 --> 01:24:36,304
I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

635
01:24:36,596 --> 01:24:39,557
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.

636
01:24:39,891 --> 01:24:42,478
You get out tonight too, okay?
- Sure.

637
01:24:44,021 --> 01:24:47,359
Just drop by any time
and totally fuck up my life.

638
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:55,701
See, I grew up in places like this,

639
01:24:56,077 --> 01:24:58,705
so I thought
that's how people lived:

640
01:24:59,414 --> 01:25:02,626
Riding around in helicopters,

641
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:05,254
learning how to blow shit up.

642
01:25:07,131 --> 01:25:11,845
But then, when my mom got busted,
I got put in a regular school.

643
01:25:12,513 --> 01:25:15,683
The other kids were into Nintendo.

644
01:25:30,033 --> 01:25:31,785
Are you ever afraid?

645
01:25:32,077 --> 01:25:33,328
No.

646
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:38,584
Not even of dying?

647
01:25:39,919 --> 01:25:40,963
No.

648
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:49,889
You don't feel any emotion about it
one way or another?

649
01:25:50,181 --> 01:25:52,768
No.
I have to stay functional

650
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:55,062
until the mission is complete.

651
01:25:59,693 --> 01:26:01,611
Then it doesn't matter.

652
01:26:02,154 --> 01:26:05,658
Yeah. I have to stay functional too.
I'm "too important".

653
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:23,888
That's definitely you.

654
01:26:35,276 --> 01:26:38,071
Most of the guys my mom
hung round with were geeks.

655
01:26:38,655 --> 01:26:41,283
But there was this one guy.
He was kinda cool.

656
01:26:41,825 --> 01:26:44,161
He taught me engines.

657
01:26:44,453 --> 01:26:45,788
Hold here.

658
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,667
Mom screwed it up, of course.

659
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:51,920
She'd always tell
them about Judgment Day

660
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:54,256
and me being this world leader.

661
01:26:54,548 --> 01:26:57,051
And that'll be all she wrote.

662
01:26:57,426 --> 01:27:01,848
Torque wrench, please.
- Here.

663
01:27:02,516 --> 01:27:05,645
I wish I could've met my real dad.

664
01:27:05,937 --> 01:27:07,188
You will.

665
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,065
Yeah. I guess.

666
01:27:09,482 --> 01:27:11,902
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

667
01:27:13,904 --> 01:27:17,117
I'll send him back
through time to 1984.

668
01:27:20,328 --> 01:27:22,747
He hasn't even been born yet.

669
01:27:24,709 --> 01:27:27,169
It messes with your head.

670
01:27:29,047 --> 01:27:30,757
The other bolt.

671
01:27:31,508 --> 01:27:32,509
Here.

672
01:27:39,517 --> 01:27:42,062
Mom and him
were only together one night.

673
01:27:42,396 --> 01:27:44,732
She still loves him, I guess.

674
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:47,277
I see her crying sometimes.

675
01:27:47,569 --> 01:27:49,571
She denies it totally, of course.

676
01:27:49,863 --> 01:27:52,490
Like she got something
stuck in her eye.

677
01:27:56,495 --> 01:27:57,788
Why do you cry?

678
01:27:59,124 --> 01:28:00,709
You mean people?
- Yeah.

679
01:28:01,084 --> 01:28:02,294
I don't know.

680
01:28:02,586 --> 01:28:04,296
We just cry, you know.

681
01:28:04,838 --> 01:28:06,674
When it hurts.

682
01:28:13,098 --> 01:28:14,808
Pain causes it?

683
01:28:15,267 --> 01:28:17,687
No, it's different.

684
01:28:17,979 --> 01:28:21,483
It's when there's nothing wrong
but you hurt anyway.

685
01:28:21,816 --> 01:28:22,942
You get it?
- No.

686
01:28:24,737 --> 01:28:25,738
Alright! My man!

687
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:27,531
No problemo.

688
01:28:27,865 --> 01:28:28,866
Gimme five.

689
01:28:31,536 --> 01:28:33,830
Put out your hand like this.
Come on.

690
01:28:35,249 --> 01:28:36,751
Alright. Now hit me.

691
01:28:37,043 --> 01:28:40,713
Gimme five. Do the same thing.
- Alright!

692
01:28:44,051 --> 01:28:46,220
Okay, that's good.
Up high, up high.

693
01:28:47,472 --> 01:28:48,473
Five low.

694
01:28:49,182 --> 01:28:50,183
Too slow.

695
01:28:53,562 --> 01:28:55,481
Just kidding.
One more time.

696
01:29:01,738 --> 01:29:05,868
Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.

697
01:29:06,369 --> 01:29:10,832
The Terminator would never stop,
it would never leave him,

698
01:29:11,834 --> 01:29:12,876
never hurt him,

699
01:29:13,252 --> 01:29:16,380
never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him,

700
01:29:16,672 --> 01:29:19,009
or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.

701
01:29:19,384 --> 01:29:21,970
It would always be there.

702
01:29:22,345 --> 01:29:24,765
And it would die to protect him.

703
01:29:26,517 --> 01:29:29,521
Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went,

704
01:29:29,896 --> 01:29:34,067
this thing, this machine,
was the only one who measured up.

705
01:29:35,152 --> 01:29:39,198
In an insane world,
it was the sanest choice.

706
01:33:12,698 --> 01:33:15,325
She said you go south with him.

707
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:17,411
She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

708
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:20,123
Mom! Wait!

709
01:33:35,807 --> 01:33:36,809
"No fate."

710
01:33:39,437 --> 01:33:42,148
No fate but what we make.

711
01:33:43,108 --> 01:33:44,568
My father told her this.

712
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:52,577
I mean, I made him memorize it, up
in the future, as a message to her.

713
01:33:53,411 --> 01:33:54,538
Never mind.

714
01:33:55,206 --> 01:33:56,499
Now okay,

715
01:33:57,083 --> 01:34:01,129
the whole thing goes:
"The future is not set.

716
01:34:01,671 --> 01:34:05,008
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves."

717
01:34:05,384 --> 01:34:07,762
She intends to change the future.

718
01:34:08,262 --> 01:34:09,722
Yeah, I guess.

719
01:34:11,349 --> 01:34:12,601
Oh shit!

720
01:34:12,976 --> 01:34:14,144
Dyson.

721
01:34:14,478 --> 01:34:16,563
Yeah, gotta be!

722
01:34:16,897 --> 01:34:18,733
Miles Dyson!

723
01:34:19,067 --> 01:34:20,610
She's gonna blow him away!

724
01:34:20,902 --> 01:34:22,320
Come on! Let's go!

725
01:34:35,585 --> 01:34:38,339
This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

726
01:34:38,715 --> 01:34:41,426
The T-1000 has
the same files that I do.

727
01:34:41,718 --> 01:34:44,763
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

728
01:34:45,055 --> 01:34:47,015
I don't care. We've gotta stop her.

729
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:51,771
Killing Dyson might actually
prevent the war. - I don't care!

730
01:34:52,063 --> 01:34:55,901
Haven't you learnt anything yet?
Why you can't kill people?

731
01:34:58,821 --> 01:35:01,575
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die.

732
01:35:01,867 --> 01:35:04,870
But everybody's not like that!
We have feelings.

733
01:35:05,162 --> 01:35:07,039
We hurt. We're afraid.

734
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:13,839
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

735
01:35:50,632 --> 01:35:54,260
Danny, I told you
to go to bed like your sister.

736
01:35:54,552 --> 01:35:56,263
Just a couple of minutes, Mom.

737
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:15,911
Danny, your time is up.

738
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:18,497
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

739
01:37:01,798 --> 01:37:02,799
Danny just go!

740
01:37:13,604 --> 01:37:14,605
Oh my God!

741
01:37:22,030 --> 01:37:23,740
Just take Danny and go. Run!

742
01:37:25,493 --> 01:37:26,911
Oh Jesus, Miles.

743
01:37:48,977 --> 01:37:50,647
Nobody fucking move!

744
01:37:51,356 --> 01:37:53,691
Don't hurt my daddy!
Get on the floor!

745
01:37:53,983 --> 01:37:55,653
Fucking down! Now!

746
01:37:56,362 --> 01:37:57,905
Get out of the way!

747
01:37:58,280 --> 01:37:59,824
Don't hurt him!

748
01:38:00,116 --> 01:38:02,452
Get on the floor! Fast!

749
01:38:05,872 --> 01:38:07,792
Just let the boy go.

750
01:38:08,167 --> 01:38:09,377
Shut up! Shut up!

751
01:38:11,170 --> 01:38:12,588
It's all your fault!

752
01:38:13,841 --> 01:38:15,759
It's all your fault!
- What?

753
01:38:16,343 --> 01:38:18,137
I'm not gonna let you do it.

754
01:39:10,448 --> 01:39:11,866
Shit, we're too late.

755
01:39:16,955 --> 01:39:17,998
Check them.

756
01:39:21,961 --> 01:39:25,298
Look at me, Mom.
Are you hurt?

757
01:39:26,133 --> 01:39:27,384
Look at me.

758
01:39:29,595 --> 01:39:31,514
I almost...

759
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:34,184
I almost...

760
01:39:43,528 --> 01:39:47,741
It'll by okay.
We'll figure something out, okay?

761
01:39:49,243 --> 01:39:50,620
Promise.

762
01:39:54,582 --> 01:39:56,961
You came here to stop me?

763
01:39:58,170 --> 01:39:59,630
Yes, I did.

764
01:40:03,051 --> 01:40:04,511
I love you, John.

765
01:40:06,596 --> 01:40:09,392
I always have.

766
01:40:10,101 --> 01:40:11,602
I know.

767
01:40:18,944 --> 01:40:20,447
Clean penetration.

768
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,950
No shattered bone.

769
01:40:24,325 --> 01:40:28,164
Hold here. Compression
should stop the bleeding.

770
01:40:38,091 --> 01:40:39,135
Who are you?

771
01:40:40,428 --> 01:40:41,804
Show him.

772
01:40:44,683 --> 01:40:48,353
Danny, I want you to come with me.
Show me your room.

773
01:41:17,513 --> 01:41:19,890
Oh, my God!

774
01:41:30,694 --> 01:41:33,156
Now listen to me very carefully.

775
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:42,959
Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.

776
01:41:43,376 --> 01:41:49,049
Skynet, Judgment Day,
the history of things to come.

777
01:41:50,927 --> 01:41:53,304
It's not every day that you find out

778
01:41:53,596 --> 01:41:56,559
you're responsible
for 3 billion deaths.

779
01:41:56,851 --> 01:41:59,395
He took it pretty well.

780
01:42:00,813 --> 01:42:02,858
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

781
01:42:09,657 --> 01:42:10,867
You're judging me

782
01:42:11,409 --> 01:42:14,412
on things I haven't even done yet.

783
01:42:17,958 --> 01:42:20,377
How were we
supposed to know?

784
01:42:22,964 --> 01:42:25,049
Yeah. Right.

785
01:42:26,677 --> 01:42:29,555
How were you supposed to know?

786
01:42:30,139 --> 01:42:33,477
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

787
01:42:34,269 --> 01:42:38,398
Men like you thought it up.

788
01:42:42,028 --> 01:42:44,280
You think you're so creative.

789
01:42:45,282 --> 01:42:48,118
You don't know what it's like
to create something.

790
01:42:48,494 --> 01:42:50,245
To create a life.

791
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:52,415
To feel it growing inside you.

792
01:42:52,707 --> 01:42:56,419
All you know how to create
is death and destruction. - Mom!

793
01:42:57,171 --> 01:43:00,716
We need to be a little more
constructive here, okay?

794
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:03,762
We still have to
stop this from happening.

795
01:43:04,054 --> 01:43:05,555
But I thought...

796
01:43:06,097 --> 01:43:09,977
Aren't we changing things?
Changing the way it goes?

797
01:43:10,269 --> 01:43:11,395
That's right!

798
01:43:11,687 --> 01:43:15,108
There's no way I'm gonna
finish the processor. Not now.

799
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,944
Forget it. I'm out of it.

800
01:43:17,611 --> 01:43:20,239
I quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- Not good enough.

801
01:43:20,531 --> 01:43:25,370
No one must follow your work.
- Right, then...

802
01:43:27,081 --> 01:43:30,167
We have to destroy the stuff
at the lab. The files, drives...

803
01:43:30,543 --> 01:43:32,878
Everything. Everything here.

804
01:43:33,839 --> 01:43:36,633
Everything! I don't care.

805
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:41,514
Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

806
01:43:41,806 --> 01:43:44,684
In a vault at Cyberdyne.
From the other one like you.

807
01:43:44,977 --> 01:43:46,812
The CPU from the first terminator.

808
01:43:47,187 --> 01:43:49,273
Son of a bitch, I knew it!

809
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:52,068
They told us
not to ask where they got it.

810
01:43:52,443 --> 01:43:54,487
Those lying motherfuckers!

811
01:43:54,863 --> 01:43:56,364
It was radically advanced.

812
01:43:56,739 --> 01:44:00,286
It was smashed, it didn't work.
But it gave us ideas,

813
01:44:00,661 --> 01:44:03,373
took us in new directions.
Things we'd never...

814
01:44:06,042 --> 01:44:09,505
All my work is based on it.
- It must be destroyed.

815
01:44:12,258 --> 01:44:14,802
Can you get us in, past security?

816
01:44:15,179 --> 01:44:16,638
I think so, yeah.

817
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:18,098
When?

818
01:44:21,936 --> 01:44:22,937
Now?

819
01:44:27,276 --> 01:44:30,070
The future, always so clear to me,

820
01:44:30,362 --> 01:44:32,990
had become like
a black highway at night.

821
01:44:33,283 --> 01:44:35,994
We were
in uncharted territory now,

822
01:44:36,286 --> 01:44:38,747
making up history as we went along.

823
01:45:14,664 --> 01:45:15,666
Hi.

824
01:45:18,043 --> 01:45:19,670
Carl, right?

825
01:45:20,879 --> 01:45:23,091
Friends from outta town,
Thought I'd...

826
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:25,885
...show them around.

827
01:45:26,261 --> 01:45:29,223
You know
the rules concerning visitors.

828
01:45:29,598 --> 01:45:31,267
I need authorization...

829
01:45:32,852 --> 01:45:34,020
I insist.

830
01:45:35,105 --> 01:45:36,356
Don't even think about it.

831
01:45:50,664 --> 01:45:53,751
Takes 2 keys to open the vault,
turned simultaneously.

832
01:45:54,043 --> 01:45:56,337
The other one is
at the security station.

833
01:45:58,090 --> 01:45:59,091
Gibbons.

834
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:07,767
Come on, man,
you can't leave the desk like that.

835
01:46:12,648 --> 01:46:13,691
Oh, shit.

836
01:46:31,545 --> 01:46:33,088
My card should access this.

837
01:46:38,094 --> 01:46:39,931
What is it?
- Dammit.

838
01:46:40,431 --> 01:46:42,683
The silent alarm's been tripped.

839
01:46:49,107 --> 01:46:51,778
It's neutralized
all the codes in the building.

840
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:54,113
Nothing'll open anywhere now.

841
01:46:54,405 --> 01:46:56,282
We have to abort.

842
01:46:56,574 --> 01:46:57,617
No.

843
01:46:59,578 --> 01:47:02,665
We do it all the way! Okay?

844
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:08,630
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

845
01:47:09,005 --> 01:47:12,009
I think it's that guy
from the mall. - It is the guy!

846
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:14,178
Him and the woman.

847
01:47:15,221 --> 01:47:17,933
Just send everything
you've got in the area.

848
01:47:20,519 --> 01:47:24,023
I have a personal entry code
for the lab that may still work.

849
01:47:28,487 --> 01:47:31,156
It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

850
01:47:36,121 --> 01:47:37,831
John! Fire-in-the-hole!

851
01:47:50,804 --> 01:47:53,016
Wait! You can't go in there!

852
01:47:53,683 --> 01:47:56,060
The fire's set off the halo system!

853
01:48:02,193 --> 01:48:05,322
You have to wait a few minutes,
until the gas clears.

854
01:48:07,073 --> 01:48:08,074
Put this on.

855
01:48:22,884 --> 01:48:24,594
Alright, let's get to work.

856
01:48:46,411 --> 01:48:49,331
All units in the vicinity,
all units able to respond:

857
01:48:49,623 --> 01:48:54,254
A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer
Street, the Cyberdyne building.

858
01:48:54,546 --> 01:48:56,172
Suspect 1 is white, female,

859
01:48:56,464 --> 01:48:59,718
identified as: Last name Connor,
first name Sarah,

860
01:49:00,010 --> 01:49:02,680
escaped from
Pescadero State Hospital.

861
01:49:02,972 --> 01:49:04,223
Suspect 2: White, male...

862
01:49:08,562 --> 01:49:12,567
All the disks in my office. All the
disks in that office over there.

863
01:49:12,859 --> 01:49:14,777
Everything behind my desk.

864
01:49:15,069 --> 01:49:17,030
All the processors on my left.

865
01:49:17,322 --> 01:49:19,032
We'll blow it up with the CP4.

866
01:49:33,382 --> 01:49:34,718
Could I...

867
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:36,761
Excuse me...

868
01:49:39,014 --> 01:49:41,100
Could I borrow that thing?

869
01:49:50,652 --> 01:49:52,864
I worked a lot
of years on this thing.

870
01:49:57,035 --> 01:50:01,165
Give me that location again.
- 2111, Kramer.

871
01:50:01,457 --> 01:50:05,045
The suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.

872
01:50:56,437 --> 01:50:57,855
Alright,

873
01:50:58,189 --> 01:50:59,692
7-2-5-6.

874
01:51:02,194 --> 01:51:03,362
Yes!

875
01:51:07,325 --> 01:51:08,618
Easy money.

876
01:51:17,337 --> 01:51:21,174
Oh, shit.
Not good. Not good.

877
01:51:25,138 --> 01:51:28,141
How we doing?
- Primal cord is set.

878
01:51:28,516 --> 01:51:32,354
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

879
01:51:34,899 --> 01:51:37,402
How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

880
01:51:37,986 --> 01:51:39,571
Piece of cake.

881
01:51:39,863 --> 01:51:41,490
We got company.
- Police?

882
01:51:41,949 --> 01:51:44,577
How many?
- All of them, I think.

883
01:51:45,244 --> 01:51:47,915
Go! I'll finish here.

884
01:51:51,043 --> 01:51:54,005
I'll take care of the police.
- Wait, you swore...

885
01:51:57,258 --> 01:51:58,843
Trust me.

886
01:52:12,026 --> 01:52:13,986
Hey you at the window,

887
01:52:14,362 --> 01:52:17,908
drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head.

888
01:52:20,494 --> 01:52:22,996
That's a damn mini-gun!

889
01:52:45,147 --> 01:52:47,776
Come on! Go!

890
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:20,105
Go! Go!

891
01:53:35,582 --> 01:53:37,334
Fire!

892
01:53:54,938 --> 01:53:58,858
We go the same time to the left.
One, two, three, go!

893
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:13,292
Alright.
In order to get that out, you...

894
01:54:20,968 --> 01:54:24,722
We got Skynet by the balls now,
don't we? Come on, let's book!

895
01:54:26,266 --> 01:54:27,558
Hold your fire!

896
01:54:53,046 --> 01:54:55,425
Ready to rock?
- Ready.

897
01:54:58,845 --> 01:55:00,723
Time to go. Now.

898
01:55:01,473 --> 01:55:03,809
Take this. They'll use gas.

899
01:55:04,685 --> 01:55:06,146
Get started on the door.

900
01:55:06,813 --> 01:55:08,732
Miles, hand me the detonator.

901
01:55:32,343 --> 01:55:33,761
Mom! Mom!

902
01:56:21,733 --> 01:56:25,029
Shit! She's in the clean room.
There's no way out of there.

903
01:56:34,832 --> 01:56:35,833
Get down!

904
01:56:42,925 --> 01:56:44,343
Here.

905
01:57:09,623 --> 01:57:12,585
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

906
01:57:17,381 --> 01:57:18,382
Fall back!

907
01:57:18,759 --> 01:57:20,052
Everybody out!

908
01:57:20,427 --> 01:57:21,970
Move it! Now! Go!

909
01:57:58,262 --> 01:57:59,389
We have a war zone here.

910
01:58:32,553 --> 01:58:33,887
Shut your eyes.

911
01:58:39,811 --> 01:58:42,647
Stay here. I'll be back.

912
01:58:51,241 --> 01:58:52,951
Down on the floor, face down!

913
01:58:56,039 --> 01:58:57,248
On the floor, now!

914
01:59:00,251 --> 01:59:01,795
Okay, drop him!

915
02:00:21,305 --> 02:00:22,556
Here, hold this.

916
02:00:57,138 --> 02:00:58,139
Go!

917
02:01:50,701 --> 02:01:51,994
Get out!

918
02:02:11,683 --> 02:02:15,146
Listen, no matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

919
02:02:15,521 --> 02:02:17,398
You got it?
- Yeah.

920
02:02:32,875 --> 02:02:35,002
Chopper is coming in!
- It's him.

921
02:03:37,408 --> 02:03:38,451
Stay down!

922
02:04:46,322 --> 02:04:47,323
Hello?

923
02:04:53,538 --> 02:04:54,873
Goddamn,

924
02:04:55,248 --> 02:04:56,376
you alright?

925
02:05:03,509 --> 02:05:05,886
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

926
02:05:07,888 --> 02:05:09,724
Take the shotgun.
- Okay.

927
02:05:13,103 --> 02:05:15,106
Are you hurt?

928
02:05:28,121 --> 02:05:29,997
Holy shit. Come on!

929
02:05:30,456 --> 02:05:32,751
We need your truck.
- Hurry!

930
02:05:39,009 --> 02:05:40,343
Hurry!
- Get in.

931
02:05:50,856 --> 02:05:52,524
What the hell...

932
02:05:59,157 --> 02:06:01,159
I'm bleeding bad!
- Keep pressure on it.

933
02:06:02,577 --> 02:06:04,455
Here, this'll work.

934
02:06:10,754 --> 02:06:11,755
He's gaining!

935
02:06:14,675 --> 02:06:17,261
Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

936
02:06:17,636 --> 02:06:20,556
I can get out
and run faster than this!

937
02:06:30,068 --> 02:06:32,236
He's coming up, to the right.

938
02:06:58,101 --> 02:07:00,812
Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

939
02:07:07,653 --> 02:07:09,280
Take the off ramp.

940
02:07:24,715 --> 02:07:25,799
Hold on!

941
02:08:11,269 --> 02:08:12,812
Don't stop!

942
02:08:20,404 --> 02:08:21,865
Go straight!

943
02:08:40,428 --> 02:08:42,097
Get the hell out of here!

944
02:08:47,937 --> 02:08:49,855
Get out of here. Let's go!

945
02:10:07,863 --> 02:10:10,950
Hasta la vista, baby.

946
02:10:59,841 --> 02:11:01,175
We don't have much time.

947
02:11:24,161 --> 02:11:25,495
Let's go!

948
02:11:26,872 --> 02:11:29,125
Come on, we gotta get out of here!

949
02:11:29,667 --> 02:11:30,668
Get up!

950
02:11:43,808 --> 02:11:45,310
Hand me the shotgun.

951
02:11:50,483 --> 02:11:51,901
Put your weight on me, Mom.

952
02:11:53,695 --> 02:11:54,738
Hurry!

953
02:11:59,243 --> 02:12:00,328
Come on, Mom!

954
02:12:07,544 --> 02:12:09,546
Come on, Mom, get up!

955
02:12:39,998 --> 02:12:41,584
This way. Come on!

956
02:13:09,366 --> 02:13:10,618
Wait.

957
02:13:11,035 --> 02:13:12,996
Wait, no, it's too hot.

958
02:13:13,329 --> 02:13:14,497
Go back!

959
02:13:23,049 --> 02:13:24,968
Run!
- No, we stick together.

960
02:13:25,385 --> 02:13:28,054
John, you gotta go now.

961
02:13:28,514 --> 02:13:30,975
Go now!
- No!

962
02:14:43,977 --> 02:14:48,441
Take these steps. Go.

963
02:14:54,739 --> 02:14:57,284
Help me.
- I got you. Come on.

964
02:15:32,074 --> 02:15:34,744
Grab the chain. Grab it!

965
02:15:35,746 --> 02:15:37,331
Grab it! Go!

966
02:15:48,761 --> 02:15:50,262
Mom! Come on!

967
02:16:41,614 --> 02:16:42,824
Call to John.

968
02:16:44,534 --> 02:16:45,535
No.

969
02:16:46,202 --> 02:16:47,455
I know this hurts.

970
02:16:49,874 --> 02:16:50,916
Call John.

971
02:17:08,312 --> 02:17:09,813
Call to John now.

972
02:17:12,525 --> 02:17:13,860
Fuck you.

973
02:20:31,048 --> 02:20:33,050

974
02:20:40,434 --> 02:20:41,435
John!

975
02:20:56,703 --> 02:20:58,121
Help me.

976
02:21:01,667 --> 02:21:02,668
Out of the way, John!

977
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:07,633
Shoot!

978
02:22:02,196 --> 02:22:03,656
Down!

979
02:23:37,933 --> 02:23:39,101
Get up.

980
02:23:39,393 --> 02:23:40,519
Come on.

981
02:23:42,271 --> 02:23:43,731
Holy shit!

982
02:23:44,107 --> 02:23:46,526
I need a vacation.

983
02:24:00,125 --> 02:24:01,419
Is it dead?

984
02:24:02,753 --> 02:24:03,880
Terminated.

985
02:24:07,843 --> 02:24:09,052
Will this melt in there?

986
02:24:12,472 --> 02:24:13,850
Yes. Throw it in.

987
02:24:18,438 --> 02:24:19,690
Adios.

988
02:24:21,692 --> 02:24:22,860
And the chip.

989
02:24:38,086 --> 02:24:39,588
It's over.

990
02:24:42,549 --> 02:24:43,843
No.

991
02:24:46,846 --> 02:24:48,389
There is one more chip.

992
02:24:53,437 --> 02:24:55,147
And it must be
destroyed also.

993
02:25:01,029 --> 02:25:02,031
Here.

994
02:25:02,532 --> 02:25:07,579
I can't self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

995
02:25:14,754 --> 02:25:15,755
No!

996
02:25:19,843 --> 02:25:21,512
I'm sorry, John.

997
02:25:21,929 --> 02:25:23,639
It'll be okay. Stay with us!

998
02:25:25,099 --> 02:25:28,353
I have to go away.
- No don't do it, please don't go.

999
02:25:28,728 --> 02:25:31,398
I must go away, John.
- No.

1000
02:25:32,108 --> 02:25:33,109
No, wait.

1001
02:25:33,484 --> 02:25:34,777
You don't have to.

1002
02:25:35,152 --> 02:25:36,153
Sorry.

1003
02:25:37,488 --> 02:25:39,366
No, don't do it, don't go!

1004
02:25:39,741 --> 02:25:41,451
It has to end here.

1005
02:25:42,995 --> 02:25:45,790
I order you not to go.

1006
02:25:54,091 --> 02:25:56,553
I know now why you cry.

1007
02:25:58,471 --> 02:26:01,474
But it's something I can never do.

1008
02:26:35,681 --> 02:26:37,225
Goodbye.

1009
02:28:16,674 --> 02:28:19,427
The unknown future
rolls toward us.

1010
02:28:19,802 --> 02:28:22,765
I face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.

1011
02:28:23,766 --> 02:28:26,060
Because if a machine, a terminator,

1012
02:28:26,394 --> 02:28:28,855
can learn the value of human life,

1013
02:28:29,314 --> 02:28:32,025
maybe we can too.
