1
00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:16,949
Hey, you got a permit
for those guns?

2
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,919
I got your permit right here.

3
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,465
Catchy tune.

4
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,307
Fuck this game.

5
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:44,343
FUCK YOU!

6
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:22,548
We need backup,
we need Kung Fury.

7
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,566
Yeah, that's my bicep.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,202
One second babe.

9
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,871
Hello?

10
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,106
We got an arcade machine
down here going crazy,

11
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:49,308
it is killing everybody, it's
destruction, chaos, terror-

12
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:52,345
What are you gonna do?

13
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,546
My job.

14
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,548
Game over.

15
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,224
I'm a cop and
damn good at my job.

16
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:14,427
It all began years ago.

17
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,894
In the line of duty,

18
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:17,262
me and my partner were
chasing down

19
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:20,699
a mysterious Kung Fu-master.

20
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,301
You're under arrest, punk.

21
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:23,669
Show us your hands.

22
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:27,105
Good work, Dragon.

23
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,241
That crazy stunt could've
killed us both.

24
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:31,777
But goddammit, you're the
best partner I've ever had.

25
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:35,247
Thanks,
I learned from the best.

26
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:37,383
You're like a father to me.

27
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,219
With one fatal blow,
he hit my partner.

28
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:44,423
I could tell
he was dead straight off.

29
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,532
Before I could pull the trigger

30
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:57,135
I was hit by lightning
and bitten by a cobra.

31
00:03:57,235 --> 00:03:59,404
I blacked out.

32
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:05,177
And saw images of ancient
Shaolin temples and monks,

33
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,479
mastering the art of Kung Fu.

34
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,014
There was an ancient prophecy,

35
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:11,516
about a new form
of Kung Fu so powerful,

36
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:13,686
only one man could master it.

37
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,021
The chosen one.

38
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,590
When I woke up,

39
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,926
I saw the Kung Fu master
running towards me.

40
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:22,995
I could feel my body mutate

41
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:26,065
into some sort of
Kung Fu freak of nature.

42
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:38,711
You!

43
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,013
You are the chosen one!

44
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:45,084
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

45
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:47,720
Knuckles.

46
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,108
As a memento,

47
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,978
I put on a strip of cloth
from the dead Kung Fu master.

48
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:15,681
I decided I would use
my new super Kung Fu powers

49
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:17,249
to fight crime.

50
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,118
So, I became
the best cop in the world.

51
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,787
I became, Kung Fury.

52
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:15,140
I don't wanna hear it Kung Fury.

53
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,844
I just got back from city hall,
$50 million worth of damages,

54
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:22,247
and I got the mayor up
my ass like a fag on Viagra.

55
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:26,084
How am I going to explain
this to the press, hm?

56
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:29,821
You just destroyed an entire
city block for Christ's sake.

57
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:31,723
Didn't you tell me
to block it out?

58
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:33,392
I told you do it by the book.

59
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:34,793
Cut the bullshit.

60
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,195
Nobody else could have stopped

61
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,264
that arcade machine
and you know it.

62
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:43,368
Oh man, listen to me Kung Fury.

63
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:46,972
You need to start following
the rules like the rest of us,

64
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:49,074
so I'm assigning you
a new partner.

65
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,210
What?
Hell no, I work alone.

66
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,778
Not anymore you don't.

67
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:56,481
Say hi to your new partner,
Triceracop.

68
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:58,550
Very nice meeting you Kung Fury,

69
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,019
looking forward to
working with you.

70
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,122
You're like a father to me.

71
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,459
I work alone.

72
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,795
Either you team up
with Triceracop,

73
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:11,630
or you're off the case.

74
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,265
I'm not off the case,

75
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:14,400
I quit.

76
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:28,647
Yeah Yeah, I did the blood test.

77
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,449
It was positive, yeah?

78
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:31,550
What the hell
are you talking about?

79
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,352
Yeah no problem.

80
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,586
Give me the phone.

81
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:43,328
What the hell is this?

82
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,034
- Chief McNickles speaking.
- Is this the police?

83
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,570
- Yeah, this is the police.
- Fuck you!

84
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,988
MALFUNCTIONING?

85
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:12,725
I need someone
to trace that call!

86
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,693
But that's impossible!

87
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,195
Not for me it isn't.

88
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:26,372
Hackerman, he's the most
powerful hacker of all time.

89
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,277
Follow me.

90
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:36,782
I was able to triangulate
the cell phone signal

91
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,150
and trace the caller.

92
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:41,753
His name is Adolf Hitler.

93
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,024
Hitler, he's the worst
criminal of all time.

94
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,558
Do you know him, sir?

95
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,093
I guess you could say that.

96
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,897
In the 1940's,
Hitler was a Kung Fu champion.

97
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:53,765
He was so good at Kung Fu,

98
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:57,436
that he decided to change
his name to Kung Fuhrer.

99
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:00,005
But he didn't stop there.

100
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,073
He knew of
the Kung Fury prophecy,

101
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,908
and wanted to claim the throne.

102
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:06,144
He and his posse of
Nazi soldiers

103
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:08,047
conducted experiments
for years.

104
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,859
But they weren't able
to figure out

105
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,462
how to master the art
of Kung Fury.

106
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:26,030
And one day,

107
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,299
he disappeared
from the face of the earth.

108
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,635
And no-one has seen him
ever since.

109
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,437
Until now.

110
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:35,373
I guess he figured if he could
find and kill the chosen one,

111
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:37,442
he would become
Kung Fury himself.

112
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:40,012
He must have traveled in time
in order to get here,

113
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,814
that's probably why
he disappeared.

114
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:44,283
So, what're you gonna do?

115
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,185
My job.

116
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,653
I'm gonna go back in time
to Nazi Germany,

117
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,555
and kill Hitler,
once and for all.

118
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,757
So, how are you gonna do that?

119
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:54,693
I'm not sure.

120
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,595
I need some sort of
time machine.

121
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:02,100
Wait a minute,

122
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,169
using an RX modulator,
I might be able to conduct

123
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:06,938
a mainframe cell direct and
hack the uplink to the download.

124
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:08,640
What does that mean?

125
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,577
With the right algorithms,
I can hack you back in time.

126
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:14,613
Just like a time machine.

127
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:17,115
Well then, it's hacking time.

128
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,727
Oh, no!

129
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,723
Fuck!

130
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,457
That's a Laser-Raptor.

131
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,793
I thought they went
extinct thousands of years ago.

132
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:07,519
Who are you?

133
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:08,720
My name,

134
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:11,323
is Barbarianna.

135
00:13:17,862 --> 00:13:19,564
What year is this?

136
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:21,233
It's the Viking age.

137
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,868
That explains the Laser-Raptor.
Fuck!

138
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:25,971
I went too far back in time.

139
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,039
You need to get out
of this valley.

140
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,442
This place is swarming
with Laser-Raptors.

141
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:33,878
I'll meet you at the God's drop.
Katana can help you get there.

142
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:35,647
Who's Katana?

143
00:13:35,747 --> 00:13:36,882
I'm Katana.

144
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,821
I can give you a ride to Asgard.

145
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,690
A ride on what?

146
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:09,047
So, who are you?

147
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:11,950
I'm a cop from the future.

148
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,152
I was sent back in time
to kill Hitler,

149
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:18,724
but I accidently went
too far back in time

150
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,159
and ended up in this place.

151
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:25,564
I know someone
who might be able to help you.

152
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:33,772
Thor!

153
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,322
Behold! It is me, Thor!

154
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:54,359
Son of Odin
and protector of mankind.

155
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,394
Check out my pecs.

156
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:57,896
Your pecs are epic.

157
00:14:57,996 --> 00:14:59,364
Thanks bro!

158
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:06,205
So, anyway.

159
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,774
Thor, this is Kung Fury,
he's a cop from the future.

160
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:13,411
Yeah, I need to get to
Nazi Germany and kill Hitler...

161
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:15,981
- so if you could help me with-
- Stop!

162
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,384
Hammer time.

163
00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:27,993
Walk through this portal and
you'll end up in Nazi Germany.

164
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,629
Good luck to you Kung Fury!

165
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,797
Thanks Thor!

166
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,273
Well,
looks like this is my ride.

167
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:44,910
Hey, future cop,
where are you going?

168
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:52,384
You know what.
Here, take my number.

169
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:55,520
And use this phone to call me.

170
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,623
It's a personal, transportable,
cellular telephone.

171
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:01,993
It features 645 channel
capacity,

172
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:06,331
10 number speed dial,
and an electronic security lock.

173
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:09,701
This revolution in communication
could make it possible

174
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:12,904
for more and more people
to have a phone in their car!

175
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,451
Tank you.

176
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:46,364
I'm the greatest Kung Fu master
of all time,

177
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:47,766
right guys?

178
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:57,442
Thank you!

179
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,390
I'm disarming you.

180
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,559
My arm! My arm!

181
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,541
Kill him!

182
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:03,568
You don't need that spine,

183
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,105
it's holding your back!

184
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,269
A-ha!

185
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:39,770
Fuck you Kung Fury.

186
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:43,841
Now nothing can stop me
and my army of death.

187
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:57,289
Thank you guys!

188
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:05,897
What the fuck?

189
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:50,908
Kill them!

190
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:51,436
Alright Hitler, the gig is up,
show me your hands.

191
00:23:09,286 --> 00:23:12,357
Hackerman,
have you seen Kung Fury?

192
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,128
Oh, no! We were too late.

193
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,267
Who the hell are you?

194
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:59,470
My name is Cobra.

195
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,208
I've been expecting you
Kung Fury.

196
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,543
I'm your spirit animal.

197
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:07,512
What the hell is this place?

198
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:12,016
This is heaven,
I'm afraid you're dead.

199
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,219
What?

200
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,621
But it looks so real.

201
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:20,858
Yeah, no it's totally real.

202
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,093
Mr. Cobra, I'm a police officer.

203
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:26,564
I need you to send me
back to earth, pronto.

204
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:28,866
I'm sorry,
I can't help you with that.

205
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:31,668
You see, you're dead.

206
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:34,005
- You're under arrest!
- What?

207
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:38,776
For obstruction of justice,
you're breaking the law!

208
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:54,058
What the hell happened?

209
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:56,794
I hacked away all of
your bullet wounds Kung Fury.

210
00:24:56,894 --> 00:24:58,129
Thanks!

211
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:23,354
I want to welcome you
and your friends to Germany.

212
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,760
We are not so different,
you and I.

213
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,263
I mean we both got
good style, you know?

214
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,032
Red, you know?

215
00:25:34,732 --> 00:25:36,000
So, that's cool!

216
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:41,606
We both like doing moves,
check it out!

217
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,946
And killing people, I love it,
you clearly do, too!

218
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:50,281
And that's cool!

219
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:52,917
Join me,

220
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:56,387
we could be brothers,
we are so alike.

221
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:59,290
It's almost like
we finish each other's...

222
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,925
- Balls.
- What?

223
00:26:23,347 --> 00:26:25,717
Oh, my,
not much left of him is there?

224
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,685
The important thing is that
he is gone.

225
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:31,121
Sorry I doubted you Triceracop.

226
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,157
You're the best damn partner
I've ever had.

227
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:36,327
I came back in time
for you Kung Fury,

228
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:38,729
because, damn it,
I love you.

229
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,070
Team work is very important.

230
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:50,441
So, what happens now Kung Fury?

231
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,580
Well, I need to
head back to the office.

232
00:26:57,448 --> 00:27:00,084
Looks like it's gonna be
hell of a lot of paperwork.

233
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,141
Open the doors, Hoff.

234
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:26,978
I'm sorry Fury,
I can't let you do that.

235
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,780
Open the doors, Hoff!

236
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,082
I'm sorry, I can't let you
open the doors Kung Fury.

237
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:33,817
Goddammit, open the doors!

238
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:37,522
- Sorry I can't-
- Open the doors!

239
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:43,127
Did anyone ever tell you
not to hassle the Hoff 9000?

240
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:46,264
Oh, Hoff 9000,
you son of a bitch.

241
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:02,846
Piece of shit.

242
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,931
Oh, my,
not much left of him is there?

243
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:24,401
The important thing is that
he is gone.

244
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,615
Game over.

245
00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:40,685
Wait a minute,

246
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:44,622
I've seen that symbol before...

247
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,159
somewhere.

248
00:28:57,568 --> 00:28:58,769
Hitler!
