1
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,158
The world is changed.

2
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,272
I feel it in the water.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,798
I feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,198
I smell it in the air.

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,391
Much that once was...

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,079
...is lost.

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,672
For none now live who remember it.

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,238
It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.

9
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,237
Three were given to the Elves.

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,069
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,071
Seven to the Dwarf-lords.

12
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,032
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,674
And nine...

14
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,758
...nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,635
... who, above all else, desire power.

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,714
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,197
But they were all of them deceived.

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,431
For another ring was made.

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,676
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,358
... the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,516
... to control all others.

22
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,508
And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,759
...and his will to dominate all life.

24
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,389
One Ring to rule them all.

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,792
One by one...

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,471
... the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.

27
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,592
But there were some who resisted.

28
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,511
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,157
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

30
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,754
Victory was near.

31
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,992
But the power of the Ring...

32
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,153
...could not be undone.

33
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,591
It was in this moment...

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,075
... when all hope had faded...

35
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,239
... that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

36
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,275
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

37
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,950
The Ring passed to Isildur...

38
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,199
... who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

39
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,916
But the hearts of Men...

40
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,509
...are easily corrupted.

41
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,197
And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.

42
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,874
It betrayed Isildur...

43
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,949
... to his death.

44
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,669
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

45
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,110
... were lost.

46
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,036
History became legend...

47
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,151
...legend became myth.

48
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,079
And for
two and a half thousand years...

49
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,829
... the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.

50
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,159
Until, when chance came...

51
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,792
...it ensnared a new bearer.

52
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,710
My precious.

53
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,349
The Ring came to the creature
Gollum...

54
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,314
... who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

55
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,353
And there it consumed him.

56
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,516
It came to me.

57
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,952
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,676
My precious.

59
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,436
The Ring brought to Gollum
unnatural long life.

60
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,315
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

61
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,911
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.

62
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,237
Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.

63
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,199
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

64
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,073
... whispers of a nameless fear.

65
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,431
And the Ring of Power perceived...

66
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,313
...its time had now come.

67
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,200
It abandoned Gollum.

68
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,152
But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.

69
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,351
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

70
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,549
What's this?

71
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,113
A Hobbit.

72
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,959
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

73
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,832
A ring.

74
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,837
Lost!

75
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,790
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,195
For the time will soon come...

77
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,389
... when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

78
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,872
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,152
...in the year 1 400...

80
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,510
...by Shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,238
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing...

82
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,351
...the Shire...

83
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,279
...Middle-earth.

84
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,917
The Third Age of this world.

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,834
There and Back Again.

86
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,078
A Hobbit's Tale.

87
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,034
By Bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,352
Now...

89
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,951
...where to begin?

90
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,189
Ah, yes....

91
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,277
''Concerning...

92
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,873
...Hobbits.''

93
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,316
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

94
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,397
...for many hundreds of years...

95
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,433
...quite content to ignore
and be ignored...

96
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,677
...by the world of the Big Folk.

97
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,398
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

98
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,637
...Hobbits must seem
of little importance...

99
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,674
...being neither renowned
as great warriors...

100
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,873
...nor counted among the very wise.

101
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,958
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,554
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

103
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,992
... that Hobbits' only real passion
is for food.

104
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,430
A rather unfair observation...

105
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,155
...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

106
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,199
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

107
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,359
But where our hearts truly lie...

108
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,551
...is in peace and quiet...

109
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,310
...and good, tilled earth.

110
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,469
For all Hobbits share a love
of things that grow.

111
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,672
And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.

112
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,908
But today of all days,
it is brought home to me.

113
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,191
It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.

114
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,232
Frodo, the door!

115
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,717
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,558
Frodo!

117
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,510
Down from the door where it began

118
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,709
And I must follow if I can

119
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,639
The road goes ever on and on

120
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,150
Down from the door where it began

121
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,115
Now far ahead the road has gone

122
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,355
-And I must follow if I can
-You're late.

123
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,149
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

124
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,357
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

125
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,198
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

126
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,469
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

127
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,156
How is the old rascal?

128
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,036
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

129
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,549
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

130
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,591
Well, that should please him.

131
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,597
Half the Shire's been invited.

132
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,354
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

133
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,551
And so life in the Shire goes on...

134
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,638
... very much as it has
this past Age...

135
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:48,119
...full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

136
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,151
If it comes at all.

137
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,636
For things are made to endure
in the Shire...

138
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,196
...passing from one generation
to the next.

139
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,355
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

140
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,834
...in Bag End.

141
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,153
And there always will be.

142
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,116
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

143
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,436
I mean, more than usual.

144
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,237
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

145
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,753
He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.

146
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,552
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,270
He's up to something.

148
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,469
-All right, then. Keep your secrets.
-What?

149
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,318
But I know you have something
to do with it.

150
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,549
Good gracious me.

151
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,639
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

152
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,716
Indeed.

153
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,116
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

154
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,312
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

155
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,910
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

156
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,079
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

157
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,237
Oh, really?

158
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,551
Gandalf! Gandalf!

159
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,629
Fireworks, Gandalf!

160
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,114
-Gandalf!
-Fireworks, Gandalf!

161
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,189
Gandalf?

162
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,673
-I'm glad you're back.
-So am I, dear boy.

163
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,672
So am I.

164
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,553
No, thank you!

165
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,548
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

166
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,116
And what about very old friends?

167
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,798
Gandalf?

168
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,756
-Bilbo Baggins.
-My dear Gandalf!

169
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,875
Good to see you. 1 1 1 years old!
Who would believe it?

170
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,471
You haven't aged a day.

171
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,757
Come on, come in!

172
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,235
Welcome, welcome.

173
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,794
Oh, here we are.

174
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,709
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

175
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,549
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1 296.

176
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,639
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

177
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,038
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

178
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,800
Just tea, thank you.

179
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,518
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

180
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,871
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

181
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,074
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

182
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,511
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

183
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,474
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart....

184
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,954
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

185
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,879
I've just found some sponge cake.

186
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,914
I could make you some eggs
if you'd--

187
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,160
-Just tea, thank you.
-Oh, right.

188
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,430
-You don't mind if I eat, do you?
-No, not at all.

189
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,277
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

190
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,993
I'm not at home!

191
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,228
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

192
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,431
-I know you're in there!
-They're after the house.

193
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,469
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

194
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,319
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

195
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,397
...never giving me a moment's peace.

196
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,436
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

197
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,997
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

198
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,954
-So you mean to go through with your plan?
-Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

199
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,310
All the arrangements are made.

200
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,759
Oh, thank you.

201
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,476
Frodo suspects something.

202
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,035
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

203
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,754
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

204
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,959
You will tell him, won't you?

205
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,756
-Yes, yes.
-He's very fond of you.

206
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,359
I know.

207
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,836
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

208
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,716
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

209
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,430
The woods, the fields.

210
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,870
Little rivers.

211
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,754
I am old, Gandalf.

212
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,114
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

213
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,589
I feel thin.

214
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,438
Sort of stretched...

215
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,831
...like butter scraped
over too much bread.

216
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,352
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

217
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,632
And I don't expect I shall return.

218
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,832
In fact, I mean not to.

219
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,313
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

220
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,394
Gandalf, my old friend...

221
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,319
...this will be a night to remember.

222
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,235
Hello, hello.

223
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,359
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

224
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,794
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

225
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,710
-I think I'll just have another ale.
-Oh, no, you don't.

226
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,438
Go on!

227
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,912
So there I was...

228
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,999
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

229
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,111
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

230
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,595
...about how they were
going to cook us.

231
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,635
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

232
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,990
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

233
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,636
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

234
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,989
...and turned them all to stone!

235
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,393
Quickly.

236
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,356
Up they go!

237
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,269
No, the big one.

238
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,799
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

239
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,797
Are all these children yours?

240
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,878
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

241
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,074
Bilbo?

242
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,358
Sackville-Bagginses!

243
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,595
Quickly, hide!

244
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,190
Thank you, my boy.

245
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,870
You're a good lad, Frodo.

246
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,793
I'm very selfish, you know.

247
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,556
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

248
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,950
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

249
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,599
...but it wasn't out of charity.

250
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,473
I think it was because...

251
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,910
...of all my numerous relations...

252
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,556
...you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

253
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,558
Bilbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

254
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,392
No.

255
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,148
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

256
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,511
The point is, Frodo...

257
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,396
...you'll be all right.

258
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,596
-Done!
-You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

259
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,199
-It is in the ground.
-Outside!

260
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,879
This was your idea.

261
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,559
Bilbo.

262
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,313
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

263
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,751
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

264
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,150
-That was good.
-Let's get another one.

265
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,712
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

266
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,717
I might've known.

267
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,351
Speech, Bilbo!

268
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,428
Speech!

269
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,629
Speech!

270
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,830
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

271
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,670
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

272
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,269
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

273
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,469
...Hornblowers...

274
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,192
...Bolgers...

275
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,039
...Bracegirdles...

276
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,754
-...and Proudfoots.
-Proudfeet!

277
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,877
Today is my 1 1 1th birthday!

278
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,079
Happy birthday!

279
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,353
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

280
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,358
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

281
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,879
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

282
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,471
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

283
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,315
I have things to do.

284
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,476
I've put this off far too long.

285
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,948
I regret to announce this is the end!

286
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,195
I'm going now.

287
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,033
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

288
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,469
Goodbye.

289
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,352
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

290
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,757
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

291
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,795
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

292
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,070
It was just a bit of fun.

293
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,829
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

294
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,550
-You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
-Two eyes.

295
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,320
As often as I can spare them.

296
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,557
-I'm leaving everything to him.
-What about this ring of yours?

297
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,957
-Is that staying too?
-Yes, yes.

298
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,269
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

299
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,153
No. Wait, it's...

300
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,154
...here in my pocket.

301
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,671
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

302
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,636
Yet, after all, why not?

303
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,796
-Why shouldn't I keep it?
-I think you should leave the ring behind.

304
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,270
Is that so hard?

305
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,754
Well, no.

306
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,519
And yes.

307
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,358
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

308
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,232
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

309
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,479
-There's no need to get angry.
-Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

310
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,638
It's mine.

311
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,229
My own.

312
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,348
-My precious.
-Precious?

313
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,313
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

314
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,994
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

315
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,839
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

316
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,759
-You want it for yourself!
-Bilbo Baggins!

317
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,033
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

318
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,755
I am not trying to rob you.

319
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,198
I'm trying to help you.

320
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,517
All your long years,
we've been friends.

321
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,956
Trust me as you once did.

322
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,512
Let it go.

323
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,915
You're right, Gandalf.

324
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,514
The ring must go to Frodo.

325
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,633
It's late. The road is long.

326
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,229
Yes, it is time.

327
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,709
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

328
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,912
I've thought up an ending for my book:

329
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,270
''And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days.''

330
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,756
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

331
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,159
Goodbye, Gandalf.

332
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,313
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

333
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,873
The road goes ever on and on

334
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,629
Until our next meeting.

335
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,310
It's mine. My own.

336
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,830
My precious.

337
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,878
Riddles in the dark.

338
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,433
Bilbo!

339
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,119
Bilbo!

340
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,433
My precious.

341
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,076
Precious.

342
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,714
He's gone, hasn't he?

343
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,318
He talked for so long about leaving...

344
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,114
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

345
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,231
Gandalf?

346
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,752
Bilbo's ring.

347
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,355
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

348
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,518
He's left you Bag End.

349
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,389
Along with all his possessions.

350
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,398
The ring is yours now.

351
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,190
-Put it somewhere out of sight.
-Where are you going?

352
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,550
-There are some things that I must see to.
-What things?

353
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,878
-Questions. Questions that need answering.
-You've only just arrived.

354
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,234
I don't understand.

355
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,389
Neither do I.

356
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,715
Keep it secret.

357
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,638
Keep it safe.

358
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,270
Shire!

359
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,552
Baggins!

360
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,918
''The year 3434 of the Second Age.

361
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,318
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

362
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,035
...and the finding
of the Ring of Power. ''

363
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,152
''It has come to me.

364
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,670
The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.

365
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,156
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

366
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,989
...for I will risk
no hurt to the Ring.

367
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,589
It is precious to me...

368
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,954
... though I buy it with great pain.

369
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,999
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

370
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,836
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

371
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,919
A secret now
that only fire can tell. ''

372
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,593
Shire.

373
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,711
Baggins.

374
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,079
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

375
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,153
That way.

376
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,990
To heal my heart and drown my woe

377
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,395
Rain may fall and wind may blow

378
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,431
But there still be

379
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,993
Many miles to go

380
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,031
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

381
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,310
And the stream that falls
From hill to plain

382
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,278
Better than rain or rippling brook

383
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,755
Is a mug of beer inside this Took

384
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,753
There's been some strange folk
crossing the Shire.

385
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,875
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

386
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,679
War is brewing.

387
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,073
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

388
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,748
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

389
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,238
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

390
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,273
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

391
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,799
And proud of it.

392
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,150
-Cheers, Gaffer.
-Cheers.

393
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,273
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

394
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,598
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

395
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,910
-Good night, lads.
-Good night.

396
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,398
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

397
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,830
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

398
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,397
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

399
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,509
Does she?

400
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,032
-Good night, Sam.
-Good night, Mister Frodo.

401
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,149
Is it secret? Is it safe?

402
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,716
What are you doing?

403
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,234
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

404
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,555
It's quite cool.

405
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,638
What can you see?

406
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,629
Can you see anything?

407
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,559
Nothing.

408
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,111
There's nothing.

409
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,593
Wait.

410
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,670
There are markings.

411
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,350
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

412
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,028
There are few who can.

413
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,190
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

414
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,789
Mordor!

415
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,991
In the common tongue, it says:

416
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,556
''One Ring to rule them all...

417
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,990
...One Ring to find them...

418
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,316
...One Ring to bring them all...

419
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,472
...and in the darkness bind them.''

420
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,996
This is the One Ring...

421
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,228
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

422
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,319
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

423
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,508
Bilbo found it.

424
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,797
-In Gollum's cave.
-Yes.

425
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,357
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

426
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,791
...prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

427
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,638
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

428
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,149
The Ring has awoken.

429
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,999
It's heard its master's call.

430
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,909
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

431
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,391
No, Frodo.

432
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,471
The spirit of Sauron endured.

433
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,800
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

434
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,156
Sauron has returned.

435
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,031
His Orcs have multiplied.

436
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,074
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

437
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,876
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

438
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,036
He is seeking it.

439
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,949
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

440
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,754
For the Ring yearns above all else...

441
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,236
...to return to the hand
of its master.

442
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,112
They are one...

443
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,278
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

444
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,469
Frodo...

445
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,797
...he must never find it.

446
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,989
All right.

447
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,438
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

448
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,200
No one knows it's here, do they?

449
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,789
Do they, Gandalf?

450
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,076
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

451
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,152
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

452
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,396
But the enemy found him first.

453
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,435
I don't know how long
they tortured him.

454
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,918
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words.

455
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,156
Shire!

456
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,918
Baggins!

457
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,838
Shire.

458
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,793
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

459
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,509
Who goes there?

460
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,349
Take it, Gandalf!

461
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,715
-Take it!
-No, Frodo.

462
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,195
-You must take it!
-You cannot offer me this ring!

463
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,597
-I'm giving it to you!
-Don't tempt me, Frodo!

464
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,196
I dare not take it.

465
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,875
Not even to keep it safe.

466
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,876
Understand, Frodo...

467
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,990
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

468
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,672
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

469
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,038
-But it cannot stay in the Shire!
-No.

470
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,398
No, it can't.

471
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,839
What must I do?

472
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,830
-You must leave. And leave quickly.
-Where? Where do I go?

473
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,157
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

474
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,475
Bree.

475
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,319
-What about you?
-I'll be waiting for you...

476
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,875
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

477
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,629
-And the Ring will be safe there?
-I don't know, Frodo.

478
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,751
I don't have any answers.

479
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,513
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

480
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,756
He'll know what to do.

481
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,079
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

482
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,669
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

483
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,471
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

484
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,157
I can cut across country
easily enough.

485
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,834
My dear Frodo.

486
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,998
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

487
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,998
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

488
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,430
And yet, after a hundred years...

489
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,596
...they can still surprise you.

490
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,434
Get down.

491
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,470
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

492
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,958
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

493
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,469
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

494
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,399
-I heard raised voices.
-What did you hear? Speak!

495
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,669
Nothing important.

496
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,113
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but--

497
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,871
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

498
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,118
No?

499
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,349
Perhaps not.

500
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,836
I've thought of a better use for you.

501
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,398
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

502
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,956
Be careful, both of you.

503
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,879
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

504
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,918
Birds, beasts.

505
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,352
Is it safe?

506
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,279
Never put it on...

507
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,711
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

508
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,353
Always remember, Frodo...

509
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,877
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

510
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,276
It wants to be found.

511
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,316
This is it.

512
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,676
This is what?

513
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,991
If I take one more step...

514
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,189
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

515
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,673
Come on, Sam.

516
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,552
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

517
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,675
-''It's a dangerous business, Frodo.''
-''Going out your door.

518
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,112
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

519
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,313
... there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to. ''

520
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,352
Sam.

521
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,749
Wood-elves.

522
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,310
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

523
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,512
To the Grey Havens.

524
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,991
They're leaving Middle-earth.

525
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,316
Never to return.

526
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,111
I don't know why...

527
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,075
...it makes me sad.

528
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,511
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

529
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,838
Just shut your eyes...

530
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,679
...and imagine you're back
in your own bed...

531
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,634
...with a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

532
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,120
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

533
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,073
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

534
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,595
Me neither, Sam.

535
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,832
Smoke rises
from the Mountain of Doom.

536
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,598
The hour grows late.

537
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,236
And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...

538
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,749
...seeking my counsel.

539
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,748
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

540
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,188
My old friend.

541
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,993
Saruman.

542
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,478
-You are sure of this?
-Beyond any doubt.

543
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,430
So the Ring of Power has been found.

544
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,712
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

545
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,992
-Under my very nose.
-Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

546
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,792
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

547
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,473
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

548
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,113
Time?

549
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,554
What time do you think we have?

550
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,635
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

551
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,956
He cannot yet take physical form...

552
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,754
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

553
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,269
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

554
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,511
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

555
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,952
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

556
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,868
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

557
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,518
The Eye of Sauron.

558
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,188
He is gathering all evil to him.

559
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,431
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army...

560
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,273
...great enough for an assault
upon Middle-earth.

561
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,875
You know this?

562
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,833
How?

563
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,992
I have seen it.

564
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,472
A palantyr is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

565
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,593
Why?

566
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,634
Why should we fear to use it?

567
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,948
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

568
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,232
We do not know who else
may be watching.

569
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,314
The hour is later than you think.

570
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,750
Sauron's forces are already moving.

571
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,559
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

572
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,909
The Nine?

573
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,998
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

574
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,760
...disguised as riders in black.

575
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,748
-They've reached the Shire?
-They will find the Ring.

576
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,436
And kill the one who carries it.

577
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,353
Frodo!

578
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,672
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

579
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,073
There are none who can.

580
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,074
Against the power of Mordor...

581
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,794
...there can be no victory.

582
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,717
We must join with him, Gandalf.

583
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,190
We must join with Sauron.

584
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,320
It would be wise, my friend.

585
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,159
Tell me...

586
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,349
...friend...

587
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,677
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

588
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,198
I gave you the chance...

589
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,794
...of aiding me willingly...

590
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,993
...but you have elected
the way of pain!

591
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,793
Mr. Frodo?

592
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,078
Frodo? Frodo!

593
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,512
-I thought I'd lost you.
-What are you talking about?

594
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,598
-It's just something Gandalf said.
-What did he say?

595
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,109
''Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee.''
And I don't mean to.

596
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,830
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

597
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,669
Frodo.

598
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,070
-Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
-Hello, Frodo.

599
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,599
Get off him.

600
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,479
Come on, Frodo.

601
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,477
What's the meaning of this?

602
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,878
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

603
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,036
You get back here!

604
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,228
Get out of my field!

605
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,159
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

606
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,158
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

607
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,395
And some cabbages.

608
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,398
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

609
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,479
-And then the mushrooms the week before.
-Yes, Pippin. My point is...

610
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,750
...he's clearly overreacting.

611
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,393
Run!

612
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,754
Oh, that was close.

613
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,792
I think I've broken something.

614
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,990
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

615
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,670
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

616
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,030
-Short cut to what?
-Mushrooms!

617
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,873
That's mine.

618
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,078
That's nice, Merry.

619
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,511
Here's a nice one, Sam.

620
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,154
I think we should get off the road.

621
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,279
Get off the road!

622
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,913
Quick!

623
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,513
Be quiet!

624
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,190
What was that?

625
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,993
Anything?

626
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,073
Nothing.

627
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,955
What is going on?

628
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,109
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

629
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,833
Frodo?

630
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,469
Get down!

631
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,836
I have to leave the Shire.

632
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,995
Sam and I must get to Bree.

633
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,599
Right.

634
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,070
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

635
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,314
Run!

636
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,391
This way! Follow me!

637
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,829
Run!

638
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,272
Get the rope, Sam!

639
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,279
Frodo!

640
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,313
Run, Frodo!

641
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,675
Go!
-Hurry!

642
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,394
Frodo, come on!

643
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,236
-Come on! Faster!
-Jump!

644
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:00,599
-How far to the nearest crossing?
-The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

645
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,033
Come on.

646
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,070
-What do you want?
-We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

647
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,119
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

648
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:40,108
What's more, out of the Shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

649
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,558
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

650
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,069
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

651
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,669
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

652
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,599
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

653
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,870
Can't be too careful.

654
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,116
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

655
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,718
Excuse me.

656
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,359
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

657
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:51,396
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

658
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,071
Always proud to cater
to the Little Folk, Mister...?

659
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,076
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

660
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,669
-Underhill, yes.
-We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

661
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,917
-Can you tell him we've arrived?
-Gandalf?

662
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,992
Gandalf.

663
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,398
Oh, yes...

664
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,591
...I remember. Elderly chap.

665
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,753
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

666
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,872
Not seen him for six months.

667
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,628
What do we do now?

668
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,709
Sam...

669
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,717
...he'll be here. He'll come.

670
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,351
Get out of my way!

671
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,232
What's that?

672
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,829
This, my friend, is a pint.

673
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,598
It comes in pints?

674
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,509
-I'm getting one.
-You got a whole half already!

675
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,275
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

676
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,113
Excuse me.

677
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,718
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

678
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:17,038
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

679
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,632
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

680
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,069
Strider.

681
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,672
Baggins.

682
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,479
Baggins.

683
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,470
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

684
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,959
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

685
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,072
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

686
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,430
...and my third cousin, twice removed....

687
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,478
-Pippin!
-Steady on, Frodo.

688
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,155
You cannot hide.

689
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,992
I see you.

690
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,200
There is no life...

691
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,470
...in the void.

692
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,113
Only...

693
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,433
...death.

694
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,876
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, ''Mr. Underhill.''

695
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,309
What do you want?

696
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,476
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

697
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,758
-I carry nothing.
-Indeed.

698
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,429
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

699
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,189
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

700
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,194
-Who are you?
-Are you frightened?

701
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,309
Yes.

702
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,274
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

703
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,554
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

704
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,073
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

705
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,078
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

706
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,315
They're coming.

707
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,913
What are they?

708
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,036
They were once Men.

709
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,356
Great kings of Men.

710
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,877
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

711
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,432
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

712
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,791
One by one, falling into darkness.

713
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,389
Now they are slaves to his will.

714
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,318
They are the Nazgûl.

715
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,114
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

716
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,193
At all times they feel...

717
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,231
... the presence of the Ring...

718
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,797
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

719
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,193
-Where are you taking us?
-Into the Wild.

720
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,919
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

721
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,839
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

722
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,954
-...and feel fouler.
-He's foul enough.

723
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,239
We have no choice but to trust him.

724
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,716
-But where is he leading us?
-To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

725
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,151
-To the house of Elrond.
-Did you hear that? Rivendell.

726
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,359
We're going to see the Elves.

727
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:02,159
-Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
-What about breakfast?

728
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,920
-You've already had it.
-We've had one, yes.

729
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,236
What about second breakfast?

730
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:13,557
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

731
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,754
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

732
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,953
-He knows about them, doesn't he?
-I wouldn't count on it.

733
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,758
Pippin!

734
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,910
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

735
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,276
Who is she?

736
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,428
This woman you sing of.

737
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,995
'Tis the lady of Lûthien.

738
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:42,149
The Elf-maiden who gave her love
to Beren, a mortal.

739
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,956
What happened to her?

740
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,469
She died.

741
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,590
Get some sleep, Frodo.

742
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:10,353
The power of Isengard
is at your command...

743
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:14,792
... Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

744
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,552
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

745
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,198
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

746
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,471
We have work to do.

747
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,791
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

748
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,917
Rip them all down.

749
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,998
This was the great watchtower
of Amon Sûl.

750
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,154
We shall rest here tonight.

751
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,670
These are for you.
Keep them close.

752
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,269
I'm going to have a look around.

753
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,351
Stay here.

754
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,870
My tomato's burst.

755
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,911
Could I have some bacon?

756
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,997
Want a tomato, Sam?

757
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,875
-What are you doing?!
-Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

758
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,640
-We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
-Put it out, you fools!

759
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:36,674
-Put it out!
-That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

760
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,438
Go!

761
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,113
Back, you devils!

762
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,349
Frodo!

763
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,069
Oh, Sam.

764
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,549
Strider!

765
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:50,479
-Help him, Strider.
-He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

766
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:56,590
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

767
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,989
Hurry!

768
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,988
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

769
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,997
Hold on, Frodo.

770
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,471
Gandalf!

771
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,952
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

772
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,793
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

773
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,232
Is he going to die?

774
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:59,116
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

775
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,709
-They're close.
-Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

776
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,319
-Athelas?
-Kingsfoil.

777
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,509
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

778
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,792
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

779
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:31,553
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

780
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,389
Frodo.

781
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,272
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

782
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,352
Hear my voice...

783
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,636
Come back to the light.

784
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,317
Who is she?

785
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,638
Frodo.

786
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:20,276
-She's an Elf.
-He's fading.

787
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,550
He's not going to last.

788
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,320
We must get him to my father.

789
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,753
-I've been looking for you for two days.
-Where are you taking him?

790
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:36,830
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

791
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,189
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.

792
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,992
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him

793
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,119
The Road is too dangerous.

794
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,435
What are they saying?

795
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,676
If I can get across the river...

796
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,348
...the power of my people
will protect him.

797
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,833
I do not fear them.

798
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,639
Arwen...

799
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,912
...ride hard. Don't look back.

800
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,912
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

801
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,474
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

802
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,834
If you want him, come and claim him.

803
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,909
No. No!

804
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,230
Frodo, no.

805
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,635
Frodo, don't give in.

806
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,751
Not now.

807
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,629
What grace is given me...

808
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,032
...let it pass to him.

809
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,310
Let him be spared.

810
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,876
Save him.

811
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:52,749
-Where am I?
-You are in the house of Elrond.

812
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:59,395
And it is 1 0:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

813
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,875
-Gandalf!
-Yes, I'm here.

814
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,432
And you're lucky to be here too.

815
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:13,914
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

816
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,079
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

817
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,789
What happened, Gandalf?

818
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:33,879
-Why didn't you meet us?
-I am sorry, Frodo.

819
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,072
I was delayed.

820
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:44,959
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

821
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,437
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

822
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,354
Embrace the power of the Ring...

823
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,354
...or embrace your own destruction!

824
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:05,269
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

825
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:09,314
Only one who can bend it to his will.

826
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:13,914
And he does not share power.

827
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,877
So you have chosen death.

828
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,189
Gandalf? What is it?

829
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,838
Nothing, Frodo.

830
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,311
Frodo!

831
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,915
-Sam.
-Bless you, you're awake!

832
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,759
Sam has hardly left your side.

833
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,030
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

834
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:03,315
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

835
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:08,196
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

836
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,437
-Bilbo!
-Hello, Frodo, my lad.

837
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,278
Bilbo.

838
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,757
''There and Back Again.

839
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,633
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''

840
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,990
-This is wonderful.
-I meant to go back...

841
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,949
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

842
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,590
...visit Lake-town...

843
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:25,076
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

844
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:30,190
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

845
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,512
I miss the Shire.

846
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,869
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

847
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,590
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

848
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,870
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

849
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,952
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

850
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,230
My dear boy.

851
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,988
-Now, what have I forgotten?
-Packed already?

852
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,478
No harm in being prepared.

853
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,114
-I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
-I do.

854
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:26,073
-More than anything.
-I did.

855
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,111
It's just....

856
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,348
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

857
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,075
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

858
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,431
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

859
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,278
Off home.

860
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,191
You are right, Sam.

861
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,919
We did what we set out to do.

862
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,914
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

863
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,110
I am ready to go home.

864
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,796
His strength returns.

865
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,472
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

866
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,429
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

867
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:15,189
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

868
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,631
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

869
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:24,039
-We can ask no more of Frodo.
-Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

870
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:28,711
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

871
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,559
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

872
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,832
Our list of allies grows thin.

873
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,233
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

874
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:41,910
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

875
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,475
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

876
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:49,151
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

877
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,635
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

878
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:55,953
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

879
01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:00,358
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

880
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,069
Gandalf...

881
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,794
...the Ring cannot stay here.

882
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,637
This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.

883
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,434
They must decide now how to end it.

884
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,870
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

885
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,956
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

886
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:47,029
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

887
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,319
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

888
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,278
Men?

889
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:57,192
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

890
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:01,632
The blood of Nûmenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

891
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,310
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

892
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,078
I was there, Gandalf.

893
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:10,439
I was there 3000 years ago...

894
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,269
... when Isildur took the Ring.

895
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:23,189
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

896
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,108
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

897
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:33,110
I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...

898
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:36,710
... where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

899
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,388
Cast it into the fire!

900
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,995
-Destroy it!
-No.

901
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,350
Isildur!

902
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:56,316
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

903
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:04,353
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

904
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:08,710
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

905
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:13,550
-They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
-There is one who could unite them.

906
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,957
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

907
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:22,235
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

908
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,476
He has chosen exile.

909
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,151
You are no Elf.

910
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,351
Men of the South are welcome here.

911
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,356
-Who are you?
-I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

912
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,433
Then we are here on common purpose...

913
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,193
...friend.

914
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,598
The shards of Narsil.

915
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:33,238
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

916
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,150
It's still sharp.

917
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,632
But no more than a broken heirloom.

918
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,272
Why do you fear the past?

919
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:24,274
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

920
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,756
You are not bound to his fate.

921
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:32,068
The same blood flows in my veins.

922
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,434
The same weakness.

923
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,679
Your time will come.

924
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:47,112
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

925
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,509
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

926
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:56,916
Not over you... not over me.

927
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,912
Do you remember when we first met?

928
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:18,677
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

929
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,589
Long years have passed.

930
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:26,471
You did not have the cares you carry now.

931
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,836
Do you remember what I told you?

932
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:38,154
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

933
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:44,875
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

934
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,797
And to that I hold.

935
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,470
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

936
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:55,355
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

937
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:07,110
I choose a mortal life.

938
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,473
-You cannot give me this.
-It is mine to give to whom I will...

939
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,994
...like my heart.

940
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:36,675
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

941
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,668
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

942
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:45,956
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

943
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:49,550
You will unite, or you will fall.

944
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:53,833
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

945
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:58,996
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

946
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,118
So it is true.

947
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,871
In a dream...

948
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:37,512
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

949
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,438
...but in the West
a pale light lingered.

950
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,918
A voice was crying:

951
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:44,958
''Your doom is near at hand.

952
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,559
Isildur's Bane is found.''

953
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,158
Isildur's Bane.

954
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,948
Boromir!

955
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:21,789
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

956
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,549
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

957
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,796
...for the Black Speech of Mordor...

958
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:29,359
...may yet be heard...

959
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:32,358
...in every corner of the West!

960
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,154
The Ring is altogether evil.

961
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,919
It is a gift.

962
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,471
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

963
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:42,076
Why not use this Ring?

964
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:44,919
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

965
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:49,272
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

966
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,670
...are your lands kept safe.

967
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:57,558
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

968
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:01,355
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

969
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:05,833
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

970
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:09,430
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

971
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,631
This is no mere Ranger.

972
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:16,075
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

973
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:19,358
You owe him your allegiance.

974
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,111
Aragorn.

975
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,513
This is Isildur's heir?

976
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,399
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

977
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:37,839
Sit down, Legolas.

978
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,719
Gondor has no king.

979
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,158
Gondor needs no king.

980
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:57,075
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

981
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:01,396
You have only one choice.

982
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,830
The Ring must be destroyed.

983
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,348
What are we waiting for?

984
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,872
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Glóin...

985
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:30,119
...by any craft that we here possess.

986
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:34,599
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

987
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,475
Only there can it be unmade.

988
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,988
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

989
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:46,955
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

990
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,791
One of you...

991
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,350
...must do this.

992
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:59,709
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

993
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,070
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

994
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:08,839
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

995
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:13,113
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

996
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,796
It is a barren wasteland...

997
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,436
...riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

998
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:23,315
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

999
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:27,638
Not with 1 0,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

1000
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:32,118
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

1001
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,788
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

1002
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,471
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1003
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:44,708
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

1004
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:49,029
Never trust an Elf!

1005
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:55,757
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1006
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,833
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1007
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,990
I will take it.

1008
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,314
I will take it.

1009
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,838
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1010
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,794
Though...

1011
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,518
...I do not know the way.

1012
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:51,598
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1013
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:55,031
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1014
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:59,032
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1015
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,034
...I will.

1016
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,355
You have my sword.

1017
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,071
And you have my bow.

1018
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,029
And my ax.

1019
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,638
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1020
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:28,075
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

1021
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,875
...then Gondor will see it done.

1022
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:37,911
-Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
-It is hardly possible to separate you...

1023
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:42,796
...even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

1024
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,191
We're coming too!

1025
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:49,793
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1026
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,231
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1027
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:54,788
...mission.

1028
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,399
Quest.

1029
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:57,829
Thing.

1030
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:02,234
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1031
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:05,551
Nine companions.

1032
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,032
So be it.

1033
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:12,272
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

1034
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,632
Great!

1035
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,030
Where are we going?

1036
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:53,754
She wanted to protect her child...

1037
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:59,149
she thought in Rivendell
you would be safe.

1038
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:04,596
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

1039
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,678
That you'd never escape your fate.

1040
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:10,670
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1041
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:14,834
...but only you have the power
to wield it.

1042
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,149
I do not want that power.

1043
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:20,954
I have never wanted it.

1044
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,668
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1045
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:31,270
My old sword! Sting.

1046
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:32,595
Here, take it. Take it.

1047
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:41,589
-It's so light.
-Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1048
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:46,273
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

1049
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:50,871
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1050
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:53,435
Here's a pretty thing.

1051
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,068
Mithril.

1052
01:42:55,840 --> 01:43:00,038
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1053
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:03,357
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1054
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:13,036
My old ring.

1055
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:17,994
I should very much like...

1056
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:22,079
...to hold it again, one last time.

1057
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:42,235
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1058
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:46,473
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1059
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:53,758
I'm sorry for everything.

1060
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:12,158
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1061
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,954
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1062
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:19,152
...nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1063
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:24,874
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1064
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:29,074
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1065
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:32,114
...and all Free Folk go with you.

1066
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:38,999
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1067
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:59,029
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1068
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,312
Left.

1069
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:21,912
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1070
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:25,715
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1071
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:29,310
From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.

1072
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:33,195
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1073
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:35,909
Move your feet.

1074
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,394
-You look good, Pippin.
-Thanks.

1075
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:38,953
Faster!

1076
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:43,869
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1077
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,719
...I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1078
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:50,158
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1079
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:54,469
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1080
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:59,800
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1081
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:09,795
Sorry!

1082
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:11,913
Get him!

1083
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:15,675
-For the Shire!
-Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1084
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,475
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1085
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,638
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1086
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,594
-What is that?
-Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1087
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,394
It's moving fast.

1088
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,710
Against the wind.

1089
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,476
-Crebain from Dunland!
-Hide!

1090
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:37,319
-Hurry!
-Take cover!

1091
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,998
Spies of Saruman.

1092
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,877
The passage south is being watched.

1093
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:19,157
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1094
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,918
Frodo!

1095
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,315
Boromir.

1096
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:57,559
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1097
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,752
...over so small a thing.

1098
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,717
Such a little thing.

1099
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,319
Boromir!

1100
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,480
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1101
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,876
As you wish.

1102
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,516
I care not.

1103
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:02,956
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

1104
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:07,551
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1105
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,633
If the mountain defeats you...

1106
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:16,118
... will you risk
a more dangerous road?

1107
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:30,758
There is a fell voice on the air.

1108
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,233
It's Saruman!

1109
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:46,271
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1110
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:48,232
No!

1111
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:53,712
We must get off the mountain!

1112
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:58,312
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1113
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:01,751
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1114
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:05,509
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1115
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:08,439
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1116
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:13,875
Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

1117
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,355
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1118
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:24,796
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm.

1119
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:29,396
Shadow and flame.

1120
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:35,239
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1121
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:41,756
We cannot stay here!

1122
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:44,599
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1123
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,392
Frodo?

1124
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:52,073
We will go through the mines.

1125
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:54,671
So be it.

1126
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,709
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1127
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:10,236
How is your shoulder?

1128
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:13,557
-Better than it was.
-And the Ring?

1129
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,469
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1130
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:20,718
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1131
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:24,835
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

1132
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,508
And, I fear, from within.

1133
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:33,999
-Who then do I trust?
-You must trust yourself.

1134
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,919
Trust your own strengths.

1135
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:39,554
-What do you mean?
-There are many powers in this world...

1136
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:41,716
...for good or for evil.

1137
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:44,115
Some are greater than I am.

1138
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:48,110
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1139
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:50,754
The walls...

1140
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,431
...of Moria.

1141
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:01,798
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1142
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,278
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1143
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,955
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1144
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:19,837
Well, let's see.

1145
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,399
Ithildin.

1146
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,231
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1147
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:42,633
It reads, ''The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1148
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:47,637
-Speak, friend, and enter.''
-What do you suppose that means?

1149
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:52,391
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1150
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:16,269
Nothing's happening.

1151
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,073
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

1152
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:29,993
...Men and Orcs.

1153
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:31,429
What are you going to do, then?

1154
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,796
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1155
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:35,917
And if that does not shatter them...

1156
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:38,680
...and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1157
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:42,190
...I will try to find the opening words.

1158
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,954
Mines are no place for a pony.

1159
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:01,153
-Even one so brave as Bill.
-Bye-bye, Bill.

1160
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:04,953
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1161
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:08,870
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1162
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:17,868
Do not disturb the water.

1163
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:19,877
Oh, it's useless.

1164
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:34,110
It's a riddle.

1165
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:39,752
''Speak 'friend' and enter.''

1166
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:42,918
What's the Elvish word for ''friend''?

1167
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:45,508
Mellon.

1168
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:07,516
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1169
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:13,432
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1170
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:17,838
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

1171
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:20,469
And they call it a mine.

1172
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:22,557
A mine!

1173
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:26,757
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1174
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:34,153
No....

1175
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,952
No!

1176
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:40,959
Goblins.

1177
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:48,838
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1178
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:52,308
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1179
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,275
-Frodo!
-Help!

1180
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:58,993
Strider!

1181
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:01,839
-Help!
-Get off him!

1182
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:03,029
Aragorn!

1183
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:14,029
Frodo!

1184
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:40,269
Into the mines!

1185
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:43,552
-Legolas!
-Into the cave!

1186
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:49,352
Run!

1187
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:08,996
We now have but one choice.

1188
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:13,876
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1189
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:15,997
Be on your guard.

1190
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:19,476
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

1191
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:23,070
...in the deep places of the world.

1192
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:34,474
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1193
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:38,355
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1194
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:25,795
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1195
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,275
...or jewels...

1196
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:31,392
...but mithril.

1197
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:53,676
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1198
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:57,674
-Oh, that was a kingly gift.
-Yes.

1199
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:59,677
I never told him...

1200
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:04,635
...but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

1201
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,118
Pippin.

1202
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:40,473
I have no memory of this place.

1203
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:43,793
-Are we lost?
-No.

1204
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,434
-I think we are.
-Gandalf's thinking.

1205
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:48,039
-Merry?
-What?

1206
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:50,071
I'm hungry.

1207
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:05,238
-There's something down there.
-It's Gollum.

1208
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:09,399
-Gollum?
-He's been following us for three days.

1209
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:13,593
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
-Escaped...

1210
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:15,838
...or was set loose.

1211
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:19,830
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1212
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:24,999
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1213
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:30,638
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1214
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:35,470
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1215
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:41,391
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

1216
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:44,993
Before it drove him mad.

1217
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:47,993
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1218
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:49,349
Pity?

1219
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:53,193
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1220
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:59,034
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1221
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:02,795
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1222
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:08,908
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1223
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:11,918
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1224
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:18,157
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1225
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:21,673
...before this is over.

1226
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:26,795
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1227
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:36,397
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1228
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:39,716
I wish none of this had happened.

1229
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:44,755
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1230
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:50,799
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1231
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:56,074
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1232
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:58,795
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1233
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:03,398
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1234
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:06,637
And that is an encouraging thought.

1235
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:13,151
It's that way.

1236
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:15,555
-He's remembered.
-No.

1237
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:19,389
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1238
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:24,594
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1239
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:42,793
Let me risk a little more light.

1240
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:49,231
Behold...

1241
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:54,668
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1242
02:04:57,040 --> 02:05:00,316
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1243
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:25,878
Gimli!

1244
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,558
No!

1245
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:40,077
Oh, no.

1246
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:43,034
No.

1247
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:51,951
''Here lies Balin...

1248
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,311
...son of Fundin...

1249
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:57,114
...Lord of Moria.''

1250
02:05:58,160 --> 02:05:59,752
He is dead, then.

1251
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:03,038
It's as I feared.

1252
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:23,318
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1253
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:28,036
''They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1254
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:31,548
We have barred the gates...

1255
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:34,555
...but cannot hold them for long.

1256
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:37,479
The ground shakes.

1257
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:39,393
Drums...

1258
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:42,991
...drums in the deep.

1259
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,356
We cannot get out.

1260
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:53,955
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1261
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:58,028
We cannot get out.

1262
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:02,751
They are coming.''

1263
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:45,792
Fool of a Took!

1264
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:49,789
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1265
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:16,398
Frodo!

1266
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:19,999
Orcs.

1267
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:28,631
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1268
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:37,312
They have a cave-troll.

1269
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:53,595
Let them come!

1270
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:57,470
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1271
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:13,319
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1272
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:19,512
Frodo!

1273
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:53,477
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1274
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:56,237
Frodo!

1275
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:41,357
Frodo!

1276
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:40,348
Oh, no.

1277
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:50,231
He's alive.

1278
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:55,433
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1279
02:13:55,640 --> 02:13:57,756
You should be dead.

1280
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:00,349
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1281
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:05,111
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1282
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:11,749
Mithril.

1283
02:14:14,440 --> 02:14:16,954
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1284
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,551
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1285
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,592
This way!

1286
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:50,958
What is this new devilry?

1287
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:09,033
A Balrog.

1288
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:12,352
A demon of the ancient world.

1289
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:16,789
This foe is beyond any of you.

1290
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:19,433
Run!

1291
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:27,913
Quickly!

1292
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:45,068
Gandalf.

1293
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:47,193
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1294
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:50,949
The bridge is near.

1295
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:56,879
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1296
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:26,472
Gandalf!

1297
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,194
Merry! Pippin!

1298
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:57,319
Sam!

1299
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:03,037
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1300
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:07,313
Not the beard!

1301
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,831
Steady.

1302
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:25,432
Hold on!

1303
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:46,789
Hang on!

1304
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,792
Lean forward!

1305
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:02,669
Steady.

1306
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:05,035
Come on!

1307
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:06,673
Now!

1308
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:24,912
Over the bridge!

1309
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:26,633
Fly!

1310
02:20:09,400 --> 02:20:11,356
You cannot pass!

1311
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:13,073
Gandalf!

1312
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:21,836
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1313
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:26,429
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

1314
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,877
Go back to the Shadow.

1315
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:49,678
You shall not pass!

1316
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:19,429
-No! No!
-Gandalf!

1317
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:29,155
Fly, you fools!

1318
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:35,190
No!

1319
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:43,150
Aragorn!

1320
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:40,793
Legolas, get them up.

1321
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:46,517
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1322
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:50,190
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1323
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:53,597
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1324
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:57,631
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1325
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:01,196
On your feet, Sam.

1326
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:02,953
Frodo?

1327
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:06,558
Frodo!

1328
02:23:56,920 --> 02:23:59,354
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1329
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:04,039
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1330
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:06,674
An Elf-witch...

1331
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:09,953
...of terrible power.

1332
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:12,596
All who look upon her...

1333
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:14,518
...fall under her spell.

1334
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:15,948
Frodo!

1335
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:20,076
And are never seen again.

1336
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:24,592
Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

1337
02:24:24,800 --> 02:24:28,349
You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.

1338
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:30,232
Mr. Frodo?

1339
02:24:35,320 --> 02:24:40,678
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1340
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:45,237
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1341
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:56,991
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1342
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:03,831
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.

1343
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:07,280
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.

1344
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:11,598
Aragorn of the Dunedain...

1345
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:13,553
you are known to us.

1346
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:16,550
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

1347
02:25:16,760 --> 02:25:18,557
Speak words we can all understand!

1348
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:23,151
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1349
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:25,834
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

1350
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:34,277
That was not so courteous.

1351
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:44,439
You bring great evil with you.

1352
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:48,236
You can go no further.

1353
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:26,634
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1354
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:29,551
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1355
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:34,197
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1356
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,992
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1357
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:42,676
You will follow me.

1358
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:55,797
Caras Galadhon.

1359
02:26:56,400 --> 02:26:59,198
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1360
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:04,838
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1361
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:23,678
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1362
02:28:24,320 --> 02:28:29,269
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1363
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:35,192
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1364
02:28:35,440 --> 02:28:37,158
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1365
02:28:37,360 --> 02:28:40,318
For I much desire to speak with him.

1366
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:43,193
I can no longer see him from afar.

1367
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:48,989
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

1368
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:51,595
He has fallen into Shadow.

1369
02:28:56,080 --> 02:29:00,392
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1370
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:05,549
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1371
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:09,471
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1372
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:14,637
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1373
02:29:15,240 --> 02:29:18,391
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1374
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:27,078
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

1375
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:29,510
...Gimli, son of Glóin.

1376
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:33,870
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1377
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:37,794
...and in all lands...

1378
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,356
...love is now mingled with grief.

1379
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:56,074
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1380
02:29:56,600 --> 02:29:59,478
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1381
02:30:02,320 --> 02:30:05,437
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1382
02:30:05,640 --> 02:30:08,598
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1383
02:30:09,320 --> 02:30:12,039
...to the ruin of all.

1384
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:21,797
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1385
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:27,831
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1386
02:30:28,240 --> 02:30:31,755
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1387
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:35,956
Tonight, you will sleep....

1388
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:39,516
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1389
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:42,638
...one who has seen the Eye!

1390
02:30:56,680 --> 02:30:59,148
A lament for Gandalf.

1391
02:31:06,120 --> 02:31:07,599
What do they say about him?

1392
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:10,354
I have not the heart to tell you.

1393
02:31:13,120 --> 02:31:15,270
For me, the grief is still too near.

1394
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:20,793
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1395
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,912
There should be a verse about them.

1396
02:31:27,320 --> 02:31:29,231
The finest rockets ever seen

1397
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:33,039
They burst in stars of blue and green

1398
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:38,914
Or after thunder, silver showers

1399
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:42,239
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1400
02:31:42,440 --> 02:31:46,194
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1401
02:31:56,440 --> 02:31:59,000
Take some rest.

1402
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:01,760
These borders are well-protected.

1403
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:04,394
I will find no rest here.

1404
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:09,998
I heard her voice inside my head.

1405
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:13,790
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1406
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:19,233
She said to me,
''Even now there is hope left.''

1407
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:23,279
But I cannot see it.

1408
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:26,949
It is long since we had any hope.

1409
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:38,756
My father is a noble man.

1410
02:32:39,520 --> 02:32:41,636
But his rule is failing...

1411
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:47,154
...and our people lose faith.

1412
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:51,876
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1413
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:55,470
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1414
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:01,078
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1415
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:03,591
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1416
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:07,475
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1417
02:33:08,120 --> 02:33:11,476
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1418
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:16,117
Have you ever been called home...

1419
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:20,074
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1420
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:23,797
I have seen the White City...

1421
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:25,553
...long ago.

1422
02:33:26,480 --> 02:33:31,235
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1423
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:34,958
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1424
02:33:35,400 --> 02:33:38,597
''The Lords of Gondor have returned.''

1425
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:45,429
Will you look into the mirror?

1426
02:34:45,640 --> 02:34:47,119
What will I see?

1427
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:52,190
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1428
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:54,832
For the mirror...

1429
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:57,474
...shows many things.

1430
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:02,635
Things that were...

1431
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:05,308
...things that are...

1432
02:35:06,040 --> 02:35:07,917
...and some things...

1433
02:35:11,360 --> 02:35:14,557
...that have not yet come to pass.

1434
02:36:33,720 --> 02:36:36,439
I know what it is you saw.

1435
02:36:38,840 --> 02:36:41,229
For it is also in my mind.

1436
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:46,839
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

1437
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:53,796
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1438
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:57,551
He will try to take the Ring.

1439
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:59,671
You know of whom I speak.

1440
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:05,111
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1441
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:08,915
If you ask it of me...

1442
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:12,238
... I will give you the One Ring.

1443
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:15,310
You offer it to me freely.

1444
02:37:19,720 --> 02:37:23,474
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1445
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:32,751
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1446
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:36,829
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1447
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:40,352
Treacherous as the sea!

1448
02:37:40,840 --> 02:37:45,550
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1449
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,275
All shall love me...

1450
02:37:48,480 --> 02:37:51,199
...and despair.

1451
02:38:04,720 --> 02:38:08,872
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1452
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:11,475
...and go into the West...

1453
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:15,958
-...and remain Galadriel.
-I cannot do this alone.

1454
02:38:19,440 --> 02:38:23,399
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1455
02:38:24,280 --> 02:38:25,713
...is to be alone.

1456
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:31,559
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

1457
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:33,273
And I am its keeper.

1458
02:38:36,360 --> 02:38:39,830
This task was appointed to you.

1459
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:43,593
And if you do not find a way...

1460
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:46,671
...no one will.

1461
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:50,077
Then I know what I must do.

1462
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:51,869
It's just...

1463
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,150
...I'm afraid to do it.

1464
02:39:00,520 --> 02:39:05,435
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1465
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:16,078
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1466
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:19,997
They were Elves once.

1467
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:24,317
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1468
02:39:24,520 --> 02:39:27,557
...tortured and mutilated.

1469
02:39:27,880 --> 02:39:32,954
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1470
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:34,992
And now...

1471
02:39:36,400 --> 02:39:38,197
...perfected.

1472
02:39:38,880 --> 02:39:41,917
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1473
02:39:43,800 --> 02:39:45,995
...whom do you serve?

1474
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:48,589
Saruman!

1475
02:40:08,600 --> 02:40:11,876
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1476
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:14,878
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1477
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:17,913
You will taste Man-flesh!

1478
02:40:22,760 --> 02:40:26,275
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1479
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:30,519
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1480
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:33,468
Kill the others.

1481
02:40:51,880 --> 02:40:57,113
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

1482
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:01,829
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1483
02:41:08,760 --> 02:41:10,318
Lembas.

1484
02:41:10,520 --> 02:41:12,078
Elvish waybread.

1485
02:41:14,480 --> 02:41:17,358
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1486
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:25,391
How many did you eat?

1487
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:27,192
Four.

1488
02:41:32,760 --> 02:41:35,228
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1489
02:41:35,440 --> 02:41:39,353
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.

1490
02:41:39,560 --> 02:41:41,949
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

1491
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:45,789
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

1492
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:50,869
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1493
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:01,668
You are being tracked.

1494
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:07,477
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.

1495
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:28,631
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1496
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:32,196
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1497
02:42:37,360 --> 02:42:39,669
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1498
02:42:39,880 --> 02:42:43,668
They have already seen service in war.

1499
02:42:43,880 --> 02:42:46,030
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1500
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:49,391
You will find your courage.

1501
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:53,077
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

1502
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:55,669
...Elven rope made of hithlain.

1503
02:42:55,880 --> 02:42:57,916
Thank you, my lady.

1504
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:02,877
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1505
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:11,918
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1506
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:14,156
Nothing.

1507
02:43:14,760 --> 02:43:17,957
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1508
02:43:18,560 --> 02:43:23,554
...for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1509
02:43:30,320 --> 02:43:31,799
Actually....

1510
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:33,558
There was one thing.

1511
02:43:34,360 --> 02:43:36,874
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

1512
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:39,753
Stupid to ask.

1513
02:43:42,200 --> 02:43:44,191
I have nothing greater to give...

1514
02:43:44,400 --> 02:43:47,836
...than the gift you already bear.

1515
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:50,029
For her love,

1516
02:43:51,280 --> 02:43:56,400
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar
will diminish.

1517
02:43:57,160 --> 02:44:00,311
I would have her leave these shores,

1518
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:04,598
and be with her people.

1519
02:44:06,520 --> 02:44:11,992
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

1520
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:15,192
That choice is yet before her.

1521
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:18,673
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1522
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:24,552
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1523
02:44:24,760 --> 02:44:28,912
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1524
02:44:35,880 --> 02:44:37,108
Farewell.

1525
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:44,071
There is much you have yet to do.

1526
02:44:50,320 --> 02:44:51,514
We shall not meet again...

1527
02:44:51,720 --> 02:44:53,039
Elessar.

1528
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:58,397
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1529
02:44:58,600 --> 02:45:01,876
I give you the light of Eärendil...

1530
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:04,830
...our most beloved star.

1531
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:17,832
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1532
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:21,999
... when all other lights go out.

1533
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:33,637
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1534
02:45:34,240 --> 02:45:38,358
...having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1535
02:45:39,080 --> 02:45:42,277
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1536
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:44,351
What was her gift?

1537
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:49,270
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1538
02:45:50,040 --> 02:45:52,793
She gave me three.

1539
02:47:30,800 --> 02:47:34,076
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1540
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:40,638
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1541
02:47:40,880 --> 02:47:43,917
But he's too clever a waterman.

1542
02:47:44,720 --> 02:47:47,837
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1543
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:50,156
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1544
02:47:50,360 --> 02:47:52,316
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1545
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:55,432
-No, Sam.
-You haven't eaten anything all day.

1546
02:47:55,640 --> 02:47:58,632
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1547
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:02,398
-Mr. Frodo--
-I'm all right.

1548
02:48:02,640 --> 02:48:03,755
But you're not.

1549
02:48:04,040 --> 02:48:06,395
I'm here to help you.

1550
02:48:06,600 --> 02:48:08,238
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1551
02:48:13,960 --> 02:48:16,599
You can't help me, Sam.

1552
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:20,312
Not this time.

1553
02:48:23,080 --> 02:48:25,116
Get some sleep.

1554
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:33,196
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1555
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:36,359
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1556
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,150
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1557
02:48:39,400 --> 02:48:42,153
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1558
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:44,511
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

1559
02:48:46,320 --> 02:48:48,993
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1560
02:48:49,200 --> 02:48:52,033
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1561
02:48:52,240 --> 02:48:55,437
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1562
02:48:55,640 --> 02:48:57,756
But you will not see that.

1563
02:48:58,080 --> 02:48:59,433
You are afraid!

1564
02:48:59,680 --> 02:49:02,148
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1565
02:49:02,400 --> 02:49:05,710
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1566
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:12,238
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1567
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:24,874
Frodo.

1568
02:49:26,680 --> 02:49:28,113
The Argonath.

1569
02:49:31,440 --> 02:49:34,989
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1570
02:49:35,720 --> 02:49:37,551
My kin.

1571
02:50:53,360 --> 02:50:55,476
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1572
02:50:55,680 --> 02:50:58,148
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1573
02:50:58,360 --> 02:51:01,670
-We approach Mordor from the North.
-Oh, yes?

1574
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:05,629
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1575
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:08,957
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1576
02:51:09,160 --> 02:51:12,118
And after that, it gets even better.

1577
02:51:12,520 --> 02:51:17,196
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1578
02:51:17,400 --> 02:51:18,753
That is our road.

1579
02:51:20,240 --> 02:51:23,277
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1580
02:51:23,480 --> 02:51:25,152
Recover my--

1581
02:51:28,040 --> 02:51:29,917
-We should leave now.
-No.

1582
02:51:30,120 --> 02:51:34,352
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1583
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:37,870
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1584
02:51:38,080 --> 02:51:41,914
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1585
02:51:42,400 --> 02:51:46,439
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1586
02:51:48,320 --> 02:51:53,075
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1587
02:51:53,560 --> 02:51:55,198
Where's Frodo?

1588
02:52:19,800 --> 02:52:21,631
None of us should wander alone.

1589
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:24,996
You, least of all.

1590
02:52:25,200 --> 02:52:27,555
So much depends on you.

1591
02:52:28,560 --> 02:52:30,437
Frodo?

1592
02:52:37,240 --> 02:52:39,708
I know why you seek solitude.

1593
02:52:40,400 --> 02:52:43,676
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1594
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:47,398
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1595
02:52:48,960 --> 02:52:51,520
There are other ways, Frodo.

1596
02:52:51,720 --> 02:52:55,395
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you would say.

1597
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:59,229
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1598
02:52:59,440 --> 02:53:02,398
Warning? Against what?

1599
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:04,636
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1600
02:53:04,840 --> 02:53:08,310
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1601
02:53:08,520 --> 02:53:12,149
-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.

1602
02:53:13,840 --> 02:53:17,037
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1603
02:53:18,560 --> 02:53:20,516
-If you would but lend me the Ring.
-No.

1604
02:53:21,720 --> 02:53:25,235
-Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
-You are not yourself.

1605
02:53:26,960 --> 02:53:30,157
What chance do you think you have?

1606
02:53:30,360 --> 02:53:34,831
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1607
02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:38,589
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1608
02:53:40,640 --> 02:53:42,631
You fool!

1609
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:46,628
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1610
02:53:46,840 --> 02:53:49,513
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1611
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:50,914
-Give it to me!
-No!

1612
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:52,872
-Give it to me!
-No.

1613
02:54:00,200 --> 02:54:02,156
I see your mind.

1614
02:54:02,360 --> 02:54:05,193
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1615
02:54:05,400 --> 02:54:07,197
You will betray us!

1616
02:54:07,400 --> 02:54:10,472
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1617
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:14,395
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1618
02:54:21,160 --> 02:54:22,639
Frodo?

1619
02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:28,273
Frodo.

1620
02:54:32,040 --> 02:54:33,996
What have I done?

1621
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:35,838
Please, Frodo.

1622
02:54:36,040 --> 02:54:38,600
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1623
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:26,553
Frodo?

1624
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:30,718
-It has taken Boromir.
-Where is the Ring?

1625
02:55:30,920 --> 02:55:32,638
Stay away!

1626
02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:34,553
Frodo!

1627
02:55:36,720 --> 02:55:40,395
-I swore to protect you.
-Can you protect me from yourself?

1628
02:55:49,680 --> 02:55:52,069
Would you destroy it?

1629
02:55:56,840 --> 02:55:58,717
Aragorn.

1630
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,230
Aragorn.

1631
02:56:05,960 --> 02:56:07,757
Elessar.

1632
02:56:15,080 --> 02:56:18,311
I would have gone with you to the end.

1633
02:56:18,960 --> 02:56:21,679
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1634
02:56:24,880 --> 02:56:25,995
I know.

1635
02:56:28,360 --> 02:56:33,593
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1636
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:38,838
Go, Frodo!

1637
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:43,153
Run.

1638
02:56:43,400 --> 02:56:44,992
Run!

1639
02:57:08,560 --> 02:57:10,152
Mr. Frodo!

1640
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:20,758
Find the halfling!

1641
02:57:22,320 --> 02:57:24,754
Find the halfling!

1642
02:57:28,080 --> 02:57:29,672
Elendil!

1643
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:37,399
Aragorn, go!

1644
02:57:58,240 --> 02:57:59,468
Frodo!

1645
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:01,598
Hide here. Quick!

1646
02:58:02,200 --> 02:58:03,599
Come on!

1647
02:58:05,960 --> 02:58:07,916
What's he doing?

1648
02:58:11,960 --> 02:58:13,871
He's leaving.

1649
02:58:18,480 --> 02:58:21,278
-No!
-Pippin!

1650
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,230
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1651
02:58:28,760 --> 02:58:31,752
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Over here!

1652
02:58:32,120 --> 02:58:33,678
-Over here!
-This way!

1653
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:46,310
-It's working!
-I know it's working! Run!

1654
02:59:39,400 --> 02:59:42,358
-The horn of Gondor.
-Boromir.

1655
03:00:23,680 --> 03:00:24,749
Run!

1656
03:03:47,680 --> 03:03:49,238
No.

1657
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,912
-They took the little ones.
-Hold still.

1658
03:03:56,160 --> 03:03:58,116
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1659
03:03:59,920 --> 03:04:01,319
I let Frodo go.

1660
03:04:01,960 --> 03:04:04,474
Then you did what I could not.

1661
03:04:05,440 --> 03:04:08,591
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1662
03:04:09,120 --> 03:04:13,193
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.
-Forgive me.

1663
03:04:13,400 --> 03:04:15,595
I did not see it.

1664
03:04:15,800 --> 03:04:18,872
-I have failed you all.
-No, Boromir.

1665
03:04:19,280 --> 03:04:21,714
You fought bravely.

1666
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,560
You have kept your honor.

1667
03:04:25,160 --> 03:04:26,957
Leave it.

1668
03:04:27,280 --> 03:04:29,271
It is over.

1669
03:04:30,440 --> 03:04:35,434
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1670
03:04:35,880 --> 03:04:38,758
...and my city to ruin.

1671
03:04:42,640 --> 03:04:45,234
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1672
03:04:45,440 --> 03:04:49,274
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1673
03:04:50,240 --> 03:04:52,629
...nor our people fail.

1674
03:04:53,560 --> 03:04:54,879
Our people.

1675
03:04:58,560 --> 03:05:00,551
Our people.

1676
03:05:21,440 --> 03:05:24,318
I would have followed you, my brother.

1677
03:05:25,800 --> 03:05:27,711
My captain.

1678
03:05:30,240 --> 03:05:32,071
My king.

1679
03:05:50,920 --> 03:05:53,070
Be at peace...

1680
03:05:53,440 --> 03:05:55,351
...son of Gondor.

1681
03:06:11,160 --> 03:06:14,357
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1682
03:06:14,840 --> 03:06:17,718
But he will not return.

1683
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:41,911
Frodo!

1684
03:07:00,560 --> 03:07:03,711
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1685
03:07:04,920 --> 03:07:07,798
I wish none of this had happened.

1686
03:07:10,640 --> 03:07:13,279
So do all who live
to see such times...

1687
03:07:13,480 --> 03:07:16,790
...but that is not for them to decide.

1688
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,514
All you have to decide...

1689
03:07:19,720 --> 03:07:24,271
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1690
03:07:51,920 --> 03:07:53,911
Frodo, no!

1691
03:07:54,440 --> 03:07:55,668
Frodo!

1692
03:07:56,440 --> 03:07:59,000
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.

1693
03:08:02,400 --> 03:08:04,277
Go back, Sam!

1694
03:08:04,760 --> 03:08:08,196
-I'm going to Mordor alone.
-Of course you are.

1695
03:08:08,400 --> 03:08:11,119
And I'm coming with you!

1696
03:08:11,600 --> 03:08:13,909
You can't swim!

1697
03:08:17,560 --> 03:08:19,198
Sam!

1698
03:08:24,560 --> 03:08:25,834
Sam!

1699
03:09:05,080 --> 03:09:07,674
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1700
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:12,152
A promise:
''Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee.''

1701
03:09:13,240 --> 03:09:15,754
And I don't mean to.

1702
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:18,070
I don't mean to.

1703
03:09:19,680 --> 03:09:21,432
Sam.

1704
03:09:35,720 --> 03:09:37,312
Come on.

1705
03:10:04,600 --> 03:10:08,957
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1706
03:10:23,240 --> 03:10:28,030
-You mean not to follow them.
-Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1707
03:10:31,320 --> 03:10:35,996
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1708
03:10:47,360 --> 03:10:50,397
Not if we hold true to each other.

1709
03:10:51,720 --> 03:10:55,998
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1710
03:10:56,960 --> 03:11:01,988
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1711
03:11:03,240 --> 03:11:05,151
We travel light.

1712
03:11:05,360 --> 03:11:07,191
Let us hunt some Orc.

1713
03:11:10,040 --> 03:11:11,996
Yes!

1714
03:11:30,200 --> 03:11:31,599
Mordor.

1715
03:11:32,200 --> 03:11:35,431
I hope the others find a safer road.

1716
03:11:36,320 --> 03:11:38,788
Strider will look after them.

1717
03:11:39,680 --> 03:11:42,911
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1718
03:11:43,240 --> 03:11:45,549
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1719
03:11:45,760 --> 03:11:47,273
We may.

1720
03:11:49,240 --> 03:11:50,275
Sam...

1721
03:11:53,720 --> 03:11:56,234
...I'm glad you are with me.

1722
03:38:41,160 --> 03:38:42,149
