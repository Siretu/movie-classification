1

2
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,156
What the hell?

3
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,159
Goddamn son of a bitch...

4
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,883
What the hell?

5
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,773
- Wow.
- Hey! My turn!

6
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,280
Come on.

7
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,327
What's wrong with this picture?

8
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,753
Nice night for a walk.

9
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,801
Nice night for a walk.

10
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,888
Wash day tomorrow. Nothing clean.

11
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,306
Right?

12
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,933
Nothing clean. Right.

13
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,103
I think this guy's a couple cans
short of a six-pack.

14
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,021
Your clothes.

15
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,941
Give them to me. Now.

16
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,568
Fuck you, asshole!

17
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,934
Hey, sugar. How about it?

18
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:37,897
Yeah, I don't have to put up
with that bullshit, man.

19
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,317
She's always after me.

20
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,384
Hey, buddy. Did you just see
a real bright light?

21
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,429
See that guy?

22
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,139
- Hold it there!
- He's rabbiting.

23
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,766
Hey, hold it!

24
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,393
Go!

25
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,895
That son of a bitch...

26
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,522
...took my pants!

27
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,067
What day is it? The date!

28
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,485
Twelfth. May.

29
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,320
- Thursday.
- What year?

30
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,406
What?

31
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,836
He's got my gun. Let's go!

32
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,222
Guard it for me, Big Buns.

33
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,436
Hi. I'm late.

34
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,480
So am I.

35
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,192
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

36
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,034
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.

37
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,371
- Who gets the burlybeef?
- I ordered barbequed beef.

38
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,540
- I got it without fries.
- He gets beef.

39
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,874
Mine's chili beef.

40
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,043
- Who gets the burlybeef?
- Miss?

41
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,713
- We're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

42
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,381
Oh, good heavens!

43
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,383
Oh, I'm so sorry!

44
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,722
This isn't real leather, is it?

45
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,103
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

46
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,400
Look at it this way:
In 100 years, who's gonna care?

47
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,785
The 12-gauge auto loader.

48
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,289
That's Italian.

49
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,750
You can go pump or auto.

50
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,420
The.45 long slide
with laser sighting.

51
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,965
They're brand new. Just got them in.
That's a good gun.

52
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:05,386
The beam comes on, you put the red
dot where you want the bullet to go.

53
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,096
You can't miss.

54
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,099
Anything else?

55
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,894
A phased plasma rifle
in the 40 watt range.

56
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,771
Just what you see, pal.

57
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,273
The Uzi nine millimeter.

58
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,943
You know your weapons, buddy.

59
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,446
Any one of these is ideal
for home defense.

60
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,157
So...

61
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,742
...which will it be?

62
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,910
All.

63
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,329
I may close early today.

64
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,664
There's a 15-day wait
on the handguns...

65
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,833
...but the rifles you can take now.

66
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,835
You can't do that.

67
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,129
Wrong.

68
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,323
Hi, baby.

69
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,783
Yeah, it's me.

70
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,912
I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

71
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,665
I don't care! Come get me. What-!

72
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,416
Mort?

73
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,462
Hey, man. You got
a serious attitude problem.

74
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,173
Mort, where are you?

75
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,509
Come on, what are you doing?

76
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,558
Sarah Connor?

77
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:16,893
Yes?

78
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,074
I'm on my break.
Carla's got my station.

79
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,745
Sarah, come here! It's about you!
I mean, sort of.

80
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,625
It's incredible.
You won't believe this.

81
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,920
- Sit down. You're gonna love this!
- What?

82
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,589
- has been compiled
from several witnesses.

83
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,009
Once again, Sarah Connor, 36,
mother of two...

84
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,720
...shot to death
in her home this afternoon.

85
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,680
You're dead, honey.

86
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,085
- if you're into sound,
for the greatest sound around...

87
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,504
...come into Bob's Stereo.

88
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,634
We've got woofers, tweeters, and
digital audio and compact laser discs.

89
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:22,430
We've got graphic equalizers
and sound balancers that adjust-

90
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,163
Sorry.

91
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,676
Hello?

92
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,264
First, I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse, one by one.

93
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:09,852
Then, run my tongue down your neck
to your bare, gleaming breasts.

94
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,395
Then, slowly...

95
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,858
...slowly pull yourjeans off,
inch by inch.

96
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,527
Ginger, it's Matt.

97
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,821
And lick your belly in circles,
further...

98
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,823
...and further down.

99
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,617
Then, pull your panties off...

100
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,202
...with my teeth.

101
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,578
Who is this?

102
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,165
Oh, God. Sarah?

103
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,336
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.

104
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,047
I thought you were-
Can I talk to Ginger?

105
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,673
Sure, Bunky.

106
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,761
It's the creep.

107
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:50,226
First, I'll rip the buttons
off your blouse, one by one...

108
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,021
- Calm down.
- You fucking pigs!

109
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,899
Wait till I get my hands on you!
Get off me!

110
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,567
Sit down, fella.

111
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,402
Ed!

112
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,573
- What do you got?
- Dead girl.

113
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,075
I can see that.

114
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,955
Sarah Ann Connors, secretary, 35,
shot six times at less than 10 feet.

115
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,333
- Large caliber weapon-
- You know, these work.

116
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,420
- What's this?
- Dead girl Two.

117
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,382
Sent over from the Valley division
this afternoon.

118
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,719
I'm sure there's a point
to all of this.

119
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,471
Look at the name, Ed.

120
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,765
"Sarah Louise...

121
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,059
...Connor. " Is this right?

122
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,062
You're kidding me.

123
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,773
The press will be
short-stroking it all over.

124
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,401
A one-day pattern killer.

125
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,278
I hate the weird ones.

126
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,367
So...

127
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,288
Better than mortal man deserves.

128
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,298
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately.

129
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,968
- Did you check messages?
- I thought you did.

130
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,766
Hi, Sarah. This is your mom.

131
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,810
There you are, young man.

132
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,396
You mind your mother.

133
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,315
Bye.

134
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,152
Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.

135
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,822
Something's come up and
I won't be able to make it tonight.

136
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,324
I just can't get out of it.

137
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,492
Sorry. I'll make it up to you.

138
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,162
Call you in a day or so, okay?
Sorry. Bye.

139
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,750
That bum.
So what if he has a Porsche.

140
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:42,171
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for chrissake!

141
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,798
I'll live.

142
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,176
I'll break his kneecaps.

143
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,348
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

144
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,559
God... It's disgusting.

145
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,104
I'm gonna go to a movie.

146
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,482
- You and Matt have a good time.
- We will.

147
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,484
- You too!
- Okay.

148
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,782
Damn it, Matt!

149
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,923
Oh, shit.

150
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:12,761
Are you aware the killings occurred in
the same order as in the phone book?

151
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,097
What can I tell you guys?
No comment.

152
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,558
But lieutenant,
we've got two murders-

153
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,946
That coffee's two hours cold.

154
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,782
And I put a cigarette out in it.

155
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:38,120
- Did you reach the next girl?
- I keep getting an answering machine.

156
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:39,663
- Send a unit.
- I did.

157
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,957
No answer and
the manager's not home.

158
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,001
- Call her.
- I just called her.

159
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,878
Call her again.

160
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,047
Give me a cigarette.

161
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,767
Hi, there.

162
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,228
Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

163
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,523
But don't be shy.
Machines need love too.

164
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,901
So talk to it.
And Ginger, that's me...

165
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,945
...or Sarah will get back to you.
Wait for the beep.

166
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,823
Same shit.

167
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:19,995
I can hear it now. He'll be called
the goddamn "Phone Book Killer. "

168
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,664
I hate these press cases.

169
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,959
Especially the weird press cases.

170
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,753
Where you going?

171
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,882
Make a statement. Make these
jackals work for us for a change.

172
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,259
If I can get on the tube by 11:00...

173
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,637
...maybe she'll call us.

174
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,013
Well?

175
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,682
- How do I look?
- Like shit, boss.

176
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,768
Your mama.

177
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,020
This just in.

178
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:49,191
Police have announced the name
of the second murder victim...

179
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,693
...which took place today.

180
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:55,280
Incredibly, the names of the victims
are virtually identical.

181
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,991
7wo hours ago, 36-year-old
Sarah Ann Connor...

182
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,536
...was found dead in her apartment.

183
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,955
- Change this.
- Sarah Louise Connor...

184
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,373
Don't touch it!

185
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,625
...was slain earlier in her home.

186
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,002
Police are refusing to speculate...

187
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,879
...on the similarities...

188
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:15,551
...and no other connection between
them has been established as of yet.

189
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,221
We'll have more on this
late-breaking story as it comes in.

190
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,440
- You got a phone?
- It's in the back!

191
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,275
Four-fifty!

192
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,359
You've reached the LAPD
emergency number.

193
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,902
All our lines are busy.

194
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,406
If you need a police car sent out
to you, stay on the line.

195
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:46,994
2-11 in progress at Bob's Liquor,
corner of 3rd and Tavern.

196
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,638
Shoo! Go on!

197
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,766
I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

198
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,990
Don't make me bust you up!

199
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,678
Hi, there.

200
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,721
Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

201
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,016
But don't be shy.
Machines need love too.

202
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,436
So talk to it.
And Ginger, that's me...

203
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,814
...or Sarah, will get back to you.
Wait for the beep.

204
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,192
Ginger! It's Sarah! Pick up!

205
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,196
I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called TechNoir.

206
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,198
I'm really scared.

207
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,701
I think there's somebody after me.

208
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,704
I hope you play this back soon.

209
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,456
I need you to come and pick me up.

210
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,461
The police keep transferring me.
I'll give them another try.

211
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:46,882
The number here is 666-9176.

212
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,925
Call me. I need your help.

213
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,277
It's her.

214
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,781
- Sarah Connor? Lieutenant Traxler.
- Look...

215
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,284
...don't put me on hold
or transfer me!

216
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:18,747
- I won't. Tell me where you are.
- A bar called TechNoir.

217
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,750
I know it. It's on Pico.
Are you all right?

218
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:25,128
Yeah, but I think there's a guy
following me.

219
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:29,591
Listen carefully. You're in a public
place. You're safe till we get there.

220
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,761
But stay visible.
Don't go outside or to the restroom.

221
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,722
- I'll have a car there in a minute.
- Okay.

222
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,082
Hey, that guy didn't pay!

223
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,535
Come with me if you wanna live.

224
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,629
Come on!

225
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,579
This is 1-L 19.
I got a hit-and-run felony.

226
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,958
Suspect vehicle late-model grey Ford,
headed westbound on 7th.

227
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,211
He's really moving.

228
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:20,507
I'll need an ambulance
at 7th and Broadway right now.

229
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,218
Hold it!

230
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,724
All units watch
for a late-model grey Ford...

231
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,894
...last seen westbound
on 7th and Broadway.

232
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:40,944
Hold on.

233
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,581
Are you injured?

234
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,543
Are you shot?

235
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,633
Do exactly what I say!

236
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,593
Exactly!

237
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,136
Don't move unless I say.

238
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,264
Don't make a sound unless I say.

239
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,140
Do you understand?

240
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,726
- Do you understand?!
- Yes!

241
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,937
Please, don't hurt me.

242
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,164
I'm here to help you.

243
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,375
I'm Reese. Sergeant, Tech-Com.

244
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,128
DN 38416, assigned to protect you.

245
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,879
You're targeted for termination.

246
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,806
Intercept at National and Olympic.
Come in, 1-L 19.

247
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:56,477
This is 1-L 19. Westbound on
Olympic, approaching Overland.

248
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,984
This is a mistake.

249
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,237
- I didn't do anything.
- No, but you will.

250
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,489
It's very important that you live.

251
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:12,035
This isn't true. How could
that man get up after you-

252
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,494
It's not a man.

253
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,997
A machine. A Terminator.

254
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,708
Cyberdyne Systems model 101.

255
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,635
A machine?

256
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,887
Like a robot?

257
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,597
Not a robot.

258
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,516
A cyborg. Cybernetic organism.

259
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,352
No, he was bleeding.

260
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,519
Just a second.

261
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,941
Get your head down!

262
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,070
All right, listen.

263
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:32,865
The Terminator's an infiltration unit.
Part man, part machine.

264
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:36,077
Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy
combat chassis.

265
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,831
Microprocessor controlled.
Fully armored. Very tough.

266
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,291
But outside, it's living human tissue.

267
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,921
Flesh, skin, hair, blood.
Grown for the cyborgs.

268
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,965
- What do you want from me?
- Pay attention!

269
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,008
I gotta ditch this car.

270
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,810
The 600 series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

271
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,354
But these are new.
They look human.

272
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:07,400
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

273
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,945
I had to wait till he moved on you
before I could zero him.

274
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,655
Look...

275
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,782
...I am not stupid, you know.

276
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,909
They cannot make
things like that yet.

277
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,953
Not yet.

278
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,955
Not for about 40 years.

279
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,626
Are you saying it's from the future?

280
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,463
One possible future.

281
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,966
From your point of view.
I don't know tech stuff.

282
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,553
Then you're from the future too,
right?

283
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,514
- Right.
- Right.

284
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,940
Cyborgs don't feel pain.

285
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,192
I do.

286
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,486
Don't do that again.

287
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,821
- Just let me go.
- Listen...

288
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,448
...and understand!

289
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,785
That terminator is out there.

290
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,078
It can't be bargained with.

291
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,080
It can't be reasoned with.

292
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,542
It doesn't feel pity or remorse...

293
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:10,421
...or fear. And it absolutely
will not stop...

294
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,215
...ever...

295
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,008
...until you are dead.

296
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,020
Can you stop it?

297
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,692
I don't know.

298
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,738
With these weapons, I don't know.

299
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,048
All units, grey Ford...

300
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,634
...suspect vehicle found
in a parking structure...

301
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,302
...at 4th and Broadway.

302
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,726
Location, lower level.

303
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:12,567
Suspect described as male, white,
six feet, 26 years, green overcoat.

304
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,777
Last seen on...

305
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,596
Reese?

306
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,432
Why me?

307
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,144
Why does it want me?

308
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,028
There was a nuclear war.

309
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,073
A few years from now...

310
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,036
...all this...

311
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,456
...this whole place, everything...

312
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,791
...it's gone.

313
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,711
Just gone.

314
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,505
There were survivors...

315
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:18,049
...here...

316
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,634
...there.

317
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,638
Nobody even knew who started it.

318
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,101
It was the machines, Sarah.

319
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,395
I don't understand.

320
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,357
Defense network computers.

321
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,692
New.

322
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,361
Powerful.

323
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,988
Hooked into everything.

324
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,157
Trusted to run it all.

325
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,327
They say it got smart.

326
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,537
A new order of intelligence.

327
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:53,584
It saw all people as a threat,
not just those on the other side.

328
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,631
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

329
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,842
Extermination.

330
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,566
Did you see this war?

331
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:30,913
No.

332
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,374
I grew up after.

333
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,917
In the ruins.

334
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,460
Starving.

335
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,087
Hiding from H-Ks.

336
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,089
- H-Ks?
- Hunter-Killers.

337
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,677
Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

338
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,971
Most of us were rounded up.

339
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:50,057
Put in camps for orderly disposal.

340
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,936
This is burned in by laser scanner.

341
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,067
Some of us were kept alive...

342
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,069
...to work...

343
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,697
...loading bodies.

344
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,451
The disposal units
ran night and day.

345
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,704
We were that close
to going out forever.

346
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,001
But there was one man...

347
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:20,546
...who taught us to fight,
to storm the wire of the camps.

348
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:24,425
To smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

349
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,596
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

350
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,389
His name is Connor.

351
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,059
John Connor.

352
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,560
Your son.

353
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,189
Your unborn son.

354
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:29,049
Drive!

355
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,475
Reese!

356
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,120
No, Reese! No!

357
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,164
No! They'll kill you.

358
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,125
You in the Cadillac!
Let me see your hands. Now.

359
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,296
Get out of the car!

360
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,260
Drop to your knees!

361
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,762
Out of the car.

362
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,472
Drop to the ground!

363
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:23,020
All units PC-907.
Suspect is in custody.

364
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,813
Cancel fu·her assistance.

365
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,710
Sarah...

366
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,630
...try to drink some of this.

367
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,426
Are you sure it's them?

368
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,388
I mean, maybe I should
look at the bodies.

369
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,182
They've been identified.
There's no doubt.

370
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,642
Oh, God...

371
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,980
Ginger!

372
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:08,899
Oh, kiddo.

373
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,651
Sarah...

374
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,404
...this is Doctor Silberman.

375
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:14,655
Hi, Sarah.

376
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:17,491
I want you to tell him
everything Reese told you.

377
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,995
- Do you feel up to that?
- Yeah. I guess so.

378
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,206
You're a doctor?

379
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,750
Criminal psychologist.

380
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,210
Is Reese crazy?

381
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:31,422
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

382
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,342
So, you're a soldier.

383
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,386
Fighting for whom?

384
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,098
With the 132nd, under Perry.

385
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,600
From '21 to '27.

386
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,060
That's the year...

387
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,645
...2·27p

388
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,896
That's right.

389
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:14,066
- Then I was assigned to Recon...
- This is great.

390
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,692
...under John Connor.

391
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,946
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defense system built-

392
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:21,407
Damn. Sorry.

393
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,910
Built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

394
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,537
I see.

395
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:28,330
And this...

396
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:33,127
...computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy.

397
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,422
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

398
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,882
Sort of retroactive abortion?

399
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:44,179
Silberman cracks me up. He had
a guy in here that burned his Afghan.

400
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,390
- He screwed it first-
- Shut up.

401
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,641
Why didn't it...

402
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:51,645
...kill Connor then? Why this
scheme with the Terminator?

403
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,272
It had no choice.

404
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,108
Their defense grid was smashed.

405
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,568
We'd won.

406
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,612
Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

407
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:03,657
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

408
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:08,662
Is that when you captured
the lab and found- What is it?

409
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,998
The time displacement equipment?

410
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,499
That's right.

411
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,169
The Terminator
had already gone through.

412
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,630
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.

413
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,424
How do you get back?

414
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,885
I can't.

415
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,430
Nobody goes home.

416
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,267
Nobody else comes through.

417
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,519
It's just him...

418
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:34,188
...and me.

419
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,960
It's just him...

420
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,128
...and me.

421
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,675
Why didn't you bring any weapons?

422
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,261
Something more advanced?

423
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,055
Don't you have ray guns?

424
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:33,473
Ray guns.

425
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,101
Show me a piece
of future technology.

426
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,644
You go naked.

427
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:40,814
Something about the field
generated by a living organism.

428
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:42,858
- Nothing dead will go.
- Why?

429
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:46,028
- I didn't build the fucking thing!
- Okay, okay.

430
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,197
But this cyborg, if it's metal-

431
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,033
Surrounded by living tissue!

432
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,659
Oh, right. Right.

433
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,829
This is great stuff.
I could make a career out of him.

434
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,749
See how clever this is?
It doesn't require proof.

435
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:02,836
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,
but this is brilliant!

436
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,757
Why were
the other two women killed?

437
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,759
Most records were lost in the war.

438
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,512
Skynet knew almost nothing about
Connor's mother: Her full name...

439
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,140
...where she lived.
They just knew the city.

440
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,976
That Terminator
was just being systematic.

441
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,311
Let's go back to-

442
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,229
You have heard enough!

443
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,524
I've answered your questions,
now I have to see Sarah!

444
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:25,943
That's not up to me.

445
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,737
- Then why am I talking to you?
- Because-

446
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,656
- Who's in authority?
- Please-

447
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,366
Shut up!

448
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,494
You still don't get it, do you?

449
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,204
He'll find her!

450
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,039
That's what he does!

451
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,999
That's all he does!

452
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,918
You can't stop him!

453
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,713
He'll wade through you, reach down
her throat and pull her heart out!

454
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,048
Doc.

455
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,383
Let go of me!

456
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,930
Sorry.

457
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,103
So Reese is crazy?

458
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,313
In technical terminology...

459
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,731
...he's a loon.

460
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,902
Sarah, this is what they call
body armor.

461
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:10,946
Our TAC guys wear these.

462
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:15,742
Stop a 12-gauge round. This other
individual must've been wearing one.

463
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,536
Feel that. Go ahead.

464
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,248
What about punching
the windshield?

465
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,208
He was probably on PCP.

466
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,253
If he broke his hand,
he wouldn't feel it for hours.

467
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,672
- There was this guy- See this?
- Here.

468
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,090
Thank you.

469
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:34,636
There's a couch. Stretch out
and try to sleep.

470
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:37,139
Be an hour before your mom
gets here from Big Bear.

471
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,849
I can't sleep.

472
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,600
Try.

473
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:45,230
It may not look it, but
that couch is very comfortable.

474
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,316
You'll be perfectly safe.

475
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,194
We got 30 cops in this building.

476
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,238
Thank you.

477
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,288
- Good night.
- Good night.

478
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:19,097
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here.

479
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:22,059
- Could I see her?
- No, she's making a statement.

480
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:23,268
Where is she?

481
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,606
It may take a while.
You want to wait, there's a bench.

482
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,285
I'll be back.

483
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:08,688
What the hell was that?

484
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:19,950
Gunshots!

485
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,043
- Is it a terrorist?
- Let's go!

486
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,300
Stay here.

487
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,650
- Let's get out of here!
- Come on!

488
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,114
Move it, move it, move it!

489
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,659
I got him!

490
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:18,633
Watch him!

491
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,114
- Automatic weapons!
- Come on, let's go!

492
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:11,603
Fire! Fire!

493
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:27,702
Ed.

494
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,899
Sarah!

495
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:00,860
Reese!

496
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:05,991
This way!

497
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,491
KFLB news time, 4:36.

498
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,579
In the top story,
the largest law enforcement...

499
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:55,749
...mobilization in California
history is underway.

500
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:59,836
Police in five southern counties
are in a massive manhunt-

501
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:04,799
Take this.

502
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,929
All right, let's get this
off the road.

503
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:42,921
You cold?

504
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,631
Freezing.

505
01:04:58,186 --> 01:04:59,437
Reese...

506
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,649
...you got a first name?

507
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:04,734
Kyle.

508
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:06,694
Kyle...

509
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,781
...what's it like
when you go through time?

510
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,993
White light.

511
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,164
Pain.

512
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,627
It's like being born, maybe.

513
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:25,088
Oh, my God!

514
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:28,341
I caught one back there.

515
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,219
You mean you got shot?

516
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:32,679
It's not bad.

517
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:37,142
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It's okay. Forget it.

518
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,019
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy?

519
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:42,188
Take this off.

520
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,702
Jesus!

521
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,663
See, it passed right through
the meat.

522
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:00,874
This is gonna make me puke.

523
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,544
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?

524
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,754
I don't know. Anything. Just talk.

525
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,882
Tell me about my son.

526
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,634
He's about my height.

527
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,432
He has your eyes.

528
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,312
What's he like?

529
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,731
You trust him.

530
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,108
He's got a strength.

531
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,361
I'd die for John Connor.

532
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,743
At least now I know
what to name him.

533
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,704
Don't suppose you know
who the father is...

534
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:42,582
...so I won't tell him to get lost
when I meet him.

535
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:45,293
John never said much about him.

536
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,004
- I know he dies before the war-
- Wait!

537
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,175
I don't want to know.

538
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,262
So was it John that sent you here?

539
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:58,431
I volunteered.

540
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:00,934
Why?

541
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,561
It was a chance to meet the legend.

542
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,022
Sarah Connor.

543
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,900
Who taught her son to fight...

544
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:11,277
...organize...

545
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,571
...prepare, from when he was a kid.

546
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,407
When you were in hiding
before the war.

547
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:23,289
You're talking about things I
haven't done yet in the past tense.

548
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:25,667
It's driving me crazy!

549
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:31,673
Are you sure
you have the right person?

550
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,675
I'm sure.

551
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:38,054
Come on, do I look
like the mother of the future?

552
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,474
I mean, am I tough?

553
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:45,186
Organized?
I can't even balance my checkbook!

554
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:51,734
Look, I didn't ask for this honor
and I don't want it!

555
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,569
Any of it!

556
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:59,033
Your son gave me a message
to give to you.

557
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:00,660
Made me memorize it.

558
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,831
"Thank you for your courage
through the dark years.

559
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,585
I can't help you with what you face,
except to say the future is not set.

560
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,255
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

561
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:14,841
You must survive,
or I will never exist. "

562
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,594
That's all.

563
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,098
It's a good field-dressing.

564
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,018
You like it?

565
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,979
It's my first.

566
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:34,193
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.

567
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,699
Okay.

568
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,378
Talk to me some more.

569
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,966
About what?

570
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,428
Tell me about where you're from.

571
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,307
All right.

572
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,186
You stay down by day.

573
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,563
But at night you can move around.

574
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:14,525
You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.

575
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,946
But they're not too bright.

576
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:22,450
John taught us ways to dust them.

577
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:25,661
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

578
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,748
The Terminators were
the newest, the worst.

579
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,761
It's traversing your sector
in search mode.

580
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:44,555
75· meters north of your position.

581
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,186
Let's go.

582
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,442
Reese. DN-384-

583
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,902
Right. Let him in.

584
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:52,206
Our spotter's got a bad paw,
so we're cutting short the patrol.

585
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:56,544
Roger, Yankee 17.
You are cleared to return.

586
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:12,745
Terminator! Terminator!

587
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,783
I was dreaming about dogs.

588
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,078
We use them to spot Terminators.

589
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,999
Your world is pretty terrifying.

590
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:22,583
Hey, buddy. You got a dead cat
in there, or what?

591
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,884
Fuck you, asshole.

592
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:52,697
Goddamn!

593
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:55,241
Thank you!

594
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,248
Is this enough?

595
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:06,377
Yeah, that's enough. I don't
want to ask where you got it.

596
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,759
- Coming.
- We need a room.

597
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,928
- All right.
- With a kitchen.

598
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,513
Have one with a kitchen?

599
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:36,198
I am dying for a shower.

600
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:40,369
We should check your bandage too.

601
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,706
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

602
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:49,462
Keep this.

603
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,239
I can't tell you where I am, Mom.

604
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:18,657
I was told not to say.

605
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,035
I need to know
where I can reach you.

606
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,996
You tell me to hide at the cabin
like a fugitive...

607
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:26,540
...and you won't tell me
what's going on?

608
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:29,168
I am worried sick, dear.

609
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:30,920
Okay.

610
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:33,339
Here's the number.

611
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,341
- You ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

612
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:39,053
It's 4··-666-...

613
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,347
...1439.

614
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:43,432
Room nine. Got it?

615
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:45,518
- I've got it.
- I've gotta go.

616
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,604
I'm sorry I can't
tell you more right now.

617
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,773
I love you, Mom.

618
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:56,445
I love you too, sweetheart.

619
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:11,377
- Tiki Motel.
- Give me your address there.

620
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,715
What have we got?

621
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,012
Mothballs...

622
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:24,181
...corn syrup...

623
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:25,850
...ammonia.

624
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,893
What's for dinner?

625
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:31,564
- Plastique.
- That sounds good.

626
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:33,232
What is it?

627
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:36,026
A nitroglycerin base.

628
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:39,905
It's a bit more stable. I learned
to make it when I was a kid.

629
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:54,003
Make sure there's none
on the threads.

630
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:57,464
Like this.

631
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:01,093
Screw the end-cap on.

632
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:04,763
Very gently.

633
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,768
You must have had a fun childhood.

634
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,773
That's good.

635
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:19,111
Six more like that,
and I'll get started on the fuses.

636
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,458
He'll find us, won't he?

637
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:36,587
Probably.

638
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:56,774
It'll never be over, will it?

639
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,201
Look at me, I'm shaking.

640
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:10,579
Some legend, huh?

641
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:13,666
You must be pretty disappointed.

642
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,168
No...

643
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:18,754
...I'm not.

644
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:28,764
Kyle...

645
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,226
...the women in your time...

646
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:34,353
...what are they like?

647
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,482
Good fighters.

648
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:41,193
That's not what I meant.

649
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,531
Was there someone special?

650
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:48,742
Someone?

651
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:51,620
A girl. You know.

652
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:54,373
No.

653
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:58,627
Never.

654
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:02,047
Never?

655
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:07,970
I'm sorry.

656
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:10,723
I'm so sorry.

657
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:15,561
So much pain.

658
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:18,897
Pain can be controlled.

659
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:21,150
You just disconnect it.

660
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:23,736
So you feel nothing?

661
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:31,577
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

662
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,247
I didn't know why at the time.

663
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,584
It was very old...

664
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,003
...torn...

665
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:42,921
...faded.

666
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,260
You were young, like you are now.

667
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,013
You seemed just...

668
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:52,806
...a little sad.

669
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:56,685
I always wondered what
you were thinking at that moment.

670
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:00,647
I memorized every line...

671
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,984
...every curve.

672
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:09,364
I came across time for you, Sarah.

673
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,910
I love you.

674
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:15,537
I always have.

675
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,474
I shouldn't have said that.

676
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,483
Think fast!

677
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:38,699
Trade places!

678
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:51,503
Faster!

679
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,380
Drive faster!

680
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:44,348
Kyle!

681
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:46,224
Oh, my God!

682
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:37,859
- Whoa!
- Son of a bitch!

683
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,460
You stay here.

684
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:20,318
Let's get out of-

685
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:25,323
Get out.

686
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:45,218
Kyle, come on. Get up.

687
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,435
Help me.

688
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,396
Come on!

689
01:27:57,564 --> 01:27:58,815
Help me!

690
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:00,358
Get out! Get out!

691
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:03,236
Get out!

692
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:20,795
Faster!

693
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:27,052
Don't stop! Run!

694
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:40,810
Sarah?

695
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:42,437
Kyle!

696
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:54,658
We did it, Kyle!

697
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:56,076
We got it!

698
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:17,055
No!

699
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,890
No!

700
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:15,780
Wait.

701
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:22,287
What are you doing?

702
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:25,457
Cover. So it can't track us.

703
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:37,343
Come on!

704
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:38,970
Come on.

705
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:41,056
No! Kyle!

706
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:42,932
Come on!

707
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:45,393
- Come on!
- Leave me here.

708
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:58,406
Move it, Reese!

709
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:01,201
On your feet, soldier!

710
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:03,411
On your feet!

711
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:04,829
Move it!

712
01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:18,820
Back! Go back!

713
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:55,106
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

714
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:56,774
Run!

715
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:01,946
Run!

716
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:03,948
Come on, motherfucker!

717
01:36:57,603 --> 01:36:59,147
No, no...

718
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:59,225
You're terminated, fucker.

719
01:39:57,366 --> 01:39:59,035
Oh, Kyle...

720
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:22,016
Tape seven. November 10.

721
01:40:22,225 --> 01:40:23,809
Where was I?

722
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:28,522
What's most difficult is deciding
what to tell you and what not to.

723
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:33,361
But I guess I have a while before
you're old enough to understand.

724
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:37,156
They're more for me at this point,
just so I can get it straight.

725
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:15,987
Ah, fill her up.

726
01:41:20,616 --> 01:41:22,493
Should I tell you about your father?

727
01:41:22,827 --> 01:41:24,912
Boy, that's a tough one.

728
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:31,085
Will it affect your decision to send
him here, knowing he is your father?

729
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:35,923
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

730
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:39,385
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

731
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,682
I suppose I will tell you.

732
01:41:46,559 --> 01:41:48,644
I owe him that.

733
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:52,940
Maybe it'll help...

734
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:55,318
...if you know...

735
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:58,654
...that in the few hours
we had together...

736
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:02,992
...we loved a lifetime's worth.

737
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:16,964
What did he say?

738
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:19,550
He says, "You're very beautiful,
se·ora. "

739
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:23,179
And he's ashamed to ask you
for five dollars for this picture.

740
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:26,057
But if he doesn't,
his father will beat him.

741
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:28,309
Pretty good hustle, kid.

742
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:46,911
What did he just say?

743
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:49,747
He said there's a storm coming in.

744
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:55,753
I know.

745
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:11,000
<i>Subs Sync Checked ..by iUrop</i>ρή‎.

464
01:17:38,306 --> 01:17:41,142
Έμαθα να το φτιάχνω όταν ήμουν παιδί‎.

465
01:17:52,195 --> 01:17:54,864
Σιγουρέψου ότι δεν έχει
μείνει πάνω στα νήματα‎.

466
01:17:56,407 --> 01:17:58,409
Έτσι‎.

467
01:17:59,911 --> 01:18:02,121
Βίδωσε το πώμα‎.

468
01:18:03,665 --> 01:18:05,875
Πολύ απαλά‎.

469
01:18:07,961 --> 01:18:10,380
Πέρασες καλά φαίνεται
όταν ήσουν παιδί‎.

470
01:18:14,008 --> 01:18:15,802
Καλό είναι‎.

471
01:18:15,927 --> 01:18:20,890
Έξι ακόμη και θ' αρχίσω
με τους πυροσωλήνες‎.

472
01:18:31,067 --> 01:18:33,486
Θα μας βρει‎, έτσι δεν είναι;

473
01:18:35,738 --> 01:18:37,782
Πιθανόν‎.

474
01:18:55,216 --> 01:18:57,886
Δεν θα τελειώσει ποτέ‎, έτσι;

475
01:19:05,852 --> 01:19:08,062
Κοίτα με‎. Τρέμω‎.

476
01:19:09,105 --> 01:19:14,277
Τι θρύλος που είμαι‎. Πρέπει
να έχεις απογοητευτεί‎.

477
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:19,032
Όχι‎.

478
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:32,170
Κάιλ‎, οι γυναίκες της εποχής σου‎,

479
01:19:33,379 --> 01:19:35,590
πώς είναι;

480
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:39,552
Καλοί μαχητές‎.

481
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:42,388
Δεν εννοούσα αυτό‎.

482
01:19:43,973 --> 01:19:46,392
Υπήρχε κάποια ξεχωριστή;

483
01:19:47,894 --> 01:19:49,687
Κάποια‎.‎.‎.;

484
01:19:49,813 --> 01:19:52,065
Ένα κορίτσι‎.

485
01:19:53,608 --> 01:19:55,610
Όχι‎.

486
01:19:57,987 --> 01:19:59,989
Ποτέ‎.

487
01:20:01,115 --> 01:20:03,117
Ποτέ;

488
01:20:07,705 --> 01:20:10,959
Συγνώμη‎.

489
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:16,172
Τόσος πολύς πόνος‎.

490
01:20:17,382 --> 01:20:21,803
Ο πόνος μπορεί να ελεγχθεί‎.
Με το να τον αποσυνδέσεις‎.

491
01:20:22,428 --> 01:20:25,265
Δεν αισθάνεσαι τίποτα;

492
01:20:29,435 --> 01:20:32,522
Ο Τζον Κόνορ μου είχε δώσει
κάποτε μια φωτογραφία σου‎.

493
01:20:34,232 --> 01:20:37,277
Δεν ήξερα γιατί τότε‎.

494
01:20:37,443 --> 01:20:43,408
Ήταν πολύ παλιά‎,
σχισμένη‎, ξεθωριασμένη‎.

495
01:20:47,078 --> 01:20:53,585
Ήσουν νέα όπως τώρα‎,
λίγο λυπημένη‎.

496
01:20:54,711 --> 01:20:58,840
Αναρωτιόμουν τι σκεφτόσουν
εκείνη τη στιγμή‎.

497
01:20:59,007 --> 01:21:02,469
Κράτησα στο μυαλό μου
κάθε γραμμή του προσώπου σου‎,

498
01:21:02,635 --> 01:21:04,637
κάθε γωνία‎.

499
01:21:08,016 --> 01:21:11,853
Γύρισα πίσω στο χρόνο για σένα‎.

500
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:16,191
Σ' αγαπώ‎. Πάντα σ' αγαπούσα‎.

501
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:36,544
Δεν έπρεπε να το πω αυτό‎.

502
01:23:06,843 --> 01:23:09,554
Σκέψου γρήγορα‎.

503
01:24:38,101 --> 01:24:40,103
Ν' αλλάξουμε θέσεις‎.

504
01:24:50,488 --> 01:24:54,075
Πιο γρήγορα‎. Οδήγα πιο γρήγορα‎.

505
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:46,878
Κάιλ‎. Θεέ μου‎.

506
01:26:54,529 --> 01:26:56,948
Μείνε εδώ‎.

507
01:27:19,804 --> 01:27:21,806
Πάμε να φύγουμε‎.

508
01:27:24,642 --> 01:27:26,853
Βγες έξω‎.

509
01:27:43,036 --> 01:27:45,914
Κάιλ‎. Σήκω‎.

510
01:27:55,715 --> 01:27:57,091
Έλα‎.

511
01:27:58,218 --> 01:28:01,054
Βοήθησέ με‎. Βγες έξω‎.

512
01:28:25,245 --> 01:28:27,705
Μη σταματάς‎. Τρέχα‎.

513
01:30:39,963 --> 01:30:42,173
Σάρα‎.

514
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:44,134
Κάιλ‎.

515
01:30:53,601 --> 01:30:56,646
Τα καταφέραμε‎. Τον σκοτώσαμε‎.

516
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:17,458
Όχι‎.

517
01:32:15,225 --> 01:32:16,684
Περίμενε‎.

518
01:32:21,272 --> 01:32:23,650
Τι κάνεις;

519
01:32:23,817 --> 01:32:26,110
Κάλυψη για να μη μας αναχαιτίσει‎.

520
01:32:27,987 --> 01:32:29,280
ΑΥΤΟΜΑΤΟΠΟΙΗΜΕΝΗ
ΑΛΛΗΛΟΥΧΙΑ ΠΑΡΑΓΩΓΗΣ

521
01:32:36,663 --> 01:32:39,082
Έλα‎.

522
01:32:40,041 --> 01:32:43,586
Όχι Κάιλ‎. Πάμε‎.

523
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:47,549
‎- Πάμε‎.
‎- ’σε με εδώ‎.

524
01:32:57,308 --> 01:33:01,896
Κουνήσου Ρης‎. Σήκω πάνω‎,
στρατιώτη‎.

525
01:33:02,063 --> 01:33:05,483
Σήκω‎. Κουνήσου‎.

526
01:34:17,597 --> 01:34:19,599
Κάνε πίσω‎.

527
01:34:54,008 --> 01:34:55,844
‎- Τρέξε‎, Σάρα‎.
‎- Όχι‎.

528
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:57,720
Τρέξε‎.

529
01:35:01,015 --> 01:35:02,809
Τρέξε

530
01:35:02,976 --> 01:35:05,562
Έλα‎, κάθαρμα‎.

531
01:36:58,049 --> 01:36:59,843
Όχι‎.

532
01:38:58,545 --> 01:39:00,755
Θα σ' εξολοθρεύσω‎, κάθαρμα‎.

533
01:39:58,188 --> 01:40:00,190
Κάιλ‎.

534
01:40:20,752 --> 01:40:24,214
Επτά‎. 10 Νοεμβρίου‎. Που ήμουν;

535
01:40:25,465 --> 01:40:29,219
Το πιο δύσκολο είναι τι
πρέπει να σου πω και τι όχι‎.

536
01:40:29,761 --> 01:40:34,057
Έχω καιρό μέχρι να μεγαλώσεις και
να καταλάβεις αυτές τις ηχογραφήσεις‎.

537
01:40:34,224 --> 01:40:39,145
Προς το παρόν‎, είναι περισσότερο για
μένα για να ξεκαθαρίσω τα πράγματα‎.

538
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:17,142
Γέμισέ μου το‎.

539
01:41:20,603 --> 01:41:23,189
Πρέπει να σου πω για τον πατέρα σου;

540
01:41:23,356 --> 01:41:25,567
Με προβληματίζει αυτό πολύ‎.

541
01:41:27,110 --> 01:41:32,740
Θα επηρεάσει την απόφασή σου να τον
στείλεις εδώ‎, ξέροντας ποιος είναι;

542
01:41:33,741 --> 01:41:36,578
Αν δεν στείλεις τον Κάιλ‎,
δεν θα υπάρξεις ποτέ‎.

543
01:41:36,744 --> 01:41:39,789
Θα μπορούσε κανείς να τρελαθεί
μελετώντας όλ αυτά‎.

544
01:41:43,543 --> 01:41:46,921
Μάλλον θα σου πω‎.

545
01:41:47,088 --> 01:41:49,299
Του το χρωστάω‎.

546
01:41:51,509 --> 01:41:53,928
Ίσως σε βοηθήσει αν‎.‎.‎.

547
01:41:54,095 --> 01:41:59,225
ξέρεις ότι οι λίγες ώρες
που περάσαμε μαζί‎,

548
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:03,730
αγαπηθήκαμε για
σε μια ολόκληρη ζωή‎.

549
01:42:16,367 --> 01:42:20,079
‎- Τι είπε;
‎- Λέει ότι είσαι πολύ όμορφη‎.

550
01:42:20,246 --> 01:42:23,291
Ντρέπεται να σου ζητήσει πέντε
δολάρια για τη φωτογραφία‎.

551
01:42:23,458 --> 01:42:26,753
Αλλά αν δεν το κάνει‎, ο πατέρας του
θα τον σπάσει στο ξύλο‎.

552
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,881
Ωραίος εκβιασμός ο πιτσιρικάς‎.

553
01:42:46,064 --> 01:42:48,233
Τι είπε;

554
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:51,444
Είπε ότι έρχεται καταιγίδα‎.

555
01:42:54,989 --> 01:42:56,991
Το ξέρω‎.
