1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:41,708
23.976 DVDrip

2
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:18,120
<i>-You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!</i>

3
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,338
<i>I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.</i>

4
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,016
<i>Go back to the Shadow.</i>

5
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,729
<i>The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udún!</i>

6
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:52,112
You shall not pass!

7
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,933
No! No!

8
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,143
Gandalf!

9
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,444
Fly, you fools.

10
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,988
No!

11
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,992
Gandalf!

12
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,479
Gandalf!

13
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,733
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

14
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,403
Nothing.

15
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,746
Just a dream.

16
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,135
Can you see the bottom?

17
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,556
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

18
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,486
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,574
Mr. Frodo!

20
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,954
I think I've found the bottom.

21
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,337
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

22
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,757
It's not natural. None of it.

23
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,887
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

24
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,348
Just a bit of seasoning.

25
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,726
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

26
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,521
Roast chicken?!

27
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,398
You never know.

28
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,776
Sam. My dear Sam.

29
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,407
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

30
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,702
It is special.

31
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,457
It's a little bit of home.

32
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,213
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

33
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:42,176
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

34
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,847
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

35
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,516
Real Elvish rope.

36
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,769
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

37
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,938
Won't come free in a hurry.

38
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,949
Real Elvish rope.

39
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:24,593
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

40
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,929
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

41
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,473
It's just where we can't get.

42
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,852
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

43
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,982
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

44
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,904
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

45
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,240
...but they did.

46
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,295
Mr. Frodo?

47
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,634
It's the Ring, isn't it?

48
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,221
It's getting heavier.

49
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,570
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

50
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,364
Oh, yes. Lovely.

51
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:30,325
Lembas bread. And look!

52
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,038
More lembas bread.

53
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,759
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

54
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,929
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

55
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,267
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

56
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,358
Those rain clouds might.

57
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,479
This looks strangely familiar.

58
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,524
It's because we've been here before.

59
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,318
We're going in circles.

60
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,904
What is that horrid stink?

61
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,240
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

62
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,367
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

63
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,663
I can smell it.

64
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,335
We're not alone.

65
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:21,061
The thieves. The thieves.

66
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,190
The filthy little thieves.

67
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,026
Where is it?

68
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,904
Where is it?

69
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,825
They stole it from us.

70
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:39,204
My precious.

71
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,333
Curse them, we hates them!

72
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:47,629
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

73
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,520
This is Sting.

74
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,230
You've seen it before...

75
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,899
... haven't you, Gollum?

76
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,448
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

77
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,258
It burns!

78
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,718
It burns us!

79
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,680
It freezes!

80
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,725
Nasty Elves twisted it.

81
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,562
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

82
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:34,278
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

83
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,030
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

84
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,826
That would kill us! Kill us!

85
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,662
It's no more than you deserve!

86
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,416
Maybe he does deserve to die.

87
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,255
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

88
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:01,597
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

89
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,600
Take it off us.

90
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,607
We swears to do what you wants.

91
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,692
We swears.

92
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,445
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

93
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,866
We swears...

94
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:25,913
...to serve the master
of the precious.

95
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,875
We will swear on...

96
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,960
...on the precious.

97
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,338
Gollum. Gollum.

98
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:38,675
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

99
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,802
Yes...

100
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,889
...on the precious.

101
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,685
On the precious.

102
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,396
I don't believe you!

103
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:56,860
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

104
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,820
He's trying to trick us.

105
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,990
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

106
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:17,923
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

107
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,636
You've been there before?

108
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,222
Yes.

109
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,735
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

110
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,206
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

111
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:56,170
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

112
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:00,591
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

113
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,219
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

114
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:10,392
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

115
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,437
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

116
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:18,734
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

117
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,490
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

118
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,120
There! What did I tell you?

119
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,539
He's run off, the old villain.

120
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,250
So much for his promises.

121
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,002
This way, Hobbits.

122
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,296
Follow me!

123
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,561
Merry!

124
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,022
Merry!

125
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:06,281
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

126
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,283
He wants the Shire-rats now.

127
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,789
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

128
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:17,918
Saruman will have his prize.

129
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:21,255
We will deliver them.

130
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,804
Merry!

131
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,348
Merry? Wake up.

132
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,645
My friend is sick.

133
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,773
He needs water. Please!

134
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:44,486
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

135
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,366
Stop it!

136
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:54,204
Can't take his draught!

137
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,459
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

138
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,379
You want some?

139
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:06,466
Then keep your mouth shut.

140
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,889
Merry.

141
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,308
Hello, Pip.

142
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,562
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

143
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,273
- It was just an act.
- An act?

144
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,776
See? I fooled you too.

145
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,239
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

146
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,535
What is it? What do you smell?

147
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:35,829
Man-flesh.

148
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,292
They've picked up our trail.

149
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,544
Aragorn.

150
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,048
Let's move!

151
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,199
Their pace has quickened.

152
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,118
They must have caught our scent.

153
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,079
Hurry!

154
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,501
Come on, Gimli!

155
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,632
Three days and nights pursuit.

156
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,760
No food. No rest.

157
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:35,931
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

158
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:10,549
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

159
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:14,219
They may yet be alive.

160
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,681
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

161
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,811
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

162
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:27,316
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

163
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,111
Very dangerous over short distances.

164
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,583
Rohan.

165
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,544
Home of the Horse-Iords.

166
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,298
There's something strange at work here.

167
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:54,468
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

168
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:57,596
Sets its will against us.

169
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,646
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

170
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,398
The Uruks turn northeast.

171
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,360
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

172
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,529
Saruman.

173
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:25,123
<i>The world is changing.</i>

174
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,879
<i>Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...</i>

175
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,341
<i>... and Mordor?</i>

176
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:41,682
<i>To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...</i>

177
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,519
<i>... and the union of the two towers?</i>

178
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,987
<i>Together, my Lord Sauron...</i>

179
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,657
<i>... we shall rule this Middle-earth.</i>

180
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,011
<i>The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.</i>

181
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,848
<i>The forests will fall.</i>

182
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,603
<i>A new order will rise.</i>

183
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:33,609
<i>We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...</i>

184
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:37,738
<i>... and the iron fists of the Orc.</i>

185
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,504
I want them armed and ready to march
within two weeks!

186
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,297
But, my lord, there are too many!

187
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:58,509
They cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

188
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,720
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

189
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,723
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

190
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:10,395
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

191
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,149
- Burn it.
- Yes.

192
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,194
We will fight for you.

193
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,321
Swear it.

194
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:34,628
We will die for Saruman.

195
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,714
The Horse-Men took your lands.

196
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,427
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

197
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,012
Murderers!

198
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,057
Take back the lands they stole from you.

199
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,017
Burn every village!

200
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:57,359
<i>We have only to remove those
who oppose us.</i>

201
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,362
<i>It will begin in Rohan.</i>

202
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,658
<i>Too long have these peasants
stood against you.</i>

203
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,618
<i>But no more.</i>

204
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,079
Éothain! Éothain!

205
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,917
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

206
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,920
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

207
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,797
He is too big for him.

208
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:21,925
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

209
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,678
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

210
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,848
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

211
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:31,727
Freda, I will find you there.

212
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,358
Quickly!

213
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,325
Go, child.

214
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,131
<i>Rohan, my lord...</i>

215
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,343
<i>... is ready to fall.</i>

216
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,105
Théodred.

217
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:18,941
Find the king's son!

218
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:41,421
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

219
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,175
My Lord Éomer, over here!

220
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:55,769
He's alive.

221
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:28,677
Théodred.

222
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:45,110
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

223
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,988
He was ambushed by Orcs.

224
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:53,160
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

225
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:56,038
That is a lie.

226
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:03,045
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

227
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,715
Gríma.

228
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,093
Gríma.

229
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:14,097
Gríma.

230
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,976
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

231
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:21,980
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

232
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:25,567
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

233
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:39,164
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

234
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,875
Can you not see?

235
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,047
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

236
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:49,800
...your warmongering.

237
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:53,971
Warmongering?

238
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:56,306
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

239
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,518
What was the promised price, Gríma?

240
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:03,355
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

241
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:18,453
Too long have you watched my sister.

242
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:20,622
Too long have you haunted her steps.

243
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:33,010
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

244
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:34,386
Too much.

245
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,518
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

246
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:46,481
...and all its domains
under pain of death.

247
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,318
You have no authority here.

248
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:51,945
Your orders mean nothing.

249
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:56,283
This order does not come from me.

250
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,619
It comes from the king.

251
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:01,830
He signed it this morning.

252
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:36,114
Keep breathing. That's the key.

253
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:38,033
Breathe.

254
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,999
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

255
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,142
We're not going no further...

256
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,311
... until we've had a breather.

257
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,814
Get a fire going!

258
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,444
Merry!

259
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,196
Merry!

260
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:23,078
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

261
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,756
What's making that noise?

262
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:37,759
It's the trees.

263
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:39,595
What?

264
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:43,765
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

265
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:48,437
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

266
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:50,147
...and come alive.

267
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,065
Alive?

268
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,610
Trees that could whisper...

269
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,113
...talk to each other...

270
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,073
...even move.

271
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:03,952
I'm starving.

272
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:08,165
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

273
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,833
Yeah!

274
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,295
Why can't we have some meat?!

275
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:17,841
What about them?

276
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:19,927
They're fresh.

277
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:24,389
They are not for eating.

278
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:32,314
What about their legs?

279
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,816
They don't need those.

280
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:39,488
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

281
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:46,161
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

282
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,497
Alive?

283
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:55,754
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

284
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,510
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

285
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:04,680
The master wants it for the war.

286
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,518
They think we have the Ring.

287
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:12,104
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

288
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:15,941
Just a mouthful...

289
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:17,317
...a bit of the flank.

290
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:27,661
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

291
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:35,544
Pippin.

292
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:37,421
Let's go.

293
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:47,347
Go on.

294
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:49,016
Call for help.

295
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:51,518
Squeal.

296
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:54,897
No one's going to save you now.

297
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,449
Pippin!

298
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:32,267
A red sun rises.

299
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:35,687
Blood has been spilled this night.

300
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:08,720
Riders of Rohan...

301
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,640
...what news from the Mark?

302
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:43,797
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

303
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,799
Speak quickly!

304
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:50,846
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

305
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,482
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

306
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:05,319
...if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

307
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,405
You would die before your stroke fell.

308
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,041
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

309
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:23,587
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

310
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:26,965
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

311
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:32,513
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

312
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,890
Not even his own kin.

313
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:41,396
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

314
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,482
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

315
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:48,445
My company are those Ioyal to Rohan.

316
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:50,405
And for that, we are banished.

317
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:55,786
The White Wizard is cunning.

318
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,872
He walks here and there, they say...

319
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,999
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

320
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,713
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

321
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,091
We are no spies.

322
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:12,177
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

323
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:14,805
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

324
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,100
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

325
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:21,436
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

326
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:24,565
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

327
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,903
We left none alive.

328
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:33,490
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

329
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:40,205
Dead?

330
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,960
I am sorry.

331
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,759
Hasufel! Arod!

332
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:59,266
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

333
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,060
Farewell.

334
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:09,484
Look for your friends.

335
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:12,237
But do not trust to hope.

336
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:16,492
It has forsaken these lands.

337
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,702
We ride north!

338
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:11,088
It's one of their wee belts.

339
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:26,937
We failed them.

340
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:43,162
A Hobbit lay here.

341
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,707
And the other.

342
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,094
They crawled.

343
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:05,350
Their hands were bound.

344
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:19,281
Their bonds were cut.

345
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:36,924
They ran over here.

346
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:41,762
They were followed.

347
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:46,683
The belt!

348
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:51,730
Run!

349
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:56,819
Tracks lead away from the battle...

350
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:03,700
...into Fangorn Forest.

351
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:06,078
Fangorn?

352
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:08,872
What madness drove them in there?

353
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,601
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

354
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:39,778
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

355
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:46,994
Come here!

356
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:55,043
Trees. Climb a tree.

357
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:06,096
He's gone.

358
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,527
Merry!

359
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,418
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

360
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,093
Run, Merry!

361
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:59,233
Little Orcs.

362
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:01,693
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

363
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,779
Tree?

364
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:06,949
I am no tree!

365
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,326
I am an Ent.

366
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,079
A tree-herder.

367
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,581
A shepherd of the forest.

368
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,124
Don't talk to it, Merry.

369
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,085
Don't encourage it!

370
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:22,548
Treebeard, some call me.

371
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,675
And whose side are you on?

372
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:26,885
Side?

373
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:29,972
I am on nobody's side...

374
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:35,644
...because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

375
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:41,108
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

376
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:43,902
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

377
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:46,363
Hobbits?

378
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:52,494
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

379
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:58,167
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

380
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,502
They come with fire.

381
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:03,255
They come with axes.

382
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:08,260
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

383
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:12,264
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

384
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:15,350
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

385
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,352
Halflings!

386
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:18,604
Shire-folk!

387
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:21,148
Maybe you are...

388
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,110
...and maybe you aren't.

389
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:30,115
The White Wizard will know.

390
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:32,826
The White Wizard?

391
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:35,871
Saruman.

392
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:50,093
See? See?

393
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:52,721
We've led you out.

394
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:55,432
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

395
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,979
Very lucky we find you.

396
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:09,404
Nice Hobbit.

397
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:15,577
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

398
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:18,372
A swamp, yes, yes.

399
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:23,877
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

400
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:29,633
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

401
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:35,556
I found it. I did.

402
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:38,392
The way through the marshes.

403
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,104
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

404
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:46,400
They go around for miles and miles.

405
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,026
Come quickly.

406
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:52,239
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

407
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:56,785
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

408
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:59,204
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

409
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:02,749
No, no birdses to eat.

410
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,212
No crunchable birdses.

411
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:10,716
We are famished! Yes!

412
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:15,179
Famished we are, precious!

413
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,653
Here.

414
00:43:32,863 --> 00:43:34,865
What does it eats?

415
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:37,034
Is it tasty?

416
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:44,958
It tries to chokes us!

417
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:48,879
We can't eats Hobbit food!

418
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:54,635
We must starve!

419
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,137
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

420
00:43:57,888 --> 00:44:00,098
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

421
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:03,143
It does not care if we be hungry.

422
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:08,148
Does not care if we should die.

423
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:11,568
Not like master.

424
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:15,072
Master cares.

425
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,116
Master knows.

426
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:22,538
Yes.

427
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:25,332
Precious.

428
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:32,548
Once it takes hold of us...

429
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:38,595
...it never lets go.

430
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:40,472
Don't touch me!

431
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:14,798
There are dead things!

432
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,758
Dead faces in the water.

433
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:25,559
All dead. All rotten.

434
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:29,813
Elves and Men and Orcses.

435
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:33,609
A great battle long ago.

436
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:36,195
Dead Marshes.

437
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:39,114
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

438
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:42,534
This way.

439
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:45,496
Don't follow the lights.

440
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:51,126
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

441
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:55,422
...and light little candles
of their own.

442
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:23,116
Frodo!

443
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:12,207
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

444
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,251
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

445
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:16,295
Are you all right?

446
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:48,160
So bright.

447
00:47:48,368 --> 00:47:52,164
So beautiful.

448
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:56,210
Our precious.

449
00:47:57,711 --> 00:47:59,171
What did you say?

450
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:01,548
Master should be resting.

451
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:05,761
Master needs to keep up his strength.

452
00:48:07,763 --> 00:48:11,016
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

453
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,684
Gollum. Gollum.

454
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:14,645
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

455
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:18,941
<i>Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home</i>

456
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:20,651
He said your life was a sad story.

457
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:25,405
<i>They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead</i>

458
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:28,575
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

459
00:48:28,784 --> 00:48:30,494
Were you?

460
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:34,998
Sméagol.

461
00:48:39,711 --> 00:48:42,214
What did you call me?

462
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,343
That was your name once, wasn't it?

463
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:49,263
A long time ago.

464
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:52,266
My name.

465
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:54,810
My name.

466
00:49:01,692 --> 00:49:04,194
Sméagol.

467
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:09,950
Black Riders!

468
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:11,451
Hide! Hide!

469
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:24,339
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

470
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:28,135
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

471
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:31,597
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

472
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:34,683
No, you cannot kill them. No.

473
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:02,961
Wraiths!

474
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,380
Wraiths on wings!

475
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:15,432
They are calling for it.

476
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:19,186
They are calling for the precious.

477
00:50:21,355 --> 00:50:23,440
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

478
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:24,900
I'm here.

479
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:42,459
Hurry, Hobbits.

480
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:46,922
The Black Gate is very close.

481
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:55,681
Orc blood.

482
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:07,401
These are strange tracks.

483
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:10,696
The air is so close in here.

484
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:14,283
This forest is old.

485
00:51:15,117 --> 00:51:17,077
Very old.

486
00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:21,123
Full of memory...

487
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,086
...and anger.

488
00:51:32,259 --> 00:51:35,179
The trees are speaking to each other.

489
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:36,805
Gimli!

490
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:38,932
Lower your ax.

491
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:44,480
They have feelings, my friend.

492
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:47,024
The Elves began it.

493
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:51,987
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

494
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:54,865
Talking trees.

495
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:58,494
What do trees have to talk about?

496
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:01,872
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

497
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:18,263
The White Wizard approaches.

498
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:28,732
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

499
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:40,577
We must be quick.

500
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:59,805
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

501
00:53:00,389 --> 00:53:01,765
Where are they?

502
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:05,519
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

503
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:09,982
They met someone they did not expect.

504
00:53:10,149 --> 00:53:12,276
Does that comfort you?

505
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:14,403
Who are you?

506
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:17,823
Show yourself!

507
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:28,750
It cannot be.

508
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:32,713
Forgive me.

509
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:36,300
I mistook you for Saruman.

510
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,803
I am Saruman.

511
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:45,225
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

512
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:47,686
You fell.

513
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:51,690
Through fire...

514
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:53,192
...and water.

515
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:57,196
<i>From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...</i>

516
00:53:57,321 --> 00:54:01,074
<i>... I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.</i>

517
00:54:16,882 --> 00:54:19,635
<i>U ntil at last I threw down
my enemy...</i>

518
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:24,264
<i>... and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.</i>

519
00:54:30,312 --> 00:54:32,856
<i>Darkness took me...</i>

520
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:37,653
<i>... and I strayed out of thought
and time.</i>

521
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:41,490
<i>Stars wheeled overhead...</i>

522
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:46,286
<i>... and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.</i>

523
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:50,541
<i>But it was not the end.</i>

524
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:53,627
<i>I felt life in me again.</i>

525
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:58,090
<i>I've been sent back...</i>

526
00:54:58,257 --> 00:54:59,800
... until my task is done.

527
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:02,094
Gandalf.

528
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:04,763
Gandalf?

529
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,974
Yes.

530
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:11,562
That was what they used to call me.

531
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:16,733
Gandalf the Grey.

532
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:19,820
That was my name.

533
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:21,405
Gandalf.

534
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,450
I am Gandalf the White.

535
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:31,582
And I come back to you now...

536
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:34,209
...at the turn of the tide.

537
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:38,297
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

538
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:42,259
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

539
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:45,220
That is no short distance!

540
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:48,682
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

541
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:50,976
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

542
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:54,563
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

543
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:56,732
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

544
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:01,111
...in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?

545
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:06,867
I mean, charming...

546
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:09,786
...quite charming forest.

547
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:13,999
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

548
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:18,545
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

549
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:22,132
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

550
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:25,677
...that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

551
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:28,805
I n one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

552
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:32,559
You still speak in riddles.

553
00:56:35,437 --> 00:56:41,860
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

554
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:45,656
The Ents are going to wake up...

555
00:56:46,198 --> 00:56:50,661
...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

556
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:52,621
Oh, that's good.

557
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:55,499
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

558
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,877
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

559
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:02,631
I n fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

560
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:06,552
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

561
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:30,242
That is one of the Mearas...

562
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:33,203
... unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

563
00:57:50,846 --> 00:57:53,098
Shadowfax.

564
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:58,312
He is the lord of all horses...

565
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:03,817
...and has been my friend
through many dangers.

566
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,668
<i>O rowan mine</i>

567
00:58:21,877 --> 00:58:25,672
<i>I saw you shine</i>

568
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,343
<i>U pon a summer's day</i>

569
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:34,890
<i>U pon your head
How golden-red</i>

570
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:39,853
<i>The crown you bore aloft</i>

571
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,439
Such a beautiful verse.

572
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:47,486
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

573
00:58:47,653 --> 00:58:50,948
You might call it far, perhaps.

574
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:55,661
My home lies deep in the forest...

575
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:59,748
... near the roots of the mountain.

576
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:04,711
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

577
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,841
And safe is where I'll keep you.

578
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:13,554
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

579
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:16,932
It's one of my own compositions.

580
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:18,308
Right.

581
00:59:18,475 --> 00:59:24,606
<i>Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves</i>

582
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:29,653
<i>And the dreams of trees unfold</i>

583
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:36,243
<i>When woodland halls are green and cool</i>

584
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:40,539
<i>And the wind is in the West</i>

585
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:43,709
<i>Come back to me</i>

586
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:48,714
<i>Come back to me</i>

587
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:55,304
<i>And say my land is best</i>

588
01:00:02,728 --> 01:00:06,440
Sleep, little Shirelings.

589
01:00:06,565 --> 01:00:10,194
Heed no nightly noise.

590
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,281
Sleep till morning light.

591
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:20,078
I have business in the forest.

592
01:00:20,245 --> 01:00:25,792
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

593
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:31,715
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

594
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:37,679
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

595
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:51,401
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

596
01:00:52,236 --> 01:00:54,822
Sauron will suffer no rival.

597
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:59,535
From the summit of Barad-dúr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

598
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:03,080
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

599
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:06,041
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

600
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,836
The rumor has reached him.

601
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:11,922
The heir of Númenor still lives.

602
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:15,759
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

603
01:01:17,094 --> 01:01:19,263
He fears what you may become.

604
01:01:20,556 --> 01:01:23,934
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

605
01:01:24,143 --> 01:01:27,729
He will use his puppet Saruman
to destroy Rohan.

606
01:01:27,938 --> 01:01:29,439
War is coming.

607
01:01:29,565 --> 01:01:33,193
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

608
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:35,779
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

609
01:01:35,946 --> 01:01:39,616
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

610
01:01:39,825 --> 01:01:42,911
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

611
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:47,791
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

612
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,752
But for all their cunning...

613
01:01:50,919 --> 01:01:53,463
...we have one advantage.

614
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:58,218
The Ring remains hidden.

615
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:01,180
And that we should seek to destroy it...

616
01:02:01,346 --> 01:02:04,308
... has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

617
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:08,228
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

618
01:02:08,395 --> 01:02:09,855
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

619
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:14,151
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

620
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:16,945
We must trust now in Frodo.

621
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:18,947
Everything depends upon speed...

622
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:22,117
...and the secrecy of his quest.

623
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,414
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

624
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:31,043
Frodo must finish this task alone.

625
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:34,129
He's not alone.

626
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:35,964
Sam went with him.

627
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:37,841
Did he?

628
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:42,679
Did he, indeed? Good.

629
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:45,682
Yes, very good.

630
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:58,612
The Black Gate of Mordor.

631
01:03:01,323 --> 01:03:03,826
Oh, save us.

632
01:03:09,623 --> 01:03:12,876
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

633
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:19,591
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

634
01:03:19,758 --> 01:03:23,178
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

635
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:24,596
I did.

636
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:35,357
That's it, then.

637
01:03:36,942 --> 01:03:38,235
We can't get past that.

638
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:24,740
Look!

639
01:04:24,907 --> 01:04:26,366
The gate.

640
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:27,743
It's opening!

641
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:37,127
I can see a way down.

642
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,963
Sam, no!

643
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:43,550
Master!

644
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:10,846
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

645
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:14,808
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

646
01:06:15,267 --> 01:06:17,102
- Now!
- No!

647
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:19,646
No! No, master!

648
01:06:19,855 --> 01:06:22,816
They catch you! They catch you!

649
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:26,695
Don't take it to him.

650
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:32,367
He wants the precious.

651
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:35,579
Always he is looking for it.

652
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:39,666
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

653
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:43,795
But we mustn't let him have it.

654
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:52,262
No! There's another way.

655
01:06:52,513 --> 01:06:55,140
More secret. A dark way.

656
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:59,144
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

657
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:00,604
He's up to something.

658
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:03,816
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

659
01:07:03,982 --> 01:07:06,735
Yes. There's a path...

660
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:09,363
...and some stairs.

661
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:11,240
And then...

662
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:14,785
...a tunnel.

663
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,592
He's led us this far, Sam.

664
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:32,135
Mr. Frodo, no.

665
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:34,763
He's been true to his word.

666
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:40,811
No.

667
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,565
Lead the way, Sméagol.

668
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:49,153
Good Sméagol always helps.

669
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:24,104
Hello?

670
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:28,567
Treebeard?

671
01:08:29,318 --> 01:08:30,611
Where has he gone?

672
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:33,280
I had the loveliest dream last night.

673
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:36,575
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

674
01:08:36,742 --> 01:08:39,244
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

675
01:08:39,786 --> 01:08:41,705
...you were sick.

676
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:46,126
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

677
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:51,590
Did you hear that?

678
01:08:58,639 --> 01:09:00,057
There it is again.

679
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:05,562
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

680
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:12,319
You just said something...Treeish.

681
01:09:12,486 --> 01:09:16,490
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

682
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:25,916
You're taller.

683
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:27,960
- Who?
- You!

684
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:29,753
- Than what?
- Than me!

685
01:09:30,254 --> 01:09:32,381
I've always been taller than you.

686
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:37,177
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

687
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:39,555
Please, Merry.

688
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:43,559
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

689
01:09:44,184 --> 01:09:46,979
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

690
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:51,400
3'8"!

691
01:09:53,318 --> 01:09:55,195
Three-foot-eight.

692
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,159
You did something.

693
01:10:05,956 --> 01:10:07,541
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

694
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,960
Merry!

695
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:12,504
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

696
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:16,550
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

697
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:18,886
Give me it back. Merry!

698
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:22,097
What's happening?!

699
01:10:22,973 --> 01:10:24,433
It's got my leg!

700
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:26,268
Merry!

701
01:10:45,662 --> 01:10:47,247
Help!

702
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:55,881
Away with you.

703
01:10:56,048 --> 01:10:57,841
You should not be waking.

704
01:10:58,383 --> 01:11:03,222
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

705
01:11:03,806 --> 01:11:06,391
Go to sleep.

706
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:08,602
Away with you.

707
01:11:08,769 --> 01:11:12,064
Come, the forest is waking up.

708
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:14,566
It isn't safe.

709
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:21,198
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

710
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:24,326
Anger festers in their hearts.

711
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:26,870
Black are their thoughts.

712
01:11:27,037 --> 01:11:29,540
Strong is their hate.

713
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:32,501
They will harm you if they can.

714
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:36,213
There are too few of us now.

715
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:40,384
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

716
01:11:41,051 --> 01:11:43,679
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

717
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:47,057
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

718
01:11:47,224 --> 01:11:52,855
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

719
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:58,318
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

720
01:11:58,527 --> 01:11:59,945
Oh, I'm sorry.

721
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:03,991
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

722
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:07,369
We lost them.

723
01:12:07,578 --> 01:12:12,624
And now we cannot find them.

724
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:19,047
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?
