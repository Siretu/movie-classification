1
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:18,138
<i>- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!</i>

2
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:28,352
<i>I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.</i>

3
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,060
<i>Go back to the Shadow.</i>

4
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:43,766
<i>The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!</i>

5
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,134
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,966
No! No!

7
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,142
Gandalf!

8
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,479
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,984
No!

10
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,015
Gandalf!

11
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,525
Gandalf!

12
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,760
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,430
Nothing.

14
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,769
Just a dream.

15
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,152
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,555
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

17
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,535
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,615
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,947
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,350
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,759
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,927
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,363
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,771
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,540
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,408
You never know.

27
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,816
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,455
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,715
It is special.

30
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,496
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,236
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

32
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,196
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,876
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,514
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,817
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,953
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,957
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:24,607
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,979
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,483
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,892
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,993
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

43
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,932
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

44
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,271
...but they did.

45
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,317
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,656
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,227
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,604
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

49
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,403
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,344
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,049
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,766
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,959
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:55,296
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

55
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,411
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,481
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,578
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,316
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,924
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,290
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,398
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

62
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,664
I can smell it.

63
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,341
We're not alone.

64
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:21,085
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,219
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,059
Where is it?

67
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,930
Where is it?

68
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,834
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:39,239
My precious.

70
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,377
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:47,645
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,539
This is Sting.

73
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,234
You've seen it before...

74
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,913
...haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,477
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,268
It burns!

77
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,771
It burns us!

78
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,711
It freezes!

79
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,778
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,611
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

81
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:34,288
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,054
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

83
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,821
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,696
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,429
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,278
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:01,584
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

88
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,585
Take it off us.

89
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,629
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,731
We swears.

91
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,467
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

92
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,900
We swears...

93
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:25,906
...to serve the master
of the precious.

94
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,878
We will swear on...

95
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,017
...on the precious.

96
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,379
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:38,683
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,856
Yes...

99
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,918
...on the precious.

100
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,732
On the precious.

101
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,392
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,897
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

103
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,838
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,003
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

105
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:17,953
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

106
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,629
You've been there before?

107
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,228
Yes.

108
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,776
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:51,227
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:56,198
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:56,368 --> 00:14:00,600
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,242
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

113
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:10,404
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,450
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:18,750
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

116
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:25,527
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,163
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,566
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,262
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,032
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,334
Follow me!

122
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,591
Merry!

123
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,051
Merry!

124
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,334
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

125
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,335
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:13,804
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,907
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,280
We will deliver them.

129
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,858
Merry!

130
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,358
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,698
My friend is sick.

132
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,798
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,508
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,407
Stop it!

135
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,245
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,482
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

137
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,391
You want some?

138
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,495
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,927
Merry.

140
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,328
Hello, Pip.

141
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,609
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

142
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,268
- It was just an act.
- An act?

143
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,814
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,248
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,548
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,823
Man-flesh.

147
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,329
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,559
Aragorn.

149
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,100
Let's move!

150
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:12,186
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,166
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,097
Hurry!

153
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,502
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,643
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,783
No food. No rest.

156
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,943
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,549
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

158
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,256
They may yet be alive.

159
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,722
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,823
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:27,301
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,105
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,584
Rohan.

164
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,554
Home of the Horse-lords.

165
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,320
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,466
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

167
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,602
Sets its will against us.

168
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,675
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,404
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,409
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,546
Saruman.

172
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,157
<i>The world is changing.</i>

173
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,927
<i>Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...</i>

174
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,367
<i>...and Mordor?</i>

175
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:41,706
<i>To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...</i>

176
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,509
<i>...and the union of the two towers?</i>

177
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,993
<i>Together, my Lord Sauron...</i>

178
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,687
<i>...we shall rule this Middle-earth.</i>

179
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,046
<i>The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.</i>

180
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,883
<i>The forests will fall.</i>

181
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,657
<i>A new order will rise.</i>

182
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:33,630
<i>We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...</i>

183
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,758
<i>...and the iron fists of the Orc.</i>

184
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,513
I want them armed and ready to march
within two weeks!

185
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,312
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,513
They cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

187
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,750
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,760
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

189
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:10,397
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

190
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,169
- Burn it.
- Yes.

191
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,204
We will fight for you.

192
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,344
Swear it.

193
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:34,622
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,718
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:42,424
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,034
Murderers!

197
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,063
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,035
Burn every village!

199
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:57,408
<i>We have only to remove those
who oppose us.</i>

200
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,408
<i>It will begin in Rohan.</i>

201
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,680
<i>Too long have these peasants
stood against you.</i>

202
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,653
<i>But no more.</i>

203
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,089
Éothain! Éothain!

204
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,925
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,961
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,796
He is too big for him.

207
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,973
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

208
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,665
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

209
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,877
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:31,777
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,383
Quickly!

212
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,354
Go, child.

213
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,144
<i>Rohan, my lord...</i>

214
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,343
<i>...is ready to fall.</i>

215
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,118
Théodred.

216
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,956
Find the king's son!

217
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:41,444
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,187
My Lord Éomer, over here!

219
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,796
He's alive.

220
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,691
Théodred.

221
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,106
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,008
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:53,183
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:56,049
That is a lie.

225
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:03,064
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

226
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,727
Gríma.

227
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,107
Gríma.

228
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,134
Gríma.

229
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:18,006
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

230
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:22,011
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

231
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,588
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:39,199
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,872
Can you not see?

234
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:47,068
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

235
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,804
...your warmongering.

236
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,985
Warmongering?

237
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,313
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

238
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,521
What was the promised price, Gríma?

239
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:03,353
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

240
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,468
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,645
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,054
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

243
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,384
Too much.

244
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:41,529
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

245
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,501
...and all its domains
under pain of death.

246
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,304
You have no authority here.

247
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,942
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:56,311
This order does not come from me.

249
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,642
It comes from the king.

250
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,844
He signed it this morning.

251
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,114
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,049
Breathe.

253
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,994
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,172
We're not going no further...

255
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,340
...until we've had a breather.

256
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,853
Get a fire going!

257
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,482
Merry!

258
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,190
Merry!

259
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:23,095
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,772
What's making that noise?

261
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:37,814
It's the trees.

262
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,608
What?

263
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:43,785
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:48,449
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

265
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,150
...and come alive.

266
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,090
Alive?

267
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,659
Trees that could whisper...

268
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,135
...talk to each other...

269
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,100
...even move.

270
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,970
I'm starving.

271
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:08,203
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

272
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,842
Yeah!

273
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:13,313
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,882
What about them?

275
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,956
They're fresh.

276
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:24,391
They are not for eating.

277
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,336
What about their legs?

278
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,835
They don't need those.

279
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,504
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

280
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:46,215
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,518
Alive?

282
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:55,755
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

283
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,530
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

284
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,725
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,504
They think we have the Ring.

286
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:12,108
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

287
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,946
Just a mouthful...

288
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,308
...a bit of the flank.

289
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,683
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

290
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,561
Pippin.

291
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,428
Let's go.

292
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,367
Go on.

293
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,046
Call for help.

294
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,540
Squeal.

295
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,912
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,494
Pippin!

297
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,278
A red sun rises.

298
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,725
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,756
Riders of Rohan...

300
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,627
...what news from the Mark?

301
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,793
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:45,857
Speak quickly!

303
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:50,861
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,536
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

305
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,347
...if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

306
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,443
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,061
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:23,595
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,999
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

310
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,506
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

311
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,939
Not even his own kin.

312
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,418
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

313
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,520
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,482
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,422
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,796
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,867
He walks here and there, they say...

318
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,004
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,706
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

320
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,108
We are no spies.

321
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,215
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,849
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

323
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,121
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:21,452
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:24,595
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

326
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,923
We left none alive.

327
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,537
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,238
Dead?

329
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,942
I am sorry.

330
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,819
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:59,289
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,090
Farewell.

333
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,535
Look for your friends.

334
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,237
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,505
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,705
We ride north!

337
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,131
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,974
We failed them.

339
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,193
A Hobbit lay here.

340
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,729
And the other.

341
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,140
They crawled.

342
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,347
Their hands were bound.

343
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,332
Their bonds were cut.

344
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,946
They ran over here.

345
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,785
They were followed.

346
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,725
The belt!

347
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:51,761
Run!

348
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:56,837
Tracks lead away from the battle...

349
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,739
...into Fangorn Forest.

350
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,082
Fangorn?

351
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,878
What madness drove them in there?

352
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,629
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

353
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,783
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

354
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,012
Come here!

355
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,090
Trees. Climb a tree.

356
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,137
He's gone.

357
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,554
Merry!

358
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:36,439
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

359
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,105
Run, Merry!

360
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:59,226
Little Orcs.

361
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,729
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

362
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,799
Tree?

363
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,960
I am no tree!

364
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,365
I am an Ent.

365
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,067
A tree-herder.

366
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,611
A shepherd of the forest.

367
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,144
Don't talk to it, Merry.

368
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,114
Don't encourage it!

369
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:22,547
Treebeard, some call me.

370
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,688
And whose side are you on?

371
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,916
Side?

372
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,991
I am on nobody's side...

373
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:35,697
...because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

374
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,130
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

375
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,939
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

376
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,406
Hobbits?

377
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:52,514
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

378
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:58,211
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

379
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,516
They come with fire.

380
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,284
They come with axes.

381
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:08,295
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

382
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:12,299
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

383
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,369
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

384
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,370
Halflings!

385
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,633
Shire-folk!

386
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,175
Maybe you are...

387
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,108
...and maybe you aren't.

388
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:30,119
The White Wizard will know.

389
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,855
The White Wizard?

390
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,881
Saruman.

391
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,133
See? See?

392
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,774
We've led you out.

393
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,434
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

394
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:01,017
Very lucky we find you.

395
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,420
Nice Hobbit.

396
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:15,594
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

397
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,394
A swamp, yes, yes.

398
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:23,868
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

399
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,646
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

400
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:35,545
I found it. I did.

401
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,415
The way through the marshes.

402
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:42,114
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

403
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:46,387
They go around for miles and miles.

404
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,030
Come quickly.

405
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:52,293
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

406
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,803
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

407
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,238
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

408
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,777
No, no birdses to eat.

409
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:07,245
No crunchable birdses.

410
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,718
We are famished! Yes!

411
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:15,188
Famished we are, precious!

412
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,664
Here.

413
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,867
What does it eats?

414
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,047
Is it tasty?

415
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,947
It tries to chokes us!

416
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,885
We can't eats Hobbit food!

417
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:54,621
We must starve!

418
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,164
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

419
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,130
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

420
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:03,170
It does not care if we be hungry.

421
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:08,140
Does not care if we should die.

422
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:11,612
Not like master.

423
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,076
Master cares.

424
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,118
Master knows.

425
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,559
Yes.

426
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,354
Precious.

427
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:32,561
Once it takes hold of us...

428
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:38,602
...it never lets go.

429
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,469
Don't touch me!

430
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,808
There are dead things!

431
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,741
Dead faces in the water.

432
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:25,544
All dead. All rotten.

433
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,822
Elves and Men and Orcses.

434
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:33,656
A great battle long ago.

435
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,194
Dead Marshes.

436
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,130
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

437
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,567
This way.

438
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,537
Don't follow the lights.

439
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:51,145
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

440
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:55,444
...and light little candles
of their own.

441
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,112
Frodo!

442
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:12,255
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

443
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,294
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

444
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,329
Are you all right?

445
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:48,198
So bright.

446
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:52,198
So beautiful.

447
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:56,237
Our precious.

448
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,198
What did you say?

449
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,570
Master should be resting.

450
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:05,806
Master needs to keep up his strength.

451
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:11,049
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

452
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,711
Gollum. Gollum.

453
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,687
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

454
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:18,954
<i>Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home</i>

455
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:20,687
He said your life was a sad story.

456
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:25,426
<i>They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead</i>

457
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,594
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

458
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,534
Were you?

459
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:35,006
Sméagol.

460
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,241
What did you call me?

461
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,351
That was your name once, wasn't it?

462
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,290
A long time ago.

463
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,288
My name.

464
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:54,853
My name.

465
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,206
Sméagol.

466
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:09,972
Black Riders!

467
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,478
Hide! Hide!

468
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,357
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

469
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:28,157
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

470
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,594
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

471
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,737
No, you cannot kill them. No.

472
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:02,990
Wraiths!

473
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,395
Wraiths on wings!

474
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,435
They are calling for it.

475
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,206
They are calling for the precious.

476
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,478
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

477
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:24,915
I'm here.

478
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:42,461
Hurry, Hobbits.

479
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,976
The Black Gate is very close.

480
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,715
Orc blood.

481
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,425
These are strange tracks.

482
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,723
The air is so close in here.

483
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,302
This forest is old.

484
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,096
Very old.

485
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,173
Full of memory...

486
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,112
...and anger.

487
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:35,190
The trees are speaking to each other.

488
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:36,848
Gimli!

489
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,961
Lower your ax.

490
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,529
They have feelings, my friend.

491
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:47,059
The Elves began it.

492
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:52,003
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

493
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,875
Talking trees.

494
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:58,538
What do trees have to talk about?

495
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:01,878
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

496
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,266
The White Wizard approaches.

497
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:28,774
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

498
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,619
We must be quick.

499
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:59,835
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

500
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,809
Where are they?

501
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:05,539
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

502
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:09,981
They met someone they did not expect.

503
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:12,280
Does that comfort you?

504
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:14,423
Who are you?

505
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,860
Show yourself!

506
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,761
It cannot be.

507
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:32,708
Forgive me.

508
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,311
I mistook you for Saruman.

509
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,844
I am Saruman.

510
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:45,252
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

511
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,713
You fell.

512
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,717
Through fire...

513
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,192
...and water.

514
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,189
<i>From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...</i>

515
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:01,064
<i>...I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.</i>

516
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,650
<i>Until at last I threw down
my enemy...</i>

517
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:24,283
<i>...and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.</i>

518
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,860
<i>Darkness took me...</i>

519
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:37,698
<i>...and I strayed out of thought
and time.</i>

520
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:41,535
<i>Stars wheeled overhead...</i>

521
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:46,305
<i>...and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.</i>

522
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,578
<i>But it was not the end.</i>

523
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,653
<i>I felt life in me again.</i>

524
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:58,117
<i>I've been sent back...</i>

525
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,853
...until my task is done.

526
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,130
Gandalf.

527
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,790
Gandalf?

528
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,998
Yes.

529
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,603
That was what they used to call me.

530
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,741
Gandalf the Grey.

531
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:19,844
That was my name.

532
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:21,449
Gandalf.

533
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,479
I am Gandalf the White.

534
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:31,585
And I come back to you now...

535
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:34,252
...at the turn of the tide.

536
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:38,334
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

537
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:42,265
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

538
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:45,231
That is no short distance!

539
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,739
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

540
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:51,005
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

541
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,617
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

542
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:56,775
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

543
00:55:56,953 --> 00:56:01,117
...in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?

544
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,890
I mean, charming...

545
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:09,793
...quite charming forest.

546
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:13,996
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

547
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:18,573
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

548
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:22,178
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

549
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:25,678
...that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

550
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,841
I n one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

551
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:32,613
You still speak in riddles.

552
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:41,863
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

553
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:45,660
The Ents are going to wake up...

554
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:50,696
...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

555
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:52,634
Oh, that's good.

556
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,538
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

557
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:58,876
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

558
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:02,643
I n fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

559
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:06,550
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

560
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,278
That is one of the Mearas...

561
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,245
...unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

562
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:53,131
Shadowfax.

563
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,333
He is the lord of all horses...

564
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:03,844
...and has been my friend
through many dangers.

565
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:21,689
<i>O rowan mine</i>

566
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:25,665
<i>I saw you shine</i>

567
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:29,362
<i>Upon a summer's day</i>

568
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:34,933
<i>Upon your head
How golden-red</i>

569
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:39,877
<i>The crown you bore aloft</i>

570
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,449
Such a beautiful verse.

571
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:47,522
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

572
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,955
You might call it far, perhaps.

573
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:55,661
My home lies deep in the forest...

574
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:59,767
...near the roots of the mountain.

575
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,700
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

576
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:08,900
And safe is where I'll keep you.

577
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:13,547
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

578
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,942
It's one of my own compositions.

579
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,314
Right.

580
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:24,620
<i>Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves</i>

581
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:29,663
<i>And the dreams of trees unfold</i>

582
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:36,294
<i>When woodland halls are green and cool</i>

583
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:40,567
<i>And the wind is in the West</i>

584
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:43,706
<i>Come back to me</i>

585
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:48,707
<i>Come back to me</i>

586
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:55,313
<i>And say my land is best</i>

587
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:06,428
Sleep, little Shirelings.

588
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,198
Heed no nightly noise.

589
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:14,308
Sleep till morning light.

590
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:20,109
I have business in the forest.

591
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:25,812
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

592
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:31,720
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

593
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:37,730
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

594
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:51,442
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

595
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:54,842
Sauron will suffer no rival.

596
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:59,550
From the summit of Barad-dûr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

597
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:03,089
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

598
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,095
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

599
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:08,822
The rumor has reached him.

600
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,967
The heir of Númenor still lives.

601
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:15,768
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

602
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,267
He fears what you may become.

603
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:23,979
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

604
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:27,776
He will use his puppet Saruman
to destroy Rohan.

605
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,440
War is coming.

606
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:33,180
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

607
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,790
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

608
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:39,655
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

609
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:42,923
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

610
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:47,798
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

611
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,765
But for all their cunning...

612
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:53,498
...we have one advantage.

613
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:58,238
The Ring remains hidden.

614
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,182
And that we should seek to destroy it...

615
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,319
...has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

616
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:08,220
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

617
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,881
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

618
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:14,155
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

619
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,958
We must trust now in Frodo.

620
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:18,964
Everything depends upon speed...

621
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,127
...and the secrecy of his quest.

622
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:27,440
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

623
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:31,075
Frodo must finish this task alone.

624
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:34,146
He's not alone.

625
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:36,012
Sam went with him.

626
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:37,880
Did he?

627
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:42,684
Did he, indeed? Good.

628
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,726
Yes, very good.

629
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:58,639
The Black Gate of Mordor.

630
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,845
Oh, save us.

631
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:12,883
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

632
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:19,584
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

633
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:23,198
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

634
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:24,594
I did.

635
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,367
That's it, then.

636
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,243
We can't get past that.

637
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:24,757
Look!

638
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:26,394
The gate.

639
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:27,756
It's opening!

640
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,172
I can see a way down.

641
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:40,000
Sam, no!

642
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,576
Master!

643
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:10,890
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

644
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,830
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

645
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:17,136
- Now!
- No!

646
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,675
No! No, master!

647
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,844
They catch you! They catch you!

648
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,706
Don't take it to him.

649
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,382
He wants the precious.

650
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:35,581
Always he is looking for it.

651
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:39,660
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

652
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:43,797
But we mustn't let him have it.

653
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,299
No! There's another way.

654
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,170
More secret. A dark way.

655
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:59,141
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

656
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:00,639
He's up to something.

657
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,844
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

658
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,750
Yes. There's a path...

659
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,413
...and some stairs.

660
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,286
And then...

661
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,793
...a tunnel.

662
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,608
He's led us this far, Sam.

663
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,179
Mr. Frodo, no.

664
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:34,782
He's been true to his word.

665
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:40,849
No.

666
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:44,619
Lead the way, Sméagol.

667
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:49,163
Good Sméagol always helps.

668
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,121
Hello?

669
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,594
Treebeard?

670
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:30,636
Where has he gone?

671
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,274
I had the loveliest dream last night.

672
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:36,605
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

673
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,270
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

674
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,716
...you were sick.

675
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:46,152
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

676
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,592
Did you hear that?

677
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,066
There it is again.

678
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:05,599
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

679
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:12,346
You just said something... Treeish.

680
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:16,508
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

681
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:25,924
You're taller.

682
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:27,952
- Who?
- You!

683
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,757
- Than what?
- Than me!

684
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:32,393
I've always been taller than you.

685
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:37,198
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

686
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:39,563
Please, Merry.

687
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:43,609
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

688
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,013
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

689
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:51,415
3'8"!

690
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,186
Three-foot-eight.

691
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,160
You did something.

692
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:07,560
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

693
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:09,971
Merry!

694
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:12,504
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

695
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:16,577
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

696
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,906
Give me it back. Merry!

697
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,114
What's happening?!

698
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:24,452
It's got my leg!

699
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:26,277
Merry!

700
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,266
Help!

701
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,914
Away with you.

702
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,882
You should not be waking.

703
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:03,256
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

704
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:06,419
Go to sleep.

705
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,627
Away with you.

706
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:12,096
Come, the forest is waking up.

707
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:14,602
It isn't safe.

708
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:21,209
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

709
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,369
Anger festers in their hearts.

710
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:26,874
Black are their thoughts.

711
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:29,574
Strong is their hate.

712
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:32,516
They will harm you if they can.

713
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:36,249
There are too few of us now.

714
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:40,418
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

715
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:43,691
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

716
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:47,063
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

717
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:52,868
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

718
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:58,308
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

719
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,979
Oh, I'm sorry.

720
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:04,018
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

721
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:07,417
We lost them.

722
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:12,652
And now we cannot find them.

723
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:19,063
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?
