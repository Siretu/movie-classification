2
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:10,997
I shall tell you of William Wallace.

3
00:01:12,135 --> 00:01:15,002
Historians from England will say I am a liar.

4
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:19,469
But history is written by those
who have hanged heroes.

5
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:25,370
The King of Scotland had died without a son.
And the King of England,

6
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:29,316
a cruel pagan known as
Edward the Longshanks,

7
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:33,422
claimed the throne of Scotland for himself.

8
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,391
Scotland's nobles fought him

9
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:39,519
and fought each other over the crown.

10
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:43,893
So Longshanks invited them
to talks of a truce.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,935
No weapons. One page only.

12
00:01:51,307 --> 00:01:56,006
One farmer of that shire was Malcolm
Wallace, a commoner with his own lands.

13
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,310
He had two sons: John and William.

14
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:08,249
I told you to stay.

15
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:12,451
Well, I finished my work.
Where are we going?

16
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:15,760
MacAndrews'. He was supposed
to visit after the gathering.

17
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:17,890
- Can I come?
- No. Go home, boy.

18
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:21,698
- But I want to go.
- Go home, or you'll feel the back of my hand.

19
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:24,501
Away hame, William.

20
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:50,590
MacAndrews.

21
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,874
Holy Jesus.

22
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:53,520
William.

23
00:03:57,133 --> 00:04:00,034
It's all right, it's all right. Easy, lad.

24
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:17,610
William.

25
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:21,982
And I say we hit back now.

26
00:04:22,058 --> 00:04:25,027
- We cann't fight them.
- Something's got to be done.

27
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:28,257
Wallace is right. We fight them.

28
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:31,162
Every nobleman willing to fight
was at that meeting.

29
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:34,601
We cannot beat an army.
Not with the 50 farmers we can raise.

30
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:37,765
We do not have to beat them...
Just fight them.

31
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:41,105
- Now, who's with me?
- I am, Wallace.

32
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:44,907
- All right.
- Aye.

33
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,855
- Where do you think you're going?
- With you.

34
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:06,527
Och, are ye? And what are you going to do?

35
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:10,003
- I'm gonna help.
- Aye, and a good help you'll be, too.

36
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,305
But I need you to stay here

37
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,504
and look after the place for me
while I'm away.

38
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:21,809
I can fight.

39
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,151
I know. I know you can fight.

40
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:34,922
But it's our wits that make us men.

41
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:42,095
See ye tomorrow.

42
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:15,502
- English.
- Get down.

43
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:19,940
With your father and brother gone,
they'll kill us and burn the farm.

44
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,669
It's up to us, Hamish.

45
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:29,435
Da?

46
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,517
William.

47
00:08:54,263 --> 00:08:56,322
Come here, lad.

48
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:23,867
William.

49
00:12:25,674 --> 00:12:28,575
I'm your uncle. Argyle.

50
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:43,650
You have the look of your mother.

51
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:58,567
We'll stay here tonight.
Tomorrow, you'll come home with me.

52
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:01,601
I don't want to leave.

53
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:05,812
You didn't want your father
to die either, did you?

54
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:07,974
But it happened.

55
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,948
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

56
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:17,390
- The Lord bless thee and keep thee...
- It was in Latin.

57
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:20,487
You don't speak Latin?

58
00:13:21,797 --> 00:13:24,322
That's something we shall have to remedy.

59
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,831
The Lord

60
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:31,998
bless thee and keep thee.

61
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,305
The Lord cause his light to shine on thee.

62
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:38,906
The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee

63
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:41,407
and give thee peace.

64
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:44,243
Amen.

65
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:52,319
Your heart is free.

66
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:55,722
Have the courage to follow it.

67
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:25,385
What are they doing?

68
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:27,554
Saying goodbye in their own way.

69
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:32,033
Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.

70
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:46,775
It was the same for me and your daddy
when our father was killed.

71
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:17,235
First, learn to use...

72
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,207
this.

73
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:22,341
Then I'll teach you... to use

74
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:25,945
this.

75
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,109
Many years later,

76
00:15:57,252 --> 00:16:00,483
Edward the Longshanks, King of England,

77
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:04,993
supervised the wedding of his eldest son,
who would succeed him as king.

78
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:09,491
Amen.

79
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:15,262
As bride for his son,

80
00:16:15,337 --> 00:16:18,738
Longshanks had chosen
the daughter of his rival,

81
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:20,900
the King of France.

82
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:47,561
It was widely whispered
that for the Princess to conceive,

83
00:16:47,636 --> 00:16:50,969
Longshanks would have
to do the honors himself.

84
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:55,565
That may have been
what he had in mind all along.

85
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:01,574
Scotland...

86
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:04,144
My land.

87
00:17:05,354 --> 00:17:10,053
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength.

88
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:15,529
But how will they believe our strength
when we cannot rule the whole of our island?

89
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:30,539
- Where is my son?
- Your pardon, my Lord.

90
00:17:30,612 --> 00:17:32,978
He asked me to come in his stead.

91
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:35,482
I sent for him and he sends you?

92
00:17:36,218 --> 00:17:38,345
Shall I leave, my Lord?

93
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:42,755
If he wants his queen to rule when I am gone,

94
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:47,023
then by all means stay and learn how. Please.

95
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,859
Nobles.

96
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:57,200
Nobles are the key to the door of Scotland.

97
00:17:57,306 --> 00:18:01,003
Grant our nobles lands in the North.

98
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:07,072
Give their nobles estates here in England.
And make them too greedy to oppose us.

99
00:18:07,182 --> 00:18:10,310
But, sir, our nobles
will be reluctant to uproot.

100
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:14,879
New lands mean new taxes and they're
already taxed for the war in France.

101
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,049
Are they?

102
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,119
Are they?

103
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:40,141
The trouble with Scotland

104
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:42,149
is that it's full of Scots.

105
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:49,351
Perhaps the time has come

106
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,892
to reinstitute an old custom.

107
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:55,328
Grant them primae noctis.

108
00:18:58,033 --> 00:19:03,335
First night. When any common girl
inhabiting their lands is married,

109
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:08,774
our nobles shall have sexual rights to her
on the night of her wedding.

110
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,673
If we can't get them out,

111
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:16,911
we'll breed them out.

112
00:19:17,686 --> 00:19:21,850
That should fetch just the kind
of lords we want to Scotland.

113
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:23,983
Taxes or no taxes?

114
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:26,117
A most excellent idea, sire.

115
00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:28,288
Is it?

116
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:37,370
Now, in Edinburgh were gathered
the council of Scottish nobles.

117
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:41,704
Among these was Robert,
the 17th Earl of Bruce,

118
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:45,812
a leading contender
for the crown of Scotland.

119
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:55,148
I hear that Longshanks
has granted primae noctis.

120
00:19:55,224 --> 00:19:58,489
Clearly meant to draw
more of his supporters here.

121
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:03,595
My father believes we must lull
Longshanks into our confidence

122
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:06,725
by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.

123
00:20:06,802 --> 00:20:10,738
- A wise plan.
- How is your father? He missed the council.

124
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:13,798
His affairs in France keep him long overdue.

125
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:20,740
But he sends his greetings.

126
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:23,909
And he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces

127
00:20:23,986 --> 00:20:26,045
and for Scotland.

128
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:41,081
- You've dropped your rock.
- A test of manhood.

129
00:22:43,358 --> 00:22:45,690
You win.

130
00:22:46,895 --> 00:22:48,954
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

131
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:52,994
The English won't let us train with weapons,
so we use stones.

132
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:56,901
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.
It's here.

133
00:22:56,972 --> 00:22:59,270
No. It's here.

134
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:08,340
Hamish?

135
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:23,523
Here you go, son. Show him how.

136
00:23:23,598 --> 00:23:25,930
- Come on, Hamish.
- Come on, boy.

137
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:30,537
Come on.

138
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:44,776
That's a good throw.

139
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,912
Aye. Aye, it was.

140
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:51,122
I was wondering
if you could do that when it matters.

141
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:55,454
As it... as it matters in battle.

142
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:00,331
Could you crush a man with that throw?

143
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:02,734
I could crush you... like a worm.

144
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,173
- You could?
- Aye.

145
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:11,436
Well, then, do it.
Like to see him crush me like a worm?

146
00:24:15,784 --> 00:24:17,979
- Come and do it.
- You'll move.

147
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:21,147
- I will not.
- Right.

148
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:22,747
He'll move.

149
00:24:22,824 --> 00:24:24,758
Come on, Hamish.

150
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:28,220
Come on there, boy.

151
00:24:36,238 --> 00:24:37,364
Well done.

152
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:54,681
- A fine display.
- Are you all right?

153
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:59,720
- You look a wee bit shaky.
- I should have remembered the rocks.

154
00:24:59,828 --> 00:25:00,852
Aye.

155
00:25:06,668 --> 00:25:08,693
Get up, you big heap of...

156
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:12,664
- It's good to see ye again.
- Aye, welcome home.

157
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:18,801
- Look what you did to my head.
- You should have moved.

158
00:25:28,823 --> 00:25:31,417
William, will you dance with me?

159
00:25:32,427 --> 00:25:34,486
Of course I will.

160
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:02,381
I've come to claim the right
of primae noctis.

161
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:08,486
As lord of these lands, I will bless this
marriage by taking the bride into my bed

162
00:26:08,897 --> 00:26:11,457
on the first night of her union.

163
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:12,966
By God you will not!

164
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:19,298
It is my noble right.

165
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:24,057
- Good evening, sir.
- Ah, young Wallace.

166
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:28,261
- A grand soft evening.
- Aye, it's that.

167
00:28:28,336 --> 00:28:30,600
Might I have a word with your daughter?

168
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,339
What do you want to have a word about?

169
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:36,603
Well...

170
00:28:36,678 --> 00:28:40,273
Murron, would you like to ride with me
on this fine evening?

171
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:45,511
In this? You're out of your mind.

172
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,920
It's good Scottish weather, madam.
The rain is falling almost straight down.

173
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:52,618
- She cann't go with you.
- No?

174
00:28:52,694 --> 00:28:55,162
No. No the now, anyway.

175
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:56,958
- No the now.
- No the now.

176
00:28:57,065 --> 00:29:00,865
- We'll see ye later.
- The weather's fine. It's hardly raining.

177
00:29:00,935 --> 00:29:03,028
Did you no hear what I said?

178
00:29:03,505 --> 00:29:05,564
Murron.

179
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:10,168
It's you she takes after.

180
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,276
- How did you know me after so long?
- I didn't.

181
00:29:44,312 --> 00:29:47,475
I saw you staring at me
and I didn't know who you were.

182
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:49,608
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

183
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,321
Are you in the habit of riding off
with strangers?

184
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,824
It was the best way to make you leave.

185
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:05,031
If I ever find the courage to ask ye again,
I'll warn you in writing first.

186
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:07,795
- It wouldn't help. I can't read.
- Can ye not?

187
00:30:07,902 --> 00:30:10,029
No.

188
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,040
- That's something we shall have to remedy.
- You'll teach me to read?

189
00:30:16,144 --> 00:30:18,203
- Aye, if you like.
- Aye.

190
00:30:19,414 --> 00:30:23,407
- In what language?
- You're showing off now.

191
00:30:23,551 --> 00:30:26,714
- That's right. Are you impressed yet?
- No. Should I be?

192
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,866
Do that standing on your head,
and I'll be impressed.

193
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:43,194
- My kilt'll fly up, but I'll try.
- You learnt no manners on your travels.

194
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:46,263
The French and the Romans
are far worse than I.

195
00:30:46,374 --> 00:30:49,468
- You went to Rome?
- Uncle took me on a pilgrimage.

196
00:30:49,577 --> 00:30:51,636
What was it like?

197
00:30:56,351 --> 00:30:58,410
What does that mean?

198
00:30:58,653 --> 00:31:00,746
Beautiful.

199
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:05,384
But I belong here.

200
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:40,085
Murron. Come in now.

201
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:55,959
Sir, I know it was strange of me
to invite Murron to ride last night, but...

202
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,504
MacClannough's daughter is another matter.

203
00:32:58,573 --> 00:33:03,010
- I've come to fetch you to a meeting.
- What kind of meeting?

204
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:06,478
- The secret kind.
- Your meetings are a waste of time.

205
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,409
Your father was a fighter

206
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:14,145
and a patriot.

207
00:33:15,556 --> 00:33:17,615
I know who my father was.

208
00:33:18,726 --> 00:33:21,991
I came home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.

209
00:33:24,332 --> 00:33:27,096
- If I can live in peace, I will.
- Go on.

210
00:33:27,168 --> 00:33:29,932
- You want to stay out of the troubles?
- Aye.

211
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:33,167
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

212
00:33:33,241 --> 00:33:35,334
Until you prove it, the answer is no.

213
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,106
- No.
- No, Wallace. No.

214
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:41,345
- Didn't I just prove it?
- No.

215
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:43,509
- No?
- No!

216
00:34:25,293 --> 00:34:28,262
Of course, running a farm is a lot of work.

217
00:34:28,362 --> 00:34:31,627
But that will all change when my sons arrive.

218
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:34,626
So, you've got children.

219
00:34:34,702 --> 00:34:38,763
Well, not yet. But I was hoping
that you could help me with that.

220
00:34:39,107 --> 00:34:40,404
So you want me to marry you, then?

221
00:34:40,475 --> 00:34:43,035
Well, it's a bit sudden, but all right.

222
00:34:43,111 --> 00:34:45,079
Is that what you call a proposal?

223
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:49,679
I love you. Always have.

224
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:53,779
I want to marry you.

225
00:35:05,466 --> 00:35:07,457
Is that a yes?

226
00:35:07,535 --> 00:35:09,628
- Aye, that's a yes.
- Yeah?

227
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,574
- We'd best hurry. He'll be waiting.
- Oh, wait.

228
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:57,742
Where are you going?

229
00:36:03,324 --> 00:36:05,383
- What's that?
- You'll see.

230
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:26,672
Father.

231
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:40,886
I will love you my whole life.

232
00:36:42,363 --> 00:36:44,422
You and no other.

233
00:36:49,203 --> 00:36:51,433
And I you.

234
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:53,598
You and no other... for ever.

235
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:24,709
When will I see ye again? Tonight?

236
00:40:24,785 --> 00:40:27,015
- I can't.
- Why not?

237
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:28,850
My dad's growing suspicious.

238
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:31,754
Would that have anything to do with...

239
00:40:31,826 --> 00:40:33,919
When?

240
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:36,853
When?

241
00:40:36,964 --> 00:40:39,023
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

242
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:48,432
Look lively, Sergeant.

243
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,879
What are you carrying, lassie?

244
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:05,152
- That looks heavy. Can we help you?
- That's fine.

245
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:07,352
I'm not going to steal it...

246
00:41:08,362 --> 00:41:11,593
Oh. You remind me
of my daughter back home.

247
00:41:25,713 --> 00:41:27,180
Hello, lassie.

248
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:48,867
Keep quiet, Smythe.

249
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:53,736
You bitch.

250
00:42:01,448 --> 00:42:02,676
You bitch.

251
00:42:11,025 --> 00:42:13,084
Are you all right?

252
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:19,090
- Are you all right?
- Aye.

253
00:42:29,143 --> 00:42:31,236
- Can you ride?
- Aye.

254
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:38,179
Come back here, you bastard!

255
00:42:38,953 --> 00:42:41,717
Ring the alarm. Help!

256
00:42:42,756 --> 00:42:45,054
Meet me at the grove. Ride!

257
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,093
They're getting away.

258
00:43:30,004 --> 00:43:32,097
All right, you bitch.

259
00:43:54,995 --> 00:43:57,054
Murron.

260
00:44:13,847 --> 00:44:18,784
All of you know full well
the great pains I've always taken

261
00:44:19,853 --> 00:44:23,949
never to be too strict, too rigid,
with the application of our laws.

262
00:44:25,092 --> 00:44:27,185
And, as a consequence,

263
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:30,424
have we not learned to live together

264
00:44:30,497 --> 00:44:33,057
in relative peace and harmony?

265
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:35,032
Huh?

266
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:44,600
And this... day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency.

267
00:44:53,721 --> 00:44:55,814
You leave me with little choice.

268
00:45:04,064 --> 00:45:06,225
An assault on the King's soldiers

269
00:45:07,468 --> 00:45:10,631
is the same as an assault
on the King himself.

270
00:45:27,254 --> 00:45:29,085
Now,

271
00:45:29,156 --> 00:45:32,023
let this scrapper come to me.

272
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:29,476
There.

273
00:49:55,922 --> 00:49:58,482
Corporal. Some archers on the tower. Now!

274
00:50:09,002 --> 00:50:11,300
Hold still, Father.

275
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:13,703
You idiot, boy.

276
00:51:37,624 --> 00:51:40,218
- Father, are you all right?
- Aye.

277
00:53:03,076 --> 00:53:04,737
MacCaulich.

278
00:53:19,926 --> 00:53:22,520
Wallace.

279
00:55:45,105 --> 00:55:47,164
What are you waiting for, boy?

280
00:55:48,274 --> 00:55:50,970
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

281
00:55:52,879 --> 00:55:56,440
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

282
00:55:56,516 --> 00:55:58,575
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

283
00:55:58,685 --> 00:56:01,586
I know it seems like
a waste of good whisky. Indulge me.

284
00:56:05,558 --> 00:56:09,392
Hold him. Hold him. Hold him. Now,

285
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:11,088
let him go.

286
00:56:15,535 --> 00:56:17,127
All right?

287
00:56:17,203 --> 00:56:19,967
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

288
00:56:20,073 --> 00:56:22,667
- There's somebody coming.
- Arm yourselves.

289
00:56:29,382 --> 00:56:31,475
There's somebody coming.

290
00:56:32,085 --> 00:56:35,577
MacGregors. From the next glen.

291
00:56:40,693 --> 00:56:42,957
We heard about what was happening.

292
00:56:43,029 --> 00:56:47,489
We don't want you amerdans
thinking you can have your fun without us.

293
00:56:49,102 --> 00:56:51,036
Go home.

294
00:56:51,137 --> 00:56:53,196
Some of us are in this.

295
00:56:54,307 --> 00:56:58,141
I can't help that now.
But you can help yourselves.

296
00:56:58,211 --> 00:56:59,906
Go home.

297
00:56:59,979 --> 00:57:04,040
We'll have no homes left
when the English garrison burns us out.

298
00:57:05,251 --> 00:57:09,051
- And they will.
- Aye.

299
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:11,982
Welcome.

300
00:57:41,454 --> 00:57:43,547
Patrol returning, my Lord.

301
00:58:11,384 --> 00:58:13,079
So, what news?

302
00:58:24,697 --> 00:58:29,066
I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark.
They will be returning now.

303
00:58:29,135 --> 00:58:31,296
Were they dressed like this?

304
00:58:33,072 --> 00:58:35,267
Actually, it was more like 50.

305
00:58:35,842 --> 00:58:37,901
Make it quick.

306
00:58:40,213 --> 00:58:42,272
Do you remember me?

307
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:49,412
- I never did her any harm. It was my right.
- I'm here to claim the right of a husband!

308
00:58:56,696 --> 00:58:58,755
I'm William Wallace.

309
00:59:00,433 --> 00:59:02,492
And the rest of you will be spared.

310
00:59:03,469 --> 00:59:06,029
Go back to England.

311
00:59:06,105 --> 00:59:11,099
And tell them there that Scotland's
daughters and her sons are yours no more.

312
00:59:13,246 --> 00:59:15,305
Tell them Scotland is free.

313
00:59:21,254 --> 00:59:22,278
Burn it.

314
00:59:56,589 --> 01:00:00,685
The Scottish rebels
have routed one of my garrisons

315
01:00:01,394 --> 01:00:03,726
and murdered the noble Lord.

316
01:00:03,796 --> 01:00:07,493
I heard.
This Wallace is a brigand, nothing more.

317
01:00:07,567 --> 01:00:11,025
And how would you deal with this... brigand?

318
01:00:11,137 --> 01:00:15,233
Like any common thief. Have the
local magistrate arrest and punish him.

319
01:00:19,312 --> 01:00:20,939
Leave us.

320
01:00:30,923 --> 01:00:36,156
Wallace has already killed the magistrate
and taken control of the town.

321
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:38,588
Stand up.

322
01:00:38,665 --> 01:00:40,428
Stand up!

323
01:00:41,434 --> 01:00:43,527
In the morning,

324
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:47,168
I depart for France to press our rights there.

325
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,266
And I leave you here
to quell this little rebellion.

326
01:00:50,376 --> 01:00:53,277
Understood? Is it?

327
01:00:56,149 --> 01:00:58,549
One day you will be a king.

328
01:01:00,386 --> 01:01:02,445
At least try to act like one.

329
01:01:06,793 --> 01:01:08,852
Get away from me.

330
01:01:09,295 --> 01:01:11,763
Convene my military council.

331
01:01:52,705 --> 01:01:54,195
There.

332
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:57,873
After them.

333
01:02:24,771 --> 01:02:28,366
No point resisting.
You're outnumbered and trapped.

334
01:02:28,474 --> 01:02:31,841
Where are the rest of you? Where's Wallace?
