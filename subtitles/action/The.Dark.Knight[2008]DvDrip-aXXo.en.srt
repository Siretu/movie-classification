1
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,599
Three of a kind, let's do this.
- That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,007
Two guys on the roof. Every guy
gets a share. Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,007
Six shares. Don't forget the
guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,835
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,992
- I know why they call him the Joker.
- Why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,912
I heard he wears makeup.
- Makeup?

7
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,957
Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,072
All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,113
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,113
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,759
- I said, hands up!
- No!

12
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,270
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,714
And there it goes.

14
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,029
Heads down!

15
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,430
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,160
- Down! I said, stay down there!
- Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,278
Funny, it didn't dial 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,271
Is it a problem?
- No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,555
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,110
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,919
Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,878
...other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,231
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,915
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,669
Yeah!

26
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,391
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

27
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,109
- You and your friends are dead.
- He's out, right?

28
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,274
What...?

29
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,472
Where did you learn to count?

30
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,116
They wired this thing up
with like 5000 volts.

31
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,474
What kind of bank does that?

32
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,552
A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

33
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,709
Where's the alarm guy?

34
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,269
Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

35
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,714
One less share, right?

36
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,750
Funny, he told me something similar.

37
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,319
He what? No! No!

38
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,879
That's a lot of money.

39
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,589
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

40
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,714
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.

41
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,229
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

42
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,989
Bus driver?

43
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,553
What bus driver?

44
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,311
School's out. Time to go.

45
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,630
That guy's not getting up, is he?

46
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,952
That's a lot of money.

47
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,550
What happened to the rest of the guys?

48
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,315
You think you're smart, huh?

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,558
The guy that hired youse...

50
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,548
...he'll just do the same to you.

51
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,673
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

52
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,068
Honor...

53
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,878
...respect.

54
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,270
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

55
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,668
What do you believe in?!

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,710
I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...

57
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,719
...stranger.

58
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,758
<i>Mr. Mayor, you were elected</i>
<i>in a campaign to clean up the city.</i>

59
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,990
<i>- When are you gonna start?</i>
<i>- I already have.</i>

60
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,195
<i>Like this Batman.</i>

61
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,828
<i>We're hearing he's doing good,</i>
<i>criminals are running scared.</i>

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,549
- No, man. I don't like it tonight.
- What are you, superstitious?

63
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,678
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

64
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,071
<i>That's not true. Our men in the</i>
<i>Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.</i>

65
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,073
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.

66
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,276
The investigation is ongoing.

67
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,749
<i>The process of cleaning up</i>
<i>the streets is a long one.</i>

68
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,831
<i>I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...</i>

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,195
Ever intending to see your wife again,
lieutenant?

70
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,920
I thought you had to
go look after your mother, detective.

71
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,957
Checked her back into the hospital.

72
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,958
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,591
- So he hasn't shown up?
- He often doesn't.

74
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,598
I like reminding everybody
he's out there.

75
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,988
Why wouldn't he come?

76
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,072
Hopefully...

77
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,039
...because he's busy.

78
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,878
That's why we bring dogs.

79
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,270
- My little princes.
- Please.

80
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,876
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

81
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,679
Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

82
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,398
Buyer beware.

83
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,632
I told you my compound
would take you places.

84
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,439
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

85
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,034
My business, repeat customers.

86
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,838
You don't like
what I have to offer...

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,672
...you can buy from someone else.

88
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,479
Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.

89
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,514
My dogs are hungry.

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,275
Pity there's only one of you.

91
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,512
What...?
- That's not him.

92
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,392
Loose the dogs!

93
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,079
That's more like it.

94
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,232
Don't let me find you out here again.

95
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,119
- We're trying to help you.
- I don't need help.

96
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,554
Not my diagnosis.

97
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,156
What gives you the right? What's
the difference between you and me?

98
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,073
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

99
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,317
Everybody back now!

100
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,437
He can't resist showing us his face.

101
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,590
What's he hiding under that makeup?

102
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,560
Uh, can we get a minute,
people, please?

103
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,150
Him again. Who are the others?

104
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,833
Another bunch of smalltimers.

105
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,798
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

106
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,155
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.

107
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,788
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

108
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,428
- We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
- Time to move in.

109
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,229
We'd have to hit all banks
simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.

110
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,152
What about this Joker guy?

111
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,153
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

112
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,550
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

113
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,154
- Do you trust him?
- Be hard to keep him out.

114
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,630
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

115
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,233
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

116
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,994
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...

117
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,639
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

118
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,395
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

119
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,438
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

120
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,876
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.

121
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,509
My armor.

122
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,116
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be... I need to be faster.

123
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,840
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

124
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,389
- Did you get mauled by a tiger?
- It was a dog.

125
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,994
- Huh?
- It was a big dog.

126
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,869
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

127
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,871
Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?

128
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,759
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

129
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,592
...when I said I wanted
to inspire people.

130
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,591
I know.

131
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,193
But things have improved.

132
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,755
Look at the new district attorney.

133
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,311
I am, closely.

134
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,311
Need to know if he can be trusted.

135
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,359
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

136
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,315
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.

137
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,190
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

138
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,351
If you ever took one, I might.

139
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,917
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

140
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,072
Batman has no limits.

141
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,152
- Well, you do, sir.
- Well, can't afford to know them.

142
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,709
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

143
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,474
We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

144
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,837
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

145
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,399
Probably.

146
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,552
Sorry I'm late, folks.

147
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,436
- Where were you?
- Worried you'd have to step up?

148
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,478
- Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
- Well, then...

149
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,551
...fair's fair.

150
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,676
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

151
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,831
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

152
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,276
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

153
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,477
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

154
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,758
I don't. I make my own luck.

155
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,079
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

156
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,800
I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor.

157
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,509
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

158
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,159
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

159
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,198
...someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

160
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,190
Is that man in this courtroom today?

161
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,150
- Could you identify him for us, please?
- You win, counselor.

162
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,833
It was me.

163
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,109
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

164
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,829
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

165
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,959
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

166
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,759
Order.
- Permission to treat...

167
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,114
...the witness as hostile?
- Granted.

168
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,269
- Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

169
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,879
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber,
made in China.

170
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,519
If you wanna kill a
public servant, Mr. Maroni...

171
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,796
...I recommend you buy American.

172
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,194
Get him out of here.
- But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

173
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,911
We'll never be able to link the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

174
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,753
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

175
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,912
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

176
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,718
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

177
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,599
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

178
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,909
But, you know...

179
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,277
...if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

180
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,238
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

181
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,951
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

182
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,313
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

183
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,516
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.

184
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,559
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

185
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,750
Lightly irradiated bills.

186
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,395
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

187
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,478
We liaise with various agencies...

188
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,312
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

189
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,916
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

190
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,150
Mm-hm. What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

191
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,629
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

192
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,872
...I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.

193
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,594
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

194
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,035
...but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

195
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,510
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

196
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,274
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

197
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,555
It's bold.

198
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,549
You gonna count me in?

199
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,311
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

200
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,630
I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

201
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,598
...and it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

202
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,479
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at IA...

203
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,834
...I'd be working alone.

204
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,391
I don't get political points
for being an idealist.

205
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,869
I do the best I can with what I have.

206
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,915
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

207
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,832
...without telling me what we're after.

208
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,348
I can give you the names of the banks.

209
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,351
Well, that's a start.

210
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,950
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

211
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,712
Oh, you don't have
to sell me, Dent.

212
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,791
We all know you're Gotham's
white knight.

213
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,310
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

214
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,108
I wouldn't know about that.

215
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,869
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

216
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,158
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

217
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,151
Well, Mr. Lau...

218
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,159
...I speak for the rest of the board...

219
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,518
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

220
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,670
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...

221
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,229
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

222
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,868
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

223
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,235
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

224
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,879
It's done.

225
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,712
The numbers are solid.

226
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,359
Do them again.

227
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,478
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

228
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,638
Another long night?

229
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,633
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

230
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,474
But I'm not convinced.

231
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,155
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

232
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,629
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

233
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,153
...maybe even illegal.

234
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,912
Okay. Cancel the deal.

235
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,315
You already knew.

236
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,434
Just needed a closer look at their books.

237
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,556
Anything else you can trouble me for?

238
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,479
I need a new suit.

239
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,029
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

240
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,192
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

241
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,838
You wanna be able to turn your head.

242
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,991
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

243
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,919
I'll see what I can do.

244
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,357
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

245
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,556
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

246
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,914
- Really?
- Health inspector's...

247
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,274
...not afraid to pull strings.

248
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,556
Rachel. Fancy that.

249
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,109
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

250
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,510
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

251
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,834
- Natascha. Are you the prima...?
- Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

252
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,197
- Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
- Really? So you're into ballet?

253
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,590
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

254
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,515
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

255
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,829
I certainly hope not.

256
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,357
- Let's put a couple tables together.
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.

257
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,432
Oh, they should. I own the place.

258
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,713
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

259
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,757
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out okay.

260
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,433
Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

261
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,033
Is...? Heh-heh.

262
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,679
The Palisades? Sure.

263
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,195
You know, as our new DA,
you might wanna figure out...

264
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,112
...where your jurisdiction ends.

265
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,068
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

266
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,471
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

267
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,790
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

268
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,837
...not a man who thinks
he's above the law.

269
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,115
Who appointed the Batman?

270
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,955
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

271
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,792
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

272
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,632
When their enemies were at the gates...

273
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,349
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

274
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,988
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

275
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,752
Harvey, the last man
that they appointed...

276
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,115
...to protect the republic
was named Caesar...

277
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,556
...and he never gave up his power.
- Okay, fine.

278
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,994
You either die a hero...

279
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,072
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

280
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,596
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

281
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,877
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

282
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,235
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

283
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,035
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

284
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,228
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

285
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,437
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

286
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,679
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

287
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,559
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.

288
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,551
No, you don't understand.

289
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,393
One fundraiser with my pals...

290
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,036
...you'll never need another cent.

291
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,196
What the hell is this?

292
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,472
<i>As you're all aware,</i>
<i>one of our deposits was stolen.</i>

293
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,871
<i>A relatively small amount, 68 million.</i>

294
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,474
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

295
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,190
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

296
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,237
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

297
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,631
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

298
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,189
<i>Thanks to Mr. Maroni's</i>
<i>well-placed sources...</i>

299
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,989
<i>... we know that police have indeed</i>
<i>identified our banks using marked bills...</i>

300
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,549
<i>... and are planning to</i>
<i>seize your funds today.</i>

301
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,554
<i>And since the enthusiastic new DA has</i>
<i>put all my competitors out of business...</i>

302
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,516
<i>...I'm your only option.</i>
<i>- So, what are you proposing?</i>

303
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,195
<i>Moving all deposits to</i>
<i>one secure location, not a bank.</i>

304
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,237
- Where, then?
<i>- No one can know but me.</i>

305
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,599
<i>If the police were to gain leverage</i>
<i>over one of you...</i>

306
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,478
<i>... everyone's money would be at stake.</i>

307
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,676
What stop them getting to you?

308
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,798
<i>I go to Hong Kong,</i>
<i>far from Dent's jurisdiction...</i>

309
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,913
<i>... and the Chinese will not extradite</i>
<i>one of their own.</i>

310
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,638
<i>How soon can you move the money?</i>

311
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,955
<i>I already have.</i>

312
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,754
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

313
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,875
<i>Rest assured, your money is safe.</i>

314
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,550
Oh, hee-hee, aha.
Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha.

315
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,870
And I thought my jokes were bad.

316
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,998
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.

317
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,388
How about a magic trick?

318
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,830
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

319
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,109
Ta-da!

320
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,713
It's...

321
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,075
It's gone.

322
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,670
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

323
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,559
- You ought to know, you bought it.
- Sit.

324
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,512
I want to hear proposition.

325
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,509
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

326
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,278
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

327
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,436
I mean, what happened?

328
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,229
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

329
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,356
You see, a guy like me...

330
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,439
- A freak.
- Damn right.

331
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,592
A guy like me... Look, listen.

332
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,238
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

333
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,994
...group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

334
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,153
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

335
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,872
The Batman.

336
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:35,068
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

337
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,596
Dent, he's just the beginning.

338
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,711
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

339
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,957
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

340
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,588
He'll find him and make him squeal.

341
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,638
I know the squealers when I see them...

342
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,392
...and...

343
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,553
What do you propose?

344
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,029
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

345
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,153
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

346
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,914
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

347
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,788
How much you want?

348
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,391
Uh, half.

349
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,159
You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

350
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,356
No, I'm not.

351
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,156
If we don't deal with this now...

352
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,878
...soon...

353
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,790
...little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

354
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,839
Enough from the clown!

355
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,833
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

356
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,434
Shit!
...this out of proportion.

357
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,989
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

358
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,639
- Yeah.
- I'm putting the word out.

359
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,995
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

360
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,072
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

361
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,788
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

362
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,555
...when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

363
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,517
Here's my card.

364
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,356
Mm-mm.

365
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,075
You're a hard man to reach.

366
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,155
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

367
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,119
If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.

368
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,840
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

369
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,151
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...

370
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,309
My office?

371
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,995
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

372
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,152
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

373
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,677
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

374
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,237
We need Lau back...

375
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,188
...but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

376
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,114
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

377
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,429
I'll get him to sing.

378
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,239
We're going after the Mob's life savings.

379
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,594
Things will get ugly.

380
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,955
I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.

381
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,599
How will you get him back, any...?

382
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,433
He does that.

383
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,956
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

384
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,476
Well, I'm sure that you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

385
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,710
What's wrong with a phone call?

386
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,350
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

387
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,272
Now, for high-altitude jumps...

388
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,113
...you're going to need oxygen
and stabilizers.

389
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,750
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

390
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,388
...jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

391
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,036
What about getting back into the plane?

392
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,875
- I'd recommend a good travel agent.
- Without it landing.

393
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,639
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

394
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,674
The CIA had a program
back in the '60s...

395
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,037
...for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.

396
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,760
- We could look into that.
- Yeah.

397
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,512
Okay. Now...

398
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,554
Hardened Kevlar plates
over titanium-dipped...

399
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,756
...tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

400
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,639
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

401
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,070
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

402
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,151
- Yeah.
- Now, there is a tradeoff.

403
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,676
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

404
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,673
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

405
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,796
How will it hold up against dogs?

406
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,996
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

407
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,549
Should do fine against cats.

408
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,756
I found one in Arizona.

409
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,718
A very nice man said he could have it
up and running in a week...

410
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,915
...and he takes cash.

411
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,799
- What about the flight crew?
- South Korean smugglers.

412
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,076
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

413
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,879
- Did you think of an alibi?
- Oh, yes.

414
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,394
I believe this is your plane, sir.

415
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,796
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

416
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,756
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

417
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,115
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

418
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,032
They brought the body.

419
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,149
So, dead, that's 500.

420
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,758
How about alive? Hm?

421
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,877
You wanna know how I got these scars?

422
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,598
My father was...

423
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,159
...a drinker...

424
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,514
...and a fiend.

425
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,313
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

426
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,393
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

427
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,039
He doesn't like that...

428
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,510
...not one bit.

429
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,114
So, me watching...

430
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,671
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

431
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,798
He turns to me and he says:

432
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,475
"Why so serious?"

433
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,233
He comes at me with the knife.

434
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,711
"Why so serious?"

435
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,633
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

436
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,714
"Let's put a smile on that face."

437
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,996
And...

438
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,759
Why so serious?

439
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,033
Now...

440
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,350
...our operation is small...

441
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,318
...but there is a lot of potential...

442
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,914
...for aggressive expansion.

443
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,152
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

444
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,552
Oh. There's only one spot open
right now, so we're gonna have...

445
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,270
...tryouts.

446
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,591
Make it fast.

447
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,993
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

448
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,754
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

449
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,751
I understand.

450
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,596
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

451
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,273
Of course.

452
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,469
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

453
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,030
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

454
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,634
...I couldn't let it threaten my company.
- Of course.

455
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,837
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

456
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,788
...with you here now, we can continue.

457
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,555
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...

458
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,792
We do not allow cell phones in here.

459
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,554
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

460
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,157
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

461
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,638
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

462
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,597
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

463
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,228
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

464
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,154
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

465
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,551
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

466
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,278
Just accidentally wasting it.

467
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,233
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

468
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,274
Hey, sir.

469
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,671
There's a better view
from the peak tram.

470
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,592
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

471
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,359
Restricted.

472
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,431
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

473
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,431
- What's this?
- I had R & D work it up.

474
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,192
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

475
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,079
...records the response time
for mapping an environment.

476
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,028
Sonar. Just like a...

477
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,270
Submarine, Mr. Wayne.
Like a submarine.

478
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,512
- And the other device?
- It's in place.

479
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,389
Mr. Wayne?

480
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,788
Good luck.

481
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,397
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

482
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,711
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

483
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,839
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

484
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,638
- Are you threatening my client?
- No.

485
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,839
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

486
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,992
As will everyone.

487
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,477
No? Okay.

488
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,798
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

489
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,393
Wait!

490
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,511
I won't give you the money...

491
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,558
...but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

492
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,956
You were a glorified accountant.

493
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,795
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

494
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,635
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

495
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,313
One big pot.

496
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,914
Got it.

497
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,072
One minute.

498
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,434
RICO. If they pooled their money...

499
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,318
...we can charge them
as one criminal conspiracy.

500
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,595
Charge them with what?

501
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,513
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of them with a felony...

502
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,148
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

503
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,311
Mr. Lau.

504
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,114
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

505
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,838
- Ledgers...?
- Immunity, protection...

506
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,310
...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
- After you testify in open court.

507
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,710
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

508
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,156
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

509
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,312
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

510
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,951
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

511
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,554
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

512
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,400
Well, you trust them over at County?

513
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,312
I don't trust them here.

514
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,433
Lau stays.

515
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,348
<i>Well, I don't know about</i>
<i>Mr. Lau's travel arrangements...</i>

516
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,238
<i>... but I'm sure glad he's back.</i>

517
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,755
Put word out. We hire the clown.

518
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,115
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

519
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,669
Batman.

520
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,794
<i>- I'm not aware of any participation...</i>
- Our boy looks good on the tube.

521
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,919
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

522
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,595
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

523
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,912
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

524
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,832
<i>Seven hundred</i>
<i>twelve counts of extortion.</i>

525
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,309
<i>Eight hundred and forty-nine</i>
<i>counts of racketeering.</i>

526
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,914
Two hundred and forty-six
counts of fraud.

527
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,799
Eighty-seven counts
of conspiracy murder.

528
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,672
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

529
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,399
How do the defendants plead?

530
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,269
Order in the court.

531
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,829
<i>Five hundred and forty-nine</i>
<i>criminals at once.</i>

532
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,389
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

533
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,519
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

534
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,592
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

535
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,228
...you're gonna set
a new record at appeals.

536
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,789
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

537
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,269
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

538
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,192
They can't afford to be off the streets.

539
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,396
They'll cut deals that
include some jail time.

540
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,438
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.

541
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,912
Mr. Mayor, you can't...
- No, get out. Both of you.

542
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,399
Sit down.

543
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,038
The public likes you. That's the
only reason that this might fly.

544
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,474
But that means it's on you.

545
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,552
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

546
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,395
Politicians, journalists, cops.

547
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,949
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.

548
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,680
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

549
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,876
Because they get anything on you...

550
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,636
...and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.

551
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,028
Jesus!

552
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,675
I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

553
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,400
And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

554
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,518
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

555
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,636
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

556
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,518
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

557
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,593
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

558
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,513
<i>Police released video</i>
<i>footage found concealed on the body.</i>

559
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,194
<i>Sensitive viewers, be aware.</i>
<i>The image is disturbing.</i>

560
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,476
<i>Tell them your name.</i>

561
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,232
<i>Brian Douglas.</i>

562
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,990
<i>And are you the real Batman?</i>

563
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,149
<i>No.</i>
<i>- No?</i>

564
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,197
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- No?</i>

565
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,998
<i>Then why do you dress up like him?</i>

566
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,469
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

567
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,553
<i>Because he's a symbol that we</i>
<i>don't have to be afraid of scum like you.</i>

568
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,917
<i>Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.</i>

569
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,550
<i>Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh.</i>

570
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,998
<i>So you think Batman's</i>
<i>made Gotham a better place? Hm?</i>

571
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,679
<i>Look at me.</i>

572
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,035
<i>Look at me!</i>

573
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,996
<i>You see, this is how crazy</i>
<i>Batman's made Gotham.</i>

574
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,355
<i>You want order in Gotham...</i>

575
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,912
<i>... Batman must take off his mask</i>
<i>and turn himself in.</i>

576
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,709
<i>Oh, and every day he doesn't,</i>
<i>people will die.</i>

577
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,076
<i>Starting tonight.</i>

578
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,596
<i>I'm a man of my word.</i>

579
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,879
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

580
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,998
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

581
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,354
- I'll be back.
- Rachel.

582
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,239
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

583
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,709
- Thank you. Alfred, right?
- That's right, sir.

584
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,031
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.

585
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,394
Not yet, sir.

586
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,750
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

587
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,070
Oh, you have no idea.

588
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,593
I'm sorry that I'm late.

589
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,035
I'm glad to see
that you all got started without me.

590
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,749
Now, where is Harvey? Where...?

591
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,229
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

592
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,674
Where's Rachel Dawes?

593
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,115
She is my oldest friend. Come here.

594
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,669
When Rachel first told me she
was dating Harvey Dent...

595
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,989
...I had one thing to say:

596
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,509
"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"

597
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,355
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

598
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,431
But it caught Rachel's attention.

599
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,478
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

600
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,031
...and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

601
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,918
And you know what?

602
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,313
I believe in Harvey Dent.

603
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,916
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

604
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,595
...a little safer, a little more optimistic.

605
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,112
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

606
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,350
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

607
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,199
Harvey.

608
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,719
Harvey may not know you
well enough...

609
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,757
...to understand you're
making fun of him...

610
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,831
...but I do.
- No, I meant every word.

611
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,918
You know that day
that you once told me about...

612
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,071
...when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?

613
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,071
- It's coming.
- Bruce.

614
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,238
- You can't ask me to wait for that.
- It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

615
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,678
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

616
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,956
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

617
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,955
You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

618
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,111
Thanks again.

619
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,518
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

620
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,115
Lieutenant, that joker card
pinned to the body?

621
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,952
Forensics found three sets of DNA.

622
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,473
- Any matches?
- All three.

623
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,996
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

624
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,071
The Joker's telling us
who he's targeting.

625
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,993
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

626
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,116
Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

627
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,713
- City hall.
- Seal the building.

628
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,791
- No one in or out till I get there.
- Got it.

629
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,875
Gordon. What are you up to?

630
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,157
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.

631
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,788
We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

632
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,313
These are dangerous people.

633
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,152
You're not giving me
a lot of information.

634
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,197
Even we don't know
where you're going.

635
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,557
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

636
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,071
You can't leave me alone
with these people.

637
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,152
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

638
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,197
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

639
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,796
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

640
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,873
...take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

641
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,353
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

642
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,710
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

643
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,154
Yeah, I bet.

644
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,438
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

645
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,511
...about who you wanna
spend your life with.

646
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,558
- That's a pretty big commitment.
- Not if the Mob has their way.

647
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,154
You get to explain to my wife...

648
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,553
...why I'm late for dinner.

649
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,757
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

650
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,794
- Don't do that.
- All right.

651
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,118
- Let's be serious, then.
- Okay.

652
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,429
What's your answer?

653
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,793
I don't have an answer.

654
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,869
How'd they get my DNA?

655
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,110
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

656
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,794
...must have lifted a tissue
or a glass... Wait! Wait!

657
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,758
- Well, I guess no answer is a no.
- Harvey.

658
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,956
- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey.

659
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,157
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f...

660
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,039
What are you doing?

661
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,749
Oh, shit.

662
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,352
Get a medic!

663
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,709
They've come for him.

664
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,275
We made it.

665
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,749
Stay hidden.

666
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,117
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

667
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,674
We are tonight's entertainment.

668
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,710
I only have one question:

669
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,310
Where is Harvey Dent?

670
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,391
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

671
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,788
Hands up, pretty boy.

672
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,313
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

673
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,199
Just something little, huh? No.

674
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,039
What's going on out there? Wayne!

675
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,759
Oh, thank God, you've
got a panic room.

676
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,035
Hey, wait...

677
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,318
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

678
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,511
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

679
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,036
We're not intimidated by thugs.

680
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,598
You know...

681
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,038
...you remind me of my father.

682
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,232
I hated my father.

683
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,356
Okay, stop.

684
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,759
Well, hello, beautiful.

685
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,515
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

686
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,269
And you are beautiful.

687
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,629
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

688
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,636
You wanna know how I got them?

689
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,234
Come here. Hey.

690
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,238
Look at me.

691
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,231
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

692
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,519
...who tells me I worry too much...

693
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,478
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

694
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,919
...who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

695
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,629
One day they carve her face.

696
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,193
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

697
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,916
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?

698
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,038
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

699
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,039
So...

700
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,115
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

701
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,879
...to myself.

702
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,029
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

703
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,679
She leaves.

704
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,669
Now I see the funny side.

705
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,033
Now I'm always smiling.

706
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,517
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

707
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,954
Then you're gonna love me.

708
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,109
Drop the gun.

709
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,794
Oh, sure. You just take off
your little mask...

710
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,076
...and show us all who
you really are. Hm?

711
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,629
Let her go.

712
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,753
Very poor choice of words.

713
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,437
Are you all right?

714
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,875
Let's not do that again.

715
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,549
- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.

716
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,314
Thank you.

717
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,629
Jim, it's over.

718
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,268
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

719
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,873
The prosecution's over.

720
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,632
Nobody's standing up
in front of a judge...

721
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,678
...while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

722
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,558
- What about Dent?
- He's got any sense...

723
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,755
...Dent's halfway to Mex...

724
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,433
So where do you keep your trash?

725
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,508
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

726
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,592
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

727
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,957
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

728
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,475
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

729
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,273
Targeting me won't get their money.

730
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,192
I knew the Mob wouldn't go
down easily...

731
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,351
...but this is different.
They crossed a line.

732
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,714
You crossed the line first.

733
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,156
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

734
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:53,110
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

735
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,034
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

736
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,316
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

737
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,833
With respect, Master Wayne...

738
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,833
...perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

739
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,194
A long time ago, I was in Burma...

740
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,636
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

741
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,268
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

742
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,159
...by bribing them with
precious stones...

743
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:19,711
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

744
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,031
So we went looking for the stones.

745
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,315
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

746
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,754
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

747
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,832
...the size of a tangerine.

748
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,311
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

749
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,554
- So why steal them?
- Because he thought it was good sport.

750
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,475
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

751
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,713
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

752
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,795
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

753
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,515
<i>Your name, sir?</i>

754
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,717
<i>Eighth and Orchard.</i>
<i>You'll find Harvey Dent there.</i>

755
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,479
Check the names.

756
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,438
"Richard Dent."

757
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,595
"Patrick Harvey."

758
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,869
Harvey Dent.

759
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,918
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

760
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,236
It's because of you
these guys are dead...

761
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,879
Detective!

762
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,956
Give us a minute, guys.

763
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,633
That's brick underneath.

764
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,552
Gonna take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

765
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,278
No.

766
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,511
Fingerprints.

767
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,551
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

768
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,796
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

769
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,595
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.

770
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,196
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

771
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,989
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

772
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,835
Well, I found some irregularities.

773
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,231
Their CEO is in police custody.

774
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,198
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

775
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,358
Applied Sciences. Whole division
of Wayne Enterprises...

776
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,112
...just disappeared overnight.

777
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,353
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

778
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,237
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby...

779
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,870
...pancaking cop cars
on the evening news.

780
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,232
Now you got the entire R & D
Department burning through cash...

781
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,597
...claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

782
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,718
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

783
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,192
I want...

784
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,114
...$ 10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

785
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,556
Let me get this straight.

786
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,075
You think that your client...

787
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,198
One of the wealthiest,
most powerful men in the world...

788
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,873
...is secretly a vigilante...

789
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,511
...who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare hands...

790
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,717
...and your plan
is to blackmail this person?

791
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,108
Good luck.

792
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,233
When...

793
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,999
Keep that.

794
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,755
This is your original scan.

795
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,315
Here it is reengineered.

796
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,590
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

797
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,635
I'll get you a copy.

798
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,469
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D?

799
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,029
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

800
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,156
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

801
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,278
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

802
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,998
Fair enough.

803
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,199
With no word
from the Batman...

804
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,793
...even as they mourn
Commissioner Loeb...

805
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,191
...these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

806
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,432
...in the obituary column of
<i>The Gotham Times</i> to kill the mayor.

807
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,675
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

808
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,876
Cross-reference the addresses.

809
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,874
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

810
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,109
I got one.

811
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,114
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

812
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,393
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

813
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,393
What do you got on the roof?

814
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,950
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

815
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:27,039
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

816
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,395
...and to the protection
of his community.

817
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,278
I remember when I first took office...

818
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,874
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

819
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:39,068
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

820
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,717
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

821
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,196
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

822
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,477
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

823
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,272
- Who's that?
- What happened?

824
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,077
They took our guns.

825
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,958
And our uniforms.

826
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,919
And as we recognize
the sacrifice of this man...

827
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,868
...we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

828
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,429
Stand by. Honor guard.

829
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,070
Attention. Port arms.

830
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,438
Ready! Aim! Fire!

831
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,679
Ready! Aim!

832
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,435
Ready! Aim!

833
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,873
Stay down! Don't move!

834
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,232
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

835
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,230
- I'll see you later.
- Why are you going back?

836
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,349
Get out of here.

837
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,912
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

838
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,954
No.

839
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,634
I'm sorry, Barbara.

840
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,637
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

841
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,950
If there's anything
we can do, anything you need...

842
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,792
...we're here for you.

843
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,151
Shh.

844
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,514
Are you out there?

845
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:10,112
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

846
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,555
You brought this on us!

847
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,951
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

848
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,238
God help whoever
he does wanna talk to.

849
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,638
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

850
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,519
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

851
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,669
What?

852
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,438
- Yeah?
- Second.

853
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,589
Okay.

854
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,830
- Harvey, where are you?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

855
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,036
I'm where you should be,
at Major Crimes.

856
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,679
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

857
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,276
- Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
<i>- Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.</i>

858
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,158
- This is Gordon's unit.
<i>- Gordon's gone.</i>

859
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:15,756
He vouched for these men.
<i>- And he's gone.</i>

860
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,191
<i>The Joker's named you next.</i>

861
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,238
<i>God, is there someone, is there anyone</i>
<i>in this town we can trust?</i>

862
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,038
Bruce.

863
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,435
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

864
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,113
<i>No. Rachel, I know</i>
<i>you're his friend, but...</i>

865
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,032
Harvey, trust me.

866
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,839
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

867
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,274
<i>Then you go straight there.</i>

868
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,476
<i>Don't tell anybody</i>
<i>and I'll find you there.</i>

869
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,278
I love you.

870
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,914
I want the Joker.

871
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,672
From one professional to another...

872
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,274
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

873
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,908
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

874
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,593
- I'm counting on it.
- Huh!

875
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,672
- Where is he?
- I don't know where he is. He found us.

876
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,068
He must have friends.

877
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,595
Friends? Have you met this guy?

878
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,273
Someone knows where he is.

879
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,829
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

880
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,274
They're wise to your act.

881
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:28,274
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

882
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:33,116
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

883
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,998
But you already know what that is.

884
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,833
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

885
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,313
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

886
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,831
You wanna play games?

887
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:53,869
How's that feel?

888
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,554
- You wouldn't.
- I wouldn't!

889
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,558
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

890
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,676
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

891
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,072
No. No, I wouldn't.

892
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,674
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

893
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,518
Heads, you get to keep your head.

894
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,478
Tails...

895
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,389
...not so lucky.

896
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,150
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

897
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,709
- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything! God, don't!

898
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,155
You're not playing the odds, friend.

899
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,151
Let's do it again.

900
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,632
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

901
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,796
- Not exactly.
- His name's Schiff, Thomas.

902
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,838
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

903
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,437
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

904
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,313
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

905
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,153
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

906
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,072
Your stand against organized crime...

907
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,312
...is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

908
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,950
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

909
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,315
The criminals you arrested
would be released...

910
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,438
...and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

911
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,190
You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

912
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,635
- Why?
- No one else will die because of me.

913
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,030
Gotham's in your hands now.

914
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,838
You can't.

915
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,319
You can't give in.

916
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,034
You can't give in!

917
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,954
Harvey called.

918
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:51,032
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

919
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,269
I have no choice.

920
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,398
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

921
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,870
Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

922
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:03,950
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

923
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,790
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

924
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,951
...that we'd be together.

925
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,677
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

926
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,434
Did you mean it?

927
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,632
Yes.

928
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,918
Bruce.

929
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,594
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

930
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,633
Logs as well?
- Everything.

931
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:59,031
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

932
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,311
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

933
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,075
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

934
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,789
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

935
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:20,273
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

936
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,714
The right choice.

937
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,112
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

938
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,474
He can't endure this.

939
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,513
Today you get to say "I told you so."

940
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,117
Today, I don't want to.

941
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,119
But I did bloody tell you.

942
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,918
I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

943
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,874
...as your accomplice.

944
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:52,591
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

945
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:00,070
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

946
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,196
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

947
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,875
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

948
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,158
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

949
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,958
<i>But let's consider the situation.</i>

950
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,834
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

951
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,399
Do we really think he's gonna...?

952
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,791
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

953
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,235
The Batman is an outlaw.

954
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,911
That's not why we demand
he turn himself in...

955
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,672
...we're doing it because we're scared.

956
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,513
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

957
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,513
Things are worse than ever!
- Amen.

958
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,631
Yes, they are.

959
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,918
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

960
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,271
And I promise you...

961
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,393
...the dawn is coming.

962
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,917
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

963
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,752
...not to this madman.

964
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,150
- No more dead cops!
- Yeah!

965
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,833
He should turn himself in!

966
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,594
Give us the Batman! Come on!
- Where is he?

967
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,430
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

968
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,757
What?
- Is he here?

969
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,429
I am the Batman.

970
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,638
What?
- Come on.

971
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,511
Alfred.

972
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,518
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

973
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,558
- He went down to the press conference.
- I know. He just stood by.

974
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,711
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

975
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,758
...believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

976
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,150
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

977
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,231
...even if everyone hates him for it.

978
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,436
That's the sacrifice he's making.

979
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,070
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

980
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,158
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

981
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:52,278
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

982
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,398
You know him better than anyone.

983
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,789
I do.

984
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,952
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

985
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,509
How will I know?

986
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,113
It's not sealed.

987
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,959
Goodbye, Alfred.

988
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,632
Bye, Rachel.

989
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,952
I didn't have time to talk this through.

990
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,314
What are you doing?

991
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,471
They're transferring me
to Central Holding.

992
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,275
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

993
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,919
Listen. This is too dangerous.

994
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,629
We get this guy to County, he's their
problem. The streets will be cleared...

995
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,349
...so let's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.

996
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,919
I hope you got some moves, pal.

997
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,878
He's using you as bait. He doesn't
know if he can get the Joker.

998
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,075
He's failed so far.

999
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,879
How do you know
what he's thinking?

1000
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,270
I just do. Anyway,
this isn't just about you.

1001
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,192
What about the people
depending on you...

1002
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,238
...to clean the city up
and do it honorably and...?

1003
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:05,194
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

1004
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,357
Heads, I go through with it.

1005
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,391
This is your life. You can't leave...

1006
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,835
...something like that to chance.
- I'm not.

1007
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,309
You make your own luck.

1008
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,151
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

1009
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,710
What the hell is that?

1010
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,996
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

1011
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,232
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

1012
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:57,709
<i>Exit down!</i>

1013
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,110
Lower Fifth? We'll be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving.

1014
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,710
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

1015
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,075
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

1016
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,719
We got trouble, guys.

1017
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,555
Lock and load!

1018
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,639
The hell was that?

1019
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,160
- These are built for that, right?
- He'll need something...

1020
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,038
...a lot bigger to get through this.

1021
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,439
What is that?

1022
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,994
What is that, a bazooka?

1023
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,918
I didn't sign up for this!

1024
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,874
Look out.

1025
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,755
Look out!

1026
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,709
Hmm.

1027
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,189
Come on, let's go!

1028
01:15:01,941 --> 01:15:04,057
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

1029
01:15:04,221 --> 01:15:06,940
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

1030
01:15:11,661 --> 01:15:15,097
<i>Scanning all systems.</i>
<i>Scanning all systems.</i>

1031
01:15:22,261 --> 01:15:24,297
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

1032
01:15:29,581 --> 01:15:31,378
I like this job. I like it.

1033
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:36,055
<i>Damage catastrophic.</i>
<i>Eject sequence initiated.</i>

1034
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:50,894
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1035
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:02,693
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

1036
01:16:08,821 --> 01:16:11,176
That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.

1037
01:16:24,181 --> 01:16:25,819
Okay, rack them up.

1038
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,256
<i>Rack them up, rack them up,</i>
<i>rack them up.</i>

1039
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,056
That's not good.

1040
01:16:57,421 --> 01:16:58,570
Okay, that's not good!

1041
01:17:39,941 --> 01:17:41,932
Now, there's a Batman.

1042
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:47,210
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

1043
01:17:50,021 --> 01:17:51,090
Come on.

1044
01:17:59,861 --> 01:18:01,055
He missed!

1045
01:18:14,421 --> 01:18:16,730
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

1046
01:18:33,061 --> 01:18:34,096
Come on, come on.

1047
01:18:37,101 --> 01:18:40,332
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

1048
01:18:42,781 --> 01:18:44,180
Come on.

1049
01:18:44,821 --> 01:18:48,018
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

1050
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:49,739
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1051
01:18:51,781 --> 01:18:52,770
Hit me!

1052
01:19:16,741 --> 01:19:19,858
Come on, come on. Aah!

1053
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,171
Could you please just give me a minute?

1054
01:19:24,181 --> 01:19:25,933
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1055
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:32,855
Gor... You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1056
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:34,939
We got him, Harvey.

1057
01:19:35,101 --> 01:19:38,411
Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1058
01:19:38,581 --> 01:19:41,732
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1059
01:19:41,901 --> 01:19:43,175
But you and your office...

1060
01:19:43,341 --> 01:19:44,933
...have been working
with the Batman all along.

1061
01:19:45,101 --> 01:19:46,819
No, but I trusted him
to do the right thing.

1062
01:19:46,981 --> 01:19:48,972
Which was?
- Saving my ass.

1063
01:19:49,141 --> 01:19:51,939
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1064
01:19:52,101 --> 01:19:53,932
Thank you, detective.

1065
01:19:54,141 --> 01:19:56,177
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1066
01:19:56,341 --> 01:19:58,616
- I figured, counselor.
- Mr. Dent, sir...

1067
01:19:58,781 --> 01:20:02,740
...how about one for the front page, sir?
- Mr. Dent.

1068
01:20:13,621 --> 01:20:16,658
Stand away! All of you!

1069
01:20:16,821 --> 01:20:20,177
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

1070
01:20:22,341 --> 01:20:24,138
Back from the dead.

1071
01:20:24,781 --> 01:20:26,260
I, uh...

1072
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:28,252
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1073
01:20:29,501 --> 01:20:31,253
What do we got?

1074
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:36,649
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.

1075
01:20:36,821 --> 01:20:39,460
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1076
01:20:39,661 --> 01:20:41,697
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1077
01:20:41,861 --> 01:20:43,692
No name.

1078
01:20:44,021 --> 01:20:45,898
- No other alias.
- Go home, Gordon.

1079
01:20:46,061 --> 01:20:49,019
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1080
01:20:49,181 --> 01:20:50,933
You're gonna need it.

1081
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:53,649
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1082
01:20:54,301 --> 01:20:57,338
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1083
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:14,577
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1084
01:21:20,821 --> 01:21:22,174
Look at these ugly bastards.

1085
01:21:22,341 --> 01:21:24,138
- I don't feel good.
- You're a cop killer.

1086
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:26,531
You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.

1087
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:28,214
- Please!
- Step away from the bars!

1088
01:21:28,381 --> 01:21:30,451
My insides hurt.

1089
01:21:44,061 --> 01:21:45,779
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1090
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:50,056
Actually, this time...

1091
01:21:50,221 --> 01:21:52,291
...I saved him.

1092
01:22:03,181 --> 01:22:04,739
Has he said anything yet?

1093
01:22:12,021 --> 01:22:16,060
Evening, commissioner.

1094
01:22:23,381 --> 01:22:25,497
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1095
01:22:25,661 --> 01:22:27,697
- Of course not.
- What have you done with him?

1096
01:22:28,581 --> 01:22:30,253
Me?

1097
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:33,857
I was right here.

1098
01:22:35,221 --> 01:22:36,973
Who did you leave him with?

1099
01:22:37,141 --> 01:22:39,860
Hm? Your people?

1100
01:22:40,941 --> 01:22:44,138
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1101
01:22:44,301 --> 01:22:46,895
...and not Maroni's.

1102
01:22:49,021 --> 01:22:51,296
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1103
01:22:51,701 --> 01:22:56,456
...to know just how alone you really are?

1104
01:22:58,381 --> 01:23:03,057
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1105
01:23:03,221 --> 01:23:05,781
- Where is he?
- What's the time?

1106
01:23:06,261 --> 01:23:07,694
What difference does that make?

1107
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:13,174
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1108
01:23:19,301 --> 01:23:22,134
- If we're gonna play games...
- Mm-hm?

1109
01:23:25,181 --> 01:23:27,058
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1110
01:23:27,221 --> 01:23:31,134
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1111
01:23:31,781 --> 01:23:32,770
Not exactly.

1112
01:23:42,861 --> 01:23:46,740
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next...

1113
01:23:49,781 --> 01:23:50,850
See?

1114
01:23:51,021 --> 01:23:53,251
You wanted me. Here I am.

1115
01:23:54,261 --> 01:23:56,297
<i>I wanted to see what you'd do.</i>

1116
01:23:56,821 --> 01:23:59,289
And you didn't disappoint.

1117
01:23:59,461 --> 01:24:02,180
You let five people die.

1118
01:24:03,101 --> 01:24:06,616
Then you let Dent take your place.

1119
01:24:06,781 --> 01:24:09,295
- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
- Where's Dent?

1120
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:14,057
Those Mob fools want you gone so they
can get back to the way things were.

1121
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:19,092
But I know the truth. There's no
going back. You've changed things.

1122
01:24:19,261 --> 01:24:21,570
- Forever.
- Then why do you wanna kill me?

1123
01:24:24,421 --> 01:24:25,774
I don't wanna kill you.

1124
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:30,618
What would I do without you? Go back
to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1125
01:24:30,781 --> 01:24:33,056
No. No, you...

1126
01:24:33,221 --> 01:24:35,530
You complete me.

1127
01:24:35,701 --> 01:24:39,853
- You're garbage who kills for money.
- Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1128
01:24:40,021 --> 01:24:42,330
Even if you'd like to be.

1129
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:45,293
To them, you're just a freak...

1130
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,455
...like me.

1131
01:24:47,621 --> 01:24:49,816
They need you right now...

1132
01:24:50,381 --> 01:24:52,337
...but when they don't...

1133
01:24:52,861 --> 01:24:55,773
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1134
01:24:55,941 --> 01:24:59,695
You see, their morals, their code...

1135
01:24:59,941 --> 01:25:02,011
...it's a bad joke.

1136
01:25:02,261 --> 01:25:05,458
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1137
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:09,935
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1138
01:25:10,101 --> 01:25:13,138
When the chips are down, these...

1139
01:25:13,301 --> 01:25:15,451
These civilized people...

1140
01:25:15,621 --> 01:25:17,612
...they'll eat each other.

1141
01:25:18,301 --> 01:25:20,576
See, I'm not a monster.

1142
01:25:21,901 --> 01:25:23,129
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1143
01:25:25,301 --> 01:25:26,336
Where's Dent?

1144
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:29,299
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1145
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:34,570
- He's in control.
- I have one rule.

1146
01:25:34,741 --> 01:25:37,699
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have
to break to know the truth.

1147
01:25:37,861 --> 01:25:38,976
Which is?

1148
01:25:39,141 --> 01:25:41,450
The only sensible way to live
is without rules.

1149
01:25:41,621 --> 01:25:44,181
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

1150
01:25:44,341 --> 01:25:45,330
I'm considering it.

1151
01:25:45,501 --> 01:25:48,015
There's only minutes left,
so you'll have to play my game...

1152
01:25:48,181 --> 01:25:50,649
...if you wanna save one of them.

1153
01:25:51,141 --> 01:25:52,130
"Them"?

1154
01:25:52,301 --> 01:25:56,180
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1155
01:25:56,341 --> 01:25:58,855
The way you threw yourself after her.

1156
01:26:04,901 --> 01:26:05,936
Look at you go.

1157
01:26:11,341 --> 01:26:14,777
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?

1158
01:26:15,661 --> 01:26:16,980
Where are they?!

1159
01:26:17,141 --> 01:26:19,052
Killing is making a choice.

1160
01:26:19,221 --> 01:26:22,179
- Where are they?!
- Choose between one life or the other.

1161
01:26:22,901 --> 01:26:26,974
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1162
01:26:31,941 --> 01:26:35,854
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1163
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:39,617
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1164
01:26:39,821 --> 01:26:43,097
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1165
01:26:43,261 --> 01:26:46,173
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1166
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:49,620
He's at 25052nd Street...

1167
01:26:49,781 --> 01:26:52,978
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1168
01:26:54,981 --> 01:26:56,653
- Which one you going after?
- Rachel.

1169
01:26:58,021 --> 01:26:59,374
We're getting Dent!

1170
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:04,260
25052nd Street!

1171
01:27:07,061 --> 01:27:08,813
<i>Hello?</i>

1172
01:27:09,741 --> 01:27:12,016
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

1173
01:27:14,341 --> 01:27:16,855
<i>Hello!</i>

1174
01:27:20,701 --> 01:27:22,851
- Rachel?
- Harvey.

1175
01:27:23,021 --> 01:27:25,137
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1176
01:27:25,301 --> 01:27:26,814
I'm all right. I'm in a...

1177
01:27:26,981 --> 01:27:30,417
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1178
01:27:31,421 --> 01:27:32,570
I am too.

1179
01:27:33,101 --> 01:27:34,739
<i>Harvey.</i>

1180
01:27:41,701 --> 01:27:44,056
I want my phone call.

1181
01:27:44,221 --> 01:27:46,894
I want it. I want it.
I want my phone call.

1182
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:49,293
That's nice.

1183
01:27:50,741 --> 01:27:55,371
How many of your friends have I killed?

1184
01:27:58,981 --> 01:28:00,016
I'm a 20-year man...

1185
01:28:00,181 --> 01:28:03,491
...and I know the difference between
punks who need a lesson in manners...

1186
01:28:03,661 --> 01:28:06,414
...and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1187
01:28:07,261 --> 01:28:09,616
And you killed six of my friends.

1188
01:28:09,781 --> 01:28:10,770
<i>Six?</i>

1189
01:28:10,941 --> 01:28:13,296
Please. My insides hurt.

1190
01:28:13,461 --> 01:28:15,133
I don't really care. Back away.

1191
01:28:15,301 --> 01:28:18,338
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1192
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:21,891
He said he'd go inside
and replace them with bright lights...

1193
01:28:22,061 --> 01:28:23,130
...like Christmas.

1194
01:28:23,301 --> 01:28:25,735
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1195
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:28,620
Medic to the holding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1196
01:28:28,821 --> 01:28:29,936
You guys, back off!

1197
01:28:30,101 --> 01:28:32,171
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1198
01:28:32,341 --> 01:28:36,175
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1199
01:28:36,341 --> 01:28:39,538
...and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1200
01:28:42,141 --> 01:28:44,177
Okay, Rachel.

1201
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:47,733
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.
They're coming for you.

1202
01:28:47,901 --> 01:28:52,019
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.

1203
01:28:52,181 --> 01:28:54,012
<i>Can you find something,</i>
<i>anything, sharp?</i>

1204
01:28:54,181 --> 01:28:55,534
I'm trying.

1205
01:28:55,701 --> 01:28:57,771
- What's...?
<i>- Shit.</i>

1206
01:28:57,941 --> 01:28:59,374
Harvey?

1207
01:29:02,981 --> 01:29:04,573
Harvey, what's happening?

1208
01:29:13,541 --> 01:29:17,216
All available units,
converge at 25052nd Street.

1209
01:29:17,541 --> 01:29:21,454
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1210
01:29:23,661 --> 01:29:24,935
Guns are too quick.

1211
01:29:25,101 --> 01:29:28,332
You can't savor all the...

1212
01:29:28,501 --> 01:29:31,698
...little emotions.

1213
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:38,217
You see, in their last moments...

1214
01:29:38,381 --> 01:29:40,576
...people show you who they really are.

1215
01:29:41,621 --> 01:29:47,059
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1216
01:29:50,661 --> 01:29:53,937
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1217
01:30:00,181 --> 01:30:01,773
What's that?
- Jeez.

1218
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:03,937
He's got some kind of a...

1219
01:30:04,101 --> 01:30:07,173
...contusion.
- I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1220
01:30:08,501 --> 01:30:12,096
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1221
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:18,329
Whoa, whoa!

1222
01:30:19,341 --> 01:30:20,330
Just put it down.

1223
01:30:20,501 --> 01:30:23,174
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1224
01:30:23,341 --> 01:30:27,129
- It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
- Let him go now! Drop it!

1225
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:30,299
- What? Sorry?
- What do you want?

1226
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:33,132
I just want my phone call.

1227
01:30:36,021 --> 01:30:38,581
<i>What...? What...? What's happening?</i>

1228
01:30:38,741 --> 01:30:41,460
<i>Just talk to me, just for one second.</i>

1229
01:30:43,701 --> 01:30:46,261
- All right?
- Right.

1230
01:30:48,101 --> 01:30:49,454
Ow.

1231
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:51,854
- Ow.
- Shh, shh, shh.

1232
01:30:57,581 --> 01:30:59,537
Is that a phone?

1233
01:31:08,821 --> 01:31:10,095
Mount the curb!

1234
01:31:17,781 --> 01:31:21,615
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1235
01:31:21,781 --> 01:31:23,499
<i>Don't think like that. They're coming.</i>

1236
01:31:23,661 --> 01:31:25,856
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1237
01:31:30,101 --> 01:31:34,014
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1238
01:31:34,421 --> 01:31:36,093
My answer is yes.

1239
01:31:38,741 --> 01:31:41,380
No! No! No!

1240
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:44,055
<i>Not me! Why are you coming for me?</i>

1241
01:31:44,221 --> 01:31:45,210
<i>No!</i>

1242
01:31:46,821 --> 01:31:48,334
Rachel! Rachel!

1243
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:50,771
- Harvey.
<i>- No! No! Rachel!</i>

1244
01:31:50,941 --> 01:31:51,930
Okay.

1245
01:31:52,101 --> 01:31:53,136
Rachel!

1246
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:55,020
<i>No! No!</i>

1247
01:31:55,181 --> 01:31:59,140
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1248
01:31:59,301 --> 01:32:00,575
Somewh...

1249
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:07,370
No, commissioner!

1250
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:10,101
Rachel! No!

1251
01:32:23,861 --> 01:32:24,930
Hello there.

1252
01:32:30,581 --> 01:32:33,937
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1253
01:32:34,821 --> 01:32:36,459
With Lau?

1254
01:32:39,141 --> 01:32:41,609
The Joker planned to be caught.

1255
01:32:41,941 --> 01:32:44,011
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.

1256
01:33:06,501 --> 01:33:08,935
<i>I need to be honest and clear.</i>

1257
01:33:10,901 --> 01:33:13,335
<i>I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.</i>

1258
01:33:13,501 --> 01:33:17,255
<i>I love him, and I wanna spend</i>
<i>the rest of my life with him.</i>

1259
01:33:17,781 --> 01:33:22,013
<i>When I told you that if Gotham no longer</i>
<i>needed Batman, we could be together...</i>

1260
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:24,297
<i>... I meant it.</i>

1261
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:29,092
<i>But now I'm sure the day won't come</i>
<i>when you no longer need Batman.</i>

1262
01:33:30,101 --> 01:33:31,932
<i>I hope it does.</i>

1263
01:33:32,101 --> 01:33:34,740
<i>And if it does, I will be there...</i>

1264
01:33:35,261 --> 01:33:36,614
<i>... but as your friend.</i>

1265
01:33:37,301 --> 01:33:39,451
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1266
01:33:39,621 --> 01:33:41,896
<i>I'm sorry to let you down.</i>

1267
01:33:42,061 --> 01:33:46,851
<i>If you lose your faith in me,</i>
<i>please keep your faith in people.</i>

1268
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:51,653
<i>Love, now and always, Rachel.</i>

1269
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:01,531
Prepared a little breakfast.

1270
01:34:05,501 --> 01:34:07,332
- Very well, then.
- Alfred.

1271
01:34:07,501 --> 01:34:08,616
Yes, Master Wayne?

1272
01:34:09,941 --> 01:34:12,091
Did I bring this on her?

1273
01:34:13,101 --> 01:34:15,217
I was meant to inspire good...

1274
01:34:15,381 --> 01:34:17,656
...not madness, not death.

1275
01:34:17,821 --> 01:34:22,258
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1276
01:34:22,421 --> 01:34:24,412
Didn't you think
there might be casualties?

1277
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:26,890
Things always get worse
before they get better.

1278
01:34:27,221 --> 01:34:28,620
But Rachel, Alfred.

1279
01:34:28,781 --> 01:34:32,410
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1280
01:34:32,581 --> 01:34:34,412
...what we stand for.

1281
01:34:34,581 --> 01:34:35,980
Gotham needs you.

1282
01:34:36,501 --> 01:34:39,334
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1283
01:34:39,821 --> 01:34:43,780
...and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1284
01:34:43,941 --> 01:34:46,171
Which is why, for now...

1285
01:34:46,941 --> 01:34:48,772
...they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1286
01:34:50,901 --> 01:34:52,653
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1287
01:34:54,581 --> 01:34:56,537
Dent doesn't know.

1288
01:34:56,701 --> 01:34:57,929
He can never know.

1289
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:01,819
What's that?

1290
01:35:01,981 --> 01:35:04,814
- It can wait.
- That bandit...

1291
01:35:05,261 --> 01:35:07,297
...in the forest in Burma.

1292
01:35:07,461 --> 01:35:09,417
- Did you catch him?
- Yes.

1293
01:35:09,581 --> 01:35:10,855
How?

1294
01:35:12,221 --> 01:35:13,779
We burned the forest down.

1295
01:35:51,421 --> 01:35:53,935
<i>He's credible, an M & A lawyer</i>
<i>from a leading consultancy.</i>

1296
01:35:54,101 --> 01:35:57,332
<i>He says he's waited as long as he can</i>
<i>for Batman to do the right thing.</i>

1297
01:35:57,501 --> 01:35:59,492
<i>Now he's taking matters</i>
<i>into his own hands.</i>

1298
01:35:59,661 --> 01:36:02,494
<i>We'll be live at 5 with</i>
<i>the true identity of the Batman.</i>

1299
01:36:18,261 --> 01:36:19,819
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1300
01:36:22,421 --> 01:36:27,051
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1301
01:36:28,061 --> 01:36:29,938
That you're refusing to...

1302
01:36:30,101 --> 01:36:31,773
...accept skin grafts.

1303
01:36:32,101 --> 01:36:34,251
Remember that name...

1304
01:36:34,821 --> 01:36:37,051
...you all had for me...

1305
01:36:37,501 --> 01:36:40,220
...when I was at Internal Affairs?

1306
01:36:42,581 --> 01:36:43,809
What was it, Gordon?

1307
01:36:44,461 --> 01:36:45,780
Harvey, I...

1308
01:36:45,941 --> 01:36:47,374
Say it.

1309
01:36:48,741 --> 01:36:50,572
Say it!

1310
01:36:57,941 --> 01:37:00,899
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1311
01:37:02,421 --> 01:37:06,539
Why should I hide who I am?

1312
01:37:07,701 --> 01:37:08,975
I know you tried to warn me.

1313
01:37:09,821 --> 01:37:10,970
I'm sorry.

1314
01:37:11,581 --> 01:37:14,095
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1315
01:37:16,301 --> 01:37:18,576
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1316
01:37:19,381 --> 01:37:22,259
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1317
01:37:22,621 --> 01:37:24,657
Why would you listen to me now?

1318
01:37:25,741 --> 01:37:27,333
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1319
01:37:29,781 --> 01:37:31,499
No.

1320
01:37:31,941 --> 01:37:33,977
No, you're not.

1321
01:37:34,981 --> 01:37:36,175
Not yet.

1322
01:37:41,221 --> 01:37:43,815
This craziness, it's too much.

1323
01:37:44,021 --> 01:37:47,138
Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1324
01:37:47,301 --> 01:37:48,973
You want him?

1325
01:37:51,341 --> 01:37:53,571
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1326
01:38:01,301 --> 01:38:03,496
Not so crazy as you look.

1327
01:38:03,661 --> 01:38:07,256
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1328
01:38:10,341 --> 01:38:11,535
Where is the Italian?

1329
01:38:11,701 --> 01:38:14,693
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1330
01:38:14,861 --> 01:38:18,171
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1331
01:38:18,741 --> 01:38:19,856
Please.

1332
01:38:20,021 --> 01:38:23,218
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1333
01:38:23,861 --> 01:38:26,421
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1334
01:38:26,581 --> 01:38:28,173
I enjoy...

1335
01:38:28,341 --> 01:38:29,660
...dynamite...

1336
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:31,300
...and gunpowder...

1337
01:38:31,741 --> 01:38:34,050
...and gasoline.

1338
01:38:35,461 --> 01:38:37,611
- What the...?
- Ah, ah, ah.

1339
01:38:39,381 --> 01:38:42,100
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1340
01:38:42,581 --> 01:38:43,809
They're cheap.

1341
01:38:43,981 --> 01:38:46,541
<i>How much are they</i>
<i>paying you to say who Batman is?</i>

1342
01:38:46,701 --> 01:38:50,489
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1343
01:38:50,661 --> 01:38:52,014
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1344
01:38:52,181 --> 01:38:53,455
<i>Let's take the next caller.</i>

1345
01:38:53,621 --> 01:38:55,691
<i>Harvey Dent didn't wanna</i>
<i>give in to this maniac.</i>

1346
01:38:55,861 --> 01:38:57,089
<i>You think you know better?</i>

1347
01:38:57,261 --> 01:39:00,492
<i>I think that if we could talk to Dent</i>
<i>today, he may feel differently.</i>

1348
01:39:00,661 --> 01:39:04,574
<i>And we wish him a speedy recovery.</i>
<i>Because God knows, we need him now.</i>

1349
01:39:04,741 --> 01:39:06,857
You said you were a man of your word.

1350
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:09,097
Oh, I am.

1351
01:39:10,741 --> 01:39:13,301
I'm only burning my half.

1352
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:16,617
All you care about is money.

1353
01:39:16,781 --> 01:39:20,091
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1354
01:39:20,261 --> 01:39:22,411
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1355
01:39:23,181 --> 01:39:25,570
Tell your men they work for me now.

1356
01:39:25,741 --> 01:39:28,016
This is my city.

1357
01:39:28,661 --> 01:39:31,095
They won't work for a freak.

1358
01:39:31,261 --> 01:39:32,899
"Freak."

1359
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:35,416
Why don't we
cut you up into little pieces...

1360
01:39:35,581 --> 01:39:36,980
...and feed you to your pooches? Hm?

1361
01:39:37,141 --> 01:39:39,894
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1362
01:39:41,821 --> 01:39:44,051
It's not about money...

1363
01:39:44,221 --> 01:39:47,293
...it's about sending a message.

1364
01:39:48,061 --> 01:39:50,416
Everything burns.

1365
01:39:52,821 --> 01:39:54,891
<i>- Who is this?</i>
<i>- I had a vision...</i>

1366
01:39:55,061 --> 01:39:57,700
<i>... of a world without Batman.</i>

1367
01:39:57,861 --> 01:40:00,011
<i>The Mob ground out a little profit...</i>

1368
01:40:00,181 --> 01:40:03,935
<i>... and the police tried to shut them down</i>
<i>one block at a time.</i>

1369
01:40:04,101 --> 01:40:07,252
<i>And it was so boring.</i>

1370
01:40:07,421 --> 01:40:09,298
<i>I've had a change of heart.</i>

1371
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:11,975
<i>I don't want Mr. Reese</i>
<i>spoiling everything...</i>

1372
01:40:12,141 --> 01:40:16,657
<i>... but why should I have all the fun?</i>
<i>Let's give someone else a chance.</i>

1373
01:40:16,821 --> 01:40:21,451
<i>If Coleman Reese</i>
<i>isn't dead in 60 minutes...</i>

1374
01:40:21,621 --> 01:40:23,612
<i>... then I blow up a hospital.</i>

1375
01:40:23,781 --> 01:40:25,294
Call in every officer.

1376
01:40:25,461 --> 01:40:28,658
Tell them to head to their nearest
hospital and start evac and search.

1377
01:40:28,821 --> 01:40:30,857
Call the transit authority,
school board, prisons.

1378
01:40:31,021 --> 01:40:32,579
Get every bus down to a hospital.

1379
01:40:32,741 --> 01:40:37,132
The priority is Gotham General. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1380
01:40:37,301 --> 01:40:38,893
You, you and you, you come with me.

1381
01:40:39,061 --> 01:40:40,858
- Where are we going, sir?
- To get Reese.

1382
01:40:41,181 --> 01:40:44,139
I need you plugged in, checking
Gordon's men and their families.

1383
01:40:44,301 --> 01:40:46,417
- Looking for?
- Hospital admissions.

1384
01:40:46,581 --> 01:40:48,173
Will you be wanting the Batpod?

1385
01:40:48,341 --> 01:40:50,218
In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.

1386
01:40:50,381 --> 01:40:51,609
The Lamborghini, then.

1387
01:40:52,501 --> 01:40:53,570
Much more subtle.

1388
01:41:06,861 --> 01:41:09,250
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1389
01:41:09,421 --> 01:41:12,777
Sir, could you help, please?

1390
01:41:12,941 --> 01:41:14,579
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1391
01:41:16,461 --> 01:41:18,258
Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1392
01:41:18,421 --> 01:41:20,491
...an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1393
01:41:24,821 --> 01:41:27,051
Sir. Commissioner.

1394
01:41:29,061 --> 01:41:31,177
Get the cars around the back!

1395
01:41:33,461 --> 01:41:34,735
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1396
01:41:40,461 --> 01:41:42,338
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1397
01:41:42,901 --> 01:41:46,257
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1398
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:50,891
They're trying to kill me.
- Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1399
01:42:03,501 --> 01:42:06,015
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1400
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:09,339
Davis.

1401
01:42:14,261 --> 01:42:16,491
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1402
01:42:16,661 --> 01:42:17,810
<i>Nothing on them.</i>

1403
01:42:17,981 --> 01:42:19,380
And a patrolman I don't know.

1404
01:42:20,541 --> 01:42:22,372
Okay, so, what now?

1405
01:42:23,221 --> 01:42:25,371
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1406
01:42:28,021 --> 01:42:29,613
Send the information to Gordon.

1407
01:42:37,181 --> 01:42:38,660
Get out of here.

1408
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:42,339
Davis.

1409
01:42:45,381 --> 01:42:47,690
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1410
01:42:58,901 --> 01:43:01,131
It's Berg, isn't it?
- Commissioner.

1411
01:43:02,221 --> 01:43:03,620
You okay, son?

1412
01:43:20,901 --> 01:43:22,414
Hi.

1413
01:43:27,061 --> 01:43:28,494
You know...

1414
01:43:29,301 --> 01:43:32,259
...I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1415
01:43:32,421 --> 01:43:35,413
- When you and...
- Rachel!

1416
01:43:35,581 --> 01:43:37,776
- Rachel were being abducted...

1417
01:43:37,941 --> 01:43:40,819
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1418
01:43:41,141 --> 01:43:42,972
I didn't rig those charges.

1419
01:43:43,181 --> 01:43:45,536
Your men, your plan.

1420
01:43:45,741 --> 01:43:48,096
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1421
01:43:48,501 --> 01:43:51,174
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1422
01:43:51,781 --> 01:43:54,136
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1423
01:43:54,301 --> 01:43:57,293
You know? I just do things.

1424
01:43:57,661 --> 01:44:01,210
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1425
01:44:01,381 --> 01:44:03,497
Gordon's got plans.

1426
01:44:03,661 --> 01:44:06,494
You know, they're schemers.

1427
01:44:06,661 --> 01:44:10,256
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1428
01:44:10,421 --> 01:44:11,854
I'm not a schemer.

1429
01:44:12,021 --> 01:44:13,579
I try to show the schemers...

1430
01:44:13,741 --> 01:44:18,815
...how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1431
01:44:19,741 --> 01:44:22,653
So when I say... Ah. Come here.

1432
01:44:23,141 --> 01:44:26,531
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1433
01:44:28,021 --> 01:44:30,137
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1434
01:44:32,541 --> 01:44:35,214
- I'm gonna need your weapon.
- What?

1435
01:44:38,821 --> 01:44:40,573
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1436
01:44:41,261 --> 01:44:42,740
Yeah, that'd be why.

1437
01:44:43,621 --> 01:44:46,693
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1438
01:44:46,861 --> 01:44:50,490
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1439
01:44:50,661 --> 01:44:52,731
...and look where that got you.

1440
01:45:03,061 --> 01:45:05,336
<i>Police are taking every precaution...</i>

1441
01:45:05,501 --> 01:45:07,537
<i>... urging people not to</i>
<i>take matters into their hands.</i>

1442
01:45:07,701 --> 01:45:10,135
I just did what I do best.

1443
01:45:10,301 --> 01:45:13,771
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.

1444
01:45:13,941 --> 01:45:19,061
Look what I did to this city with a few
drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1445
01:45:19,221 --> 01:45:22,372
Hm? You know what I noticed?

1446
01:45:22,541 --> 01:45:25,931
Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."

1447
01:45:26,101 --> 01:45:27,693
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1448
01:45:28,301 --> 01:45:33,136
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1449
01:45:33,301 --> 01:45:36,611
...or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1450
01:45:36,901 --> 01:45:37,936
...nobody panics.

1451
01:45:38,621 --> 01:45:41,579
Because it's all part of the plan.

1452
01:45:41,741 --> 01:45:46,451
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1453
01:45:46,701 --> 01:45:49,010
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1454
01:45:52,301 --> 01:45:55,099
Introduce a little anarchy...

1455
01:45:56,221 --> 01:45:58,371
...upset the established order...

1456
01:45:58,541 --> 01:46:02,898
...and everything becomes chaos.

1457
01:46:04,661 --> 01:46:07,300
I'm an agent of chaos.

1458
01:46:07,661 --> 01:46:09,891
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1459
01:46:11,861 --> 01:46:13,419
It's fair.

1460
01:46:22,261 --> 01:46:25,298
- You live.
- Mm-hm.

1461
01:46:25,781 --> 01:46:27,339
You die.

1462
01:46:27,541 --> 01:46:29,452
Mmm. Now we're talking.

1463
01:46:38,421 --> 01:46:39,854
Mr. Reese.

1464
01:46:57,301 --> 01:46:59,371
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1465
01:46:59,541 --> 01:47:02,419
- That was a very brave thing you did.
- Trying to catch the light?

1466
01:47:02,741 --> 01:47:05,460
- You weren't protecting the van?
- Why? Who's in it?

1467
01:47:10,701 --> 01:47:12,692
Don't you think
I should go to the hospital?

1468
01:47:12,861 --> 01:47:15,250
Don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1469
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:20,453
Southeast.

1470
01:48:20,621 --> 01:48:22,737
It's Gotham General.

1471
01:48:23,461 --> 01:48:25,053
- Did you clear the building?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1472
01:48:27,941 --> 01:48:29,579
You must know
how many were inside.

1473
01:48:29,741 --> 01:48:31,060
You have patient lists, roll call.

1474
01:48:31,221 --> 01:48:33,451
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1475
01:48:33,621 --> 01:48:36,658
The other buses were heading off to
hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1476
01:48:36,821 --> 01:48:38,857
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1477
01:48:39,021 --> 01:48:43,299
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1478
01:48:45,781 --> 01:48:48,090
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1479
01:48:49,221 --> 01:48:50,893
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1480
01:48:51,061 --> 01:48:52,619
<i>- people are still missing...</i>

1481
01:48:52,781 --> 01:48:53,930
<i>... including GCN's own Mike Engel.</i>

1482
01:48:54,101 --> 01:48:57,218
<i>I'm now being told that we're cutting to</i>
<i>a video GCN has just received.</i>

1483
01:48:57,381 --> 01:48:59,212
<i>I'm Mike Engel for</i> Gotham Tonight.

1484
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:02,898
<i>"What does it take</i>
<i>to make you people wanna join in?</i>

1485
01:49:03,061 --> 01:49:05,529
<i>You failed to kill the lawyer.</i>
<i>I've gotta get you off the bench...</i>

1486
01:49:05,701 --> 01:49:07,373
<i>...and into the game.</i>
<i>- Bench. Game.</i>

1487
01:49:09,461 --> 01:49:11,497
<i>Come nightfall, this city is mine.</i>
<i>- Mine.</i>

1488
01:49:11,661 --> 01:49:14,300
<i>- And anyone left here plays by my rules.</i>
<i>- Rules.</i>

1489
01:49:14,581 --> 01:49:17,778
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R & D Department.

1490
01:49:17,941 --> 01:49:19,977
<i>If you don't wanna be in the game...</i>

1491
01:49:20,141 --> 01:49:21,460
<i>...get out now.</i>
<i>- Get out now.</i>

1492
01:49:23,541 --> 01:49:26,374
<i>But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd</i>
<i>are sure in for a surprise.</i>

1493
01:49:26,741 --> 01:49:28,379
<i>Ha-ha, ha-ha. "

1494
01:50:00,661 --> 01:50:01,889
<i>Gotham P.D.</i>
<i>has shut down...</i>

1495
01:50:02,061 --> 01:50:04,416
Sweet Jesus.
<i>...the area 's bridges and tunnels.</i>

1496
01:50:04,581 --> 01:50:07,857
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1497
01:50:08,021 --> 01:50:09,898
It's my day off.

1498
01:50:10,501 --> 01:50:12,014
I gotta take a leak.

1499
01:50:12,181 --> 01:50:14,411
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1500
01:50:19,781 --> 01:50:21,658
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?

1501
01:50:21,821 --> 01:50:23,334
Hello.

1502
01:50:24,021 --> 01:50:25,454
Dent.

1503
01:50:25,621 --> 01:50:27,737
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1504
01:50:27,901 --> 01:50:29,493
Half.

1505
01:50:35,301 --> 01:50:36,814
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1506
01:50:36,981 --> 01:50:38,892
- It must've been Maroni's men.
- Shut up!

1507
01:50:40,581 --> 01:50:42,617
Are you telling me
that you're gonna protect...

1508
01:50:42,781 --> 01:50:44,453
...the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1509
01:50:44,621 --> 01:50:46,020
I don't know, he never told me.

1510
01:50:46,181 --> 01:50:49,651
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't
know what they were gonna do to you.

1511
01:50:51,141 --> 01:50:52,256
That's funny...

1512
01:50:53,941 --> 01:50:56,580
...because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1513
01:51:00,541 --> 01:51:02,372
Beautiful, isn't it?

1514
01:51:02,741 --> 01:51:04,333
Beautiful.

1515
01:51:04,861 --> 01:51:05,930
Unethical.

1516
01:51:07,061 --> 01:51:08,540
Dangerous.

1517
01:51:08,741 --> 01:51:12,097
You've turned every cell phone
in Gotham into a microphone.

1518
01:51:12,261 --> 01:51:14,570
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1519
01:51:14,741 --> 01:51:19,610
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1520
01:51:19,781 --> 01:51:24,172
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1521
01:51:26,021 --> 01:51:27,340
This is wrong.

1522
01:51:27,501 --> 01:51:29,457
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1523
01:51:31,381 --> 01:51:32,609
At what cost?

1524
01:51:32,781 --> 01:51:35,454
The database is null-key encrypted.

1525
01:51:35,621 --> 01:51:37,737
It can only be accessed by one person.

1526
01:51:39,021 --> 01:51:41,091
This is too much power for one person.

1527
01:51:41,261 --> 01:51:43,331
That's why I gave it to you.

1528
01:51:43,781 --> 01:51:44,930
Only you can use it.

1529
01:51:45,101 --> 01:51:48,730
Spying on 30 million people
isn't part of my job description.

1530
01:51:50,861 --> 01:51:54,410
This is an audio sample. If he talks
within range of any phone in the city...

1531
01:51:54,581 --> 01:51:56,697
...you can triangulate his position.

1532
01:51:57,141 --> 01:51:59,530
I'll help you this one time.

1533
01:51:59,981 --> 01:52:01,699
But consider this my resignation.

1534
01:52:01,861 --> 01:52:06,252
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1535
01:52:06,981 --> 01:52:08,812
When you're finished...

1536
01:52:09,461 --> 01:52:10,530
...type in your name.

1537
01:52:18,781 --> 01:52:21,739
My officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1538
01:52:21,901 --> 01:52:24,973
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1539
01:52:25,141 --> 01:52:27,860
- And land routes east?
- Backed up for hours.

1540
01:52:28,021 --> 01:52:31,491
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1541
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:34,573
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the island.

1542
01:52:34,901 --> 01:52:37,574
The men you put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1543
01:52:37,741 --> 01:52:39,777
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1544
01:52:39,941 --> 01:52:44,253
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are
involved. I wanna get them out of here.

1545
01:52:45,661 --> 01:52:46,810
So where is Harvey?

1546
01:52:47,381 --> 01:52:50,418
- We haven't found him.
- Oh, Jesus.

1547
01:52:54,101 --> 01:52:56,092
How long can you keep this quiet?

1548
01:53:09,621 --> 01:53:12,181
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1549
01:53:12,981 --> 01:53:15,051
Going to join your wife?

1550
01:53:18,421 --> 01:53:20,810
- You love her?
- Yes.

1551
01:53:21,661 --> 01:53:24,494
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?

1552
01:53:24,661 --> 01:53:26,094
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1553
01:53:26,261 --> 01:53:29,378
He killed your woman. He made you...

1554
01:53:29,541 --> 01:53:30,530
...like this.

1555
01:53:30,901 --> 01:53:33,779
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1556
01:53:33,941 --> 01:53:36,455
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1557
01:53:37,141 --> 01:53:40,338
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1558
01:53:40,501 --> 01:53:43,015
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1559
01:53:44,181 --> 01:53:46,217
Look, if I tell you...

1560
01:53:46,381 --> 01:53:47,370
...will you let me go?

1561
01:53:48,101 --> 01:53:49,375
Can't hurt your chances.

1562
01:53:52,021 --> 01:53:53,613
It was Ramirez.

1563
01:53:58,821 --> 01:54:01,938
- But you said...
- I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1564
01:54:05,381 --> 01:54:07,417
You're a lucky man.

1565
01:54:10,741 --> 01:54:12,413
- But he's not.
- Who?

1566
01:54:15,221 --> 01:54:16,574
Your driver.

1567
01:54:29,261 --> 01:54:30,250
Stand back.

1568
01:54:30,421 --> 01:54:32,651
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1569
01:54:32,821 --> 01:54:35,289
You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1570
01:54:57,581 --> 01:54:59,219
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1571
01:54:59,381 --> 01:55:00,370
Right, get on the radio.

1572
01:55:00,541 --> 01:55:04,011
Tell them we'll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scumbags.

1573
01:55:04,181 --> 01:55:06,456
<i>Liberty,</i> this is <i>Spirit.</i> Come in.

1574
01:55:08,421 --> 01:55:09,570
What the heck was that?

1575
01:55:11,421 --> 01:55:12,820
What the...?

1576
01:55:13,341 --> 01:55:16,492
Liberty,
<i>come in, please. This is</i> Spirit. <i>Come in.</i>

1577
01:55:18,061 --> 01:55:19,858
Liberty, <i>we have the same thing.</i>
<i>We've lost both engines.</i>

1578
01:55:20,021 --> 01:55:21,454
- Liberty, <i>come in.</i>
- Fox.

1579
01:55:21,621 --> 01:55:24,010
<i>There's something going on</i>
<i>on the ferries.</i>

1580
01:55:24,741 --> 01:55:26,936
Get down to the engine room now.

1581
01:55:27,541 --> 01:55:29,657
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1582
01:55:37,901 --> 01:55:41,211
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1583
01:55:53,781 --> 01:55:54,816
Oh, my God.

1584
01:55:54,981 --> 01:55:56,733
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1585
01:55:56,901 --> 01:55:59,654
Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1586
01:56:02,461 --> 01:56:03,780
<i>Tonight, you're all gonna...</i>

1587
01:56:03,941 --> 01:56:05,613
<i>... be a part of a social experiment.</i>

1588
01:56:09,301 --> 01:56:12,976
<i>Through the magic of diesel fuel</i>
<i>and ammonium nitrate...</i>

1589
01:56:13,141 --> 01:56:17,054
<i>... I'm ready right now</i>
<i>to blow you all sky-high.</i>

1590
01:56:17,221 --> 01:56:19,212
<i>Liberty,</i> come in, over.

1591
01:56:20,621 --> 01:56:21,610
It's dead.

1592
01:56:21,941 --> 01:56:26,253
<i>If anyone attempts</i>
<i>to get off their boat, you all die.</i>

1593
01:56:26,581 --> 01:56:27,809
<i>I'm zeroing in.</i>

1594
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:32,338
<i>Each of you has a remote</i>
<i>to blow up the other boat.</i>

1595
01:56:32,501 --> 01:56:34,856
His voice is on the ferry...

1596
01:56:35,021 --> 01:56:36,977
...but it's not the source.

1597
01:56:39,141 --> 01:56:40,210
West.

1598
01:56:47,181 --> 01:56:49,376
- Gordon.
<i>- I have the Joker's location.</i>

1599
01:56:49,541 --> 01:56:50,576
<i>Prewitt Building.</i>

1600
01:56:50,741 --> 01:56:53,096
<i>Assemble on the building opposite.</i>

1601
01:56:54,421 --> 01:56:57,094
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1602
01:56:57,261 --> 01:57:02,210
<i>If, however, one of you presses</i>
<i>the button, I'll let that boat live.</i>

1603
01:57:02,381 --> 01:57:04,417
<i>So who 's it gonna be?</i>

1604
01:57:04,581 --> 01:57:07,015
<i>Harvey Dent's most-wanted</i>
<i>scumbag collection...</i>

1605
01:57:07,181 --> 01:57:10,378
<i>... or the sweet and innocent civilians?</i>

1606
01:57:10,541 --> 01:57:12,975
<i>You choose.</i>

1607
01:57:13,141 --> 01:57:14,972
<i>Oh, and you might wanna</i>
<i>decide quickly...</i>

1608
01:57:15,141 --> 01:57:19,293
<i>... because the people on the other boat</i>
<i>may not be quite so noble.</i>

1609
01:57:26,381 --> 01:57:27,370
Stay back.

1610
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:31,170
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1611
01:57:31,541 --> 01:57:34,977
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1612
01:57:35,581 --> 01:57:39,210
- We are not going to talk about this.
- Why aren't we talking about it?

1613
01:57:39,381 --> 01:57:41,849
They're talking over the same thing
on the other boat.

1614
01:57:42,021 --> 01:57:44,216
- Let's put it to a vote.
- Yes!

1615
01:57:49,301 --> 01:57:51,769
- Hello?
<i>- Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.</i>

1616
01:57:51,941 --> 01:57:54,853
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1617
01:57:55,021 --> 01:57:56,659
But the units outside...

1618
01:57:56,821 --> 01:57:58,334
<i>Those cops can't be trusted.</i>

1619
01:57:58,501 --> 01:58:01,334
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1620
01:58:01,501 --> 01:58:04,334
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1621
01:58:04,501 --> 01:58:08,176
<i>- But where am I supposed to take them?</i>
- 25052nd Street.

1622
01:58:08,341 --> 01:58:10,138
<i>Leave as soon as</i>
<i>the patrol car pulls out.</i>

1623
01:58:10,301 --> 01:58:11,620
Okay.

1624
01:58:11,981 --> 01:58:13,699
She believe you?

1625
01:58:13,901 --> 01:58:15,857
It's because she trusts you...

1626
01:58:16,181 --> 01:58:17,216
...just like Rachel did.

1627
01:58:17,381 --> 01:58:19,372
- I didn't know...
- Didn't know what they'd do?

1628
01:58:19,541 --> 01:58:22,180
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1629
01:58:22,421 --> 01:58:24,457
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1630
01:58:24,621 --> 01:58:26,771
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills...

1631
01:58:26,941 --> 01:58:29,853
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1632
01:58:30,381 --> 01:58:32,736
You live to fight another day, officer.

1633
01:58:36,381 --> 01:58:38,133
We found the missing hospital bus.

1634
01:58:38,301 --> 01:58:39,939
Then we have a hostage situation.

1635
01:58:41,941 --> 01:58:43,852
It's a shooting gallery.

1636
01:58:44,221 --> 01:58:46,416
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1637
01:58:46,581 --> 01:58:48,333
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1638
01:58:48,501 --> 01:58:51,140
<i>Snipers take them out,</i>
<i>smash the windows, a team rappels in.</i>

1639
01:58:51,541 --> 01:58:52,974
<i>Team moves in by the stairwells.</i>

1640
01:58:53,141 --> 01:58:55,177
<i>Two, three casualties max.</i>

1641
01:58:55,341 --> 01:58:57,138
- Let's do it.
- It's not that simple.

1642
01:58:57,301 --> 01:58:59,531
- With the Joker, it never is.
- What's simple is...

1643
01:58:59,701 --> 01:59:02,738
...every second, those people on
the ferries get closer to blowing...

1644
01:59:02,901 --> 01:59:05,335
- That won't happen.
- Then he'll blow both of them up!

1645
01:59:05,501 --> 01:59:09,096
- We don't have time for paper ballots.
- I want everybody to put their votes...

1646
01:59:09,261 --> 01:59:11,172
...on this piece of paper.

1647
01:59:12,181 --> 01:59:14,900
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1648
01:59:15,221 --> 01:59:16,939
Thank you.
Anybody else?

1649
01:59:17,101 --> 01:59:18,853
Coming through. Anybody else?
Thank you.

1650
01:59:19,021 --> 01:59:21,774
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1651
01:59:21,941 --> 01:59:23,420
Come on.

1652
01:59:25,341 --> 01:59:27,377
What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1653
01:59:27,541 --> 01:59:29,418
We're running out of time!

1654
01:59:30,661 --> 01:59:32,413
I need five minutes alone.

1655
01:59:32,581 --> 01:59:34,333
No! There's no time!

1656
01:59:34,501 --> 01:59:35,854
We have clear shots!

1657
01:59:36,021 --> 01:59:38,819
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1658
01:59:38,981 --> 01:59:40,858
I have to save Dent.

1659
01:59:41,021 --> 01:59:42,090
Get ready.

1660
01:59:44,821 --> 01:59:47,381
Two minutes, then we breach.

1661
01:59:52,741 --> 01:59:54,174
Fox, I need picture.

1662
01:59:57,101 --> 01:59:59,456
- Hello?
<i>- Jim, we're in trouble.</i>

1663
02:00:00,661 --> 02:00:02,856
Okay, you got POV on alpha...

1664
02:00:03,861 --> 02:00:05,738
<i>... omni on beta.</i>

1665
02:00:07,141 --> 02:00:10,372
<i>Looks like clowns and hostages</i>
<i>on two floors.</i>

1666
02:00:10,541 --> 02:00:12,850
<i>There's a SWAT team on the stairwell.</i>

1667
02:00:16,021 --> 02:00:18,535
<i>Another SWAT team on the roof.</i>

1668
02:00:20,021 --> 02:00:21,170
Line's clear.

1669
02:00:22,861 --> 02:00:25,455
- Barbara, calm down.
<i>- He has the kids!</i>

1670
02:00:25,621 --> 02:00:28,738
<i>Hello, Jim.</i>
- Harvey?

1671
02:00:29,501 --> 02:00:32,573
- Where's my family?
<i>- Where my family died.</i>

1672
02:00:35,541 --> 02:00:37,133
<i>Blue team, acquire the target.</i>

1673
02:00:38,741 --> 02:00:41,209
<i>Entry team, set your charge.</i>

1674
02:00:56,501 --> 02:00:58,253
<i>Fox, the SWATs are</i>
<i>targeting the wrong people.</i>

1675
02:00:58,421 --> 02:00:59,854
<i>The clowns are the hostages.</i>

1676
02:01:00,541 --> 02:01:02,259
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1677
02:01:05,861 --> 02:01:07,214
<i>Entry team, blow and go!</i>

1678
02:01:11,141 --> 02:01:12,494
Don't move.

1679
02:01:13,621 --> 02:01:14,940
<i>Take the shot.</i>

1680
02:01:20,341 --> 02:01:21,933
<i>Those SWATs are coming in hot.</i>

1681
02:01:22,101 --> 02:01:23,853
Clowns, put down your guns.

1682
02:01:24,341 --> 02:01:26,855
Drop your weapons!
- On the ground, now!

1683
02:01:27,061 --> 02:01:30,098
Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap...

1684
02:01:53,701 --> 02:01:54,816
Freeze!

1685
02:01:54,981 --> 02:01:57,256
Stand down or you will be...

1686
02:02:00,661 --> 02:02:02,060
<i>Look up.</i>

1687
02:02:02,621 --> 02:02:05,089
<i>See those bad guys on the floor above?</i>

1688
02:02:05,261 --> 02:02:08,139
<i>They're waiting to ambush</i>
<i>the SWAT team coming up the elevator.</i>

1689
02:02:08,581 --> 02:02:09,570
<i>Sixty seconds.</i>

1690
02:02:17,541 --> 02:02:21,932
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1691
02:02:29,741 --> 02:02:32,175
So go ahead. Do it.

1692
02:02:32,341 --> 02:02:34,252
We're still here.

1693
02:02:35,381 --> 02:02:38,214
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1694
02:02:39,621 --> 02:02:41,293
Go, go, go!

1695
02:02:41,461 --> 02:02:43,179
Blue team, cover!

1696
02:02:46,021 --> 02:02:47,010
Uh-oh.

1697
02:02:48,461 --> 02:02:50,053
<i>Trouble on the floor above.</i>

1698
02:02:59,021 --> 02:03:00,340
Get down on the ground now!

1699
02:03:08,421 --> 02:03:10,730
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1700
02:03:10,901 --> 02:03:12,812
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1701
02:03:12,981 --> 02:03:14,460
Release the officer right now.

1702
02:03:14,621 --> 02:03:16,498
Let him go now!
On your knees!

1703
02:03:17,061 --> 02:03:19,052
We got him. He's out of the game.

1704
02:03:19,221 --> 02:03:21,610
Keep your hands in the air!
- Step away from the edge!

1705
02:03:29,341 --> 02:03:30,899
Halt!

1706
02:03:43,661 --> 02:03:44,980
Stay down!
- Don't move!

1707
02:03:45,141 --> 02:03:49,259
<i>Be advised. Clowns</i>
<i>are hostages, doctors are targets.</i>

1708
02:03:55,301 --> 02:03:57,371
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1709
02:03:57,541 --> 02:04:00,578
- Where's the detonator?
- Go get him.

1710
02:04:13,421 --> 02:04:16,379
Put down your weapon!
- Don't move!

1711
02:04:46,501 --> 02:04:48,298
You don't wanna die...

1712
02:04:48,461 --> 02:04:51,373
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1713
02:04:51,541 --> 02:04:53,133
Give it to me.

1714
02:04:53,421 --> 02:04:57,573
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1715
02:05:00,861 --> 02:05:03,250
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1716
02:05:03,421 --> 02:05:06,254
Fine. I'll do it.

1717
02:05:07,861 --> 02:05:10,455
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1718
02:05:10,621 --> 02:05:12,816
They chose to murder and steal.

1719
02:05:12,981 --> 02:05:16,053
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1720
02:05:25,141 --> 02:05:27,496
All the old familiar places.

1721
02:05:33,541 --> 02:05:34,576
Stand by.

1722
02:05:44,501 --> 02:05:47,937
Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1723
02:05:48,141 --> 02:05:50,132
Give it to me.

1724
02:05:51,501 --> 02:05:55,096
You can tell them I took it by force.

1725
02:05:55,581 --> 02:06:00,291
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1726
02:06:21,461 --> 02:06:24,658
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1727
02:06:24,821 --> 02:06:26,573
There won't be any fireworks.

1728
02:06:26,981 --> 02:06:30,053
And here we go.

1729
02:07:07,781 --> 02:07:09,612
What were you trying to prove?

1730
02:07:09,781 --> 02:07:12,614
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1731
02:07:13,701 --> 02:07:14,690
You're alone.

1732
02:07:21,021 --> 02:07:26,300
Can't rely on anyone these days. You
gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1733
02:07:26,501 --> 02:07:29,220
That's okay. I came prepared.

1734
02:07:29,421 --> 02:07:33,699
It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1735
02:07:33,861 --> 02:07:36,580
No, but I know how you got these.

1736
02:07:53,661 --> 02:07:56,300
Oh, you.

1737
02:07:56,461 --> 02:07:59,373
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1738
02:08:00,461 --> 02:08:04,215
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...

1739
02:08:04,381 --> 02:08:08,659
...meets an immovable object.

1740
02:08:09,221 --> 02:08:14,420
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1741
02:08:14,581 --> 02:08:17,175
Huh? You won't kill me...

1742
02:08:17,341 --> 02:08:23,337
...out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1743
02:08:23,501 --> 02:08:26,573
And I won't kill you...

1744
02:08:26,741 --> 02:08:30,370
...because you're just too much fun.

1745
02:08:31,381 --> 02:08:35,374
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1746
02:08:35,541 --> 02:08:37,452
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1747
02:08:37,621 --> 02:08:39,373
Maybe we could share one.

1748
02:08:39,541 --> 02:08:40,940
You know,
they'll be doubling up...

1749
02:08:41,101 --> 02:08:43,535
...the rate this city's inhabitants
are losing their minds.

1750
02:08:43,701 --> 02:08:46,693
This city just showed you...

1751
02:08:46,861 --> 02:08:50,740
...that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1752
02:08:50,901 --> 02:08:53,938
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1753
02:08:54,781 --> 02:08:59,411
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1754
02:08:59,581 --> 02:09:02,254
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1755
02:09:03,861 --> 02:09:08,696
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...

1756
02:09:08,861 --> 02:09:11,659
...in a fistfight with you?

1757
02:09:12,181 --> 02:09:13,660
No.

1758
02:09:13,821 --> 02:09:17,097
You need an ace in the hole.

1759
02:09:17,261 --> 02:09:18,819
Mine's Harvey.

1760
02:09:19,181 --> 02:09:20,819
What did you do?

1761
02:09:20,981 --> 02:09:23,859
I took Gotham's white knight...

1762
02:09:24,021 --> 02:09:27,491
...and I brought him down to our level.

1763
02:09:27,901 --> 02:09:30,734
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1764
02:09:30,901 --> 02:09:33,813
...is like gravity.

1765
02:09:33,981 --> 02:09:36,211
All it takes is a little push.

1766
02:09:52,461 --> 02:09:54,133
Dent!

1767
02:10:14,261 --> 02:10:18,413
This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1768
02:10:19,141 --> 02:10:20,654
This is where she died.

1769
02:10:20,821 --> 02:10:23,051
I know, I was here...

1770
02:10:24,061 --> 02:10:26,700
...trying to save her.
- But you didn't.

1771
02:10:26,981 --> 02:10:28,653
- I couldn't.
- Yes, you could've.

1772
02:10:28,821 --> 02:10:30,254
If you'd listened to me.

1773
02:10:30,421 --> 02:10:32,935
If you stood up against corruption...

1774
02:10:33,101 --> 02:10:35,217
...instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1775
02:10:35,381 --> 02:10:36,939
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1776
02:10:37,421 --> 02:10:42,051
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1777
02:10:43,301 --> 02:10:46,293
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...

1778
02:10:46,461 --> 02:10:50,170
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1779
02:10:51,781 --> 02:10:55,490
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1780
02:10:56,221 --> 02:10:59,930
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1781
02:11:01,621 --> 02:11:05,057
- You're not going to hurt my family.
- No.

1782
02:11:05,221 --> 02:11:07,815
Just the person you love most.

1783
02:11:15,501 --> 02:11:18,413
So is it your wife?

1784
02:11:19,461 --> 02:11:21,053
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1785
02:11:21,421 --> 02:11:23,013
Harvey, put down the gun.

1786
02:11:23,181 --> 02:11:26,571
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1787
02:11:27,901 --> 02:11:29,129
Oh, goddamn it.

1788
02:11:29,301 --> 02:11:31,371
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1789
02:11:31,861 --> 02:11:33,453
No!
- We have a winner.

1790
02:11:33,621 --> 02:11:35,054
No, Jim, stop him!

1791
02:11:35,541 --> 02:11:37,293
Harvey.
- Don't let him...

1792
02:11:37,461 --> 02:11:38,530
Harvey!

1793
02:11:39,861 --> 02:11:41,658
I'm sorry!

1794
02:11:43,381 --> 02:11:44,416
For everything.

1795
02:11:46,901 --> 02:11:49,017
Please don't hurt my son.

1796
02:11:58,741 --> 02:12:00,254
You brought your cops?

1797
02:12:00,421 --> 02:12:03,174
All they know is there's a situation.

1798
02:12:03,341 --> 02:12:06,219
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1799
02:12:06,381 --> 02:12:08,941
You think I wanna escape from this?

1800
02:12:09,101 --> 02:12:11,740
There is no escape from this.

1801
02:12:11,901 --> 02:12:13,937
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1802
02:12:16,141 --> 02:12:19,213
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1803
02:12:19,941 --> 02:12:23,980
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1804
02:12:26,661 --> 02:12:27,696
But you were wrong.

1805
02:12:28,381 --> 02:12:32,010
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1806
02:12:32,741 --> 02:12:34,572
...is chance.

1807
02:12:34,741 --> 02:12:36,379
Unbiased.

1808
02:12:36,581 --> 02:12:37,775
Unprejudiced.

1809
02:12:39,101 --> 02:12:40,170
Fair.

1810
02:12:40,341 --> 02:12:42,491
His son's got the same chance she had.

1811
02:12:43,221 --> 02:12:44,449
Fifty-fifty.

1812
02:12:44,621 --> 02:12:47,931
What happened to Rachel wasn't
chance. We decided to act.

1813
02:12:48,261 --> 02:12:49,535
We three.

1814
02:12:49,701 --> 02:12:52,977
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1815
02:12:55,381 --> 02:12:57,895
- It wasn't.
- The Joker chose me.

1816
02:12:58,061 --> 02:13:00,256
Because you were the best of us.

1817
02:13:00,421 --> 02:13:05,211
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1818
02:13:05,381 --> 02:13:07,053
...could fall.

1819
02:13:07,381 --> 02:13:08,609
And he was right.

1820
02:13:08,781 --> 02:13:10,931
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1821
02:13:11,101 --> 02:13:14,013
So point it at the people responsible.

1822
02:13:14,941 --> 02:13:16,693
Fair enough.

1823
02:13:19,901 --> 02:13:21,698
You first.

1824
02:13:33,701 --> 02:13:35,293
My turn.

1825
02:13:41,941 --> 02:13:43,852
Harvey, you're right.

1826
02:13:44,861 --> 02:13:47,375
Rachel's death was my fault.

1827
02:13:50,341 --> 02:13:52,696
Please don't punish the boy.

1828
02:13:53,741 --> 02:13:56,813
- Please, punish me.
- I'm about to.

1829
02:13:58,701 --> 02:14:00,578
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1830
02:14:01,021 --> 02:14:02,579
Lie...

1831
02:14:03,061 --> 02:14:04,130
...like I lied.

1832
02:14:07,741 --> 02:14:09,254
It's going to be all right, son.

1833
02:14:46,101 --> 02:14:48,820
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1834
02:15:04,661 --> 02:15:06,731
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

1835
02:15:07,341 --> 02:15:09,059
Yes, I do.

1836
02:15:13,141 --> 02:15:14,415
The Joker won.

1837
02:15:16,741 --> 02:15:19,494
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1838
02:15:20,021 --> 02:15:21,693
...undone.

1839
02:15:22,181 --> 02:15:26,891
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1840
02:15:27,061 --> 02:15:28,176
We bet it all on him.

1841
02:15:29,461 --> 02:15:32,214
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1842
02:15:32,781 --> 02:15:34,134
People will lose hope.

1843
02:15:34,301 --> 02:15:35,973
They won't.

1844
02:15:38,381 --> 02:15:40,178
They must never know what he did.

1845
02:15:40,341 --> 02:15:42,093
Five dead.

1846
02:15:42,381 --> 02:15:43,609
Two of them cops.

1847
02:15:43,781 --> 02:15:46,136
- You can't sweep that...
- No.

1848
02:15:50,741 --> 02:15:53,460
But the Joker cannot win.

1849
02:15:58,501 --> 02:16:01,573
Gotham needs its true hero.

1850
02:16:07,701 --> 02:16:10,613
- No.
- You either die a hero...

1851
02:16:10,781 --> 02:16:15,059
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1852
02:16:15,221 --> 02:16:16,973
I can do those things...

1853
02:16:17,381 --> 02:16:20,293
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1854
02:16:23,181 --> 02:16:25,934
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1855
02:16:26,101 --> 02:16:27,932
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1856
02:16:28,101 --> 02:16:30,569
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1857
02:16:32,181 --> 02:16:33,250
Call it in.

1858
02:16:36,421 --> 02:16:38,093
A hero.

1859
02:16:38,261 --> 02:16:41,378
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1860
02:16:41,941 --> 02:16:44,375
Nothing less than a knight...

1861
02:16:44,901 --> 02:16:46,539
...shining.

1862
02:16:47,141 --> 02:16:48,699
<i>They'll hunt you.</i>

1863
02:16:48,861 --> 02:16:50,579
<i>You'll hunt me.</i>

1864
02:16:51,061 --> 02:16:52,938
<i>You'll condemn me.</i>

1865
02:16:53,621 --> 02:16:55,816
<i>Set the dogs on me.</i>

1866
02:16:59,421 --> 02:17:01,616
<i>Because that's what needs to happen.</i>

1867
02:17:02,741 --> 02:17:04,572
<i>Because sometimes...</i>

1868
02:17:04,741 --> 02:17:06,811
<i>... the truth isn't good enough.</i>

1869
02:17:07,661 --> 02:17:09,856
<i>Sometimes people deserve more.</i>

1870
02:17:13,181 --> 02:17:16,935
<i>Sometimes people deserve</i>
<i>to have their faith rewarded.</i>

1871
02:17:34,581 --> 02:17:36,173
Batman.

1872
02:17:38,021 --> 02:17:39,693
Batman!

1873
02:17:40,461 --> 02:17:42,338
Why's he running, Dad?

1874
02:17:43,341 --> 02:17:44,615
Because we have to chase him.

1875
02:17:44,781 --> 02:17:47,534
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1876
02:17:53,381 --> 02:17:54,894
He didn't do anything wrong.

1877
02:17:57,541 --> 02:18:02,899
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1878
02:18:04,261 --> 02:18:05,250
<i>So we'll hunt him...</i>

1879
02:18:08,261 --> 02:18:10,252
<i>... because he can take it.</i>

1880
02:18:12,661 --> 02:18:15,050
<i>Because he's not our hero.</i>

1881
02:18:22,301 --> 02:18:23,507
<i>He's a
silent guardian...</i>

1882
02:18:24,681 --> 02:18:26,378
...a watchful protector.

1883
02:18:28,781 --> 02:18:30,007
<i>A dark
knight.</i>

1884
02:25:50,981 --> 02:25:52,972
