1
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:19,029
Sméagol!

2
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:21,448
I've got one!

3
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:24,076
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

4
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:27,371
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:37,422
Déagol!

6
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:36,648
Déagol?

7
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,445
Déagol.

8
00:02:57,252 --> 00:02:59,337
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

9
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,594
Why?

10
00:03:06,678 --> 00:03:08,930
Because...

11
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:12,851
...it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:52,159
My precious.

13
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,627
<i>They cursed us.</i>

14
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:04,171
<i>Murderer.</i>

15
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,798
<i>"Murderer" they called us.</i>

16
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:11,762
<i>They cursed us
and drove us away.</i>

17
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:14,598
Gollum.

18
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:16,475
Gollum.

19
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:18,602
Gollum.

20
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:25,150
<i>And we wept, precious.</i>

21
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:28,904
<i>We wept to be so alone.</i>

22
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,285
<i>And cool, so nice for feet.</i>

23
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:40,665
<i>And we only wish,
to catch a fish.</i>

24
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:44,086
<i>So juicy sweet.</i>

25
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,970
<i>And we forgot the taste of bread...</i>

26
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:57,766
<i>...the sound of trees...</i>

27
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:01,853
<i>...the softness of the wind.</i>

28
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,151
<i>We even forgot our own name.</i>

29
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:22,708
<i>My precious.</i>

30
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,212
Wake up!

31
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:11,923
Wake up!

32
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,884
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:15,927
We must go, yes.

34
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:18,764
We must go at once.

35
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,395
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:30,150
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:33,278
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:34,946
No.

39
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:37,032
It isn't.

40
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,243
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,996
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,461
Come on!

43
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,132
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,676
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

45
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,721
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,773
Here.

47
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:14,820
What about you?

48
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:18,365
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:20,325
Sam.

50
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:24,454
All right.

51
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:27,124
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,168
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

53
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:35,257
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:36,842
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,010
There should be enough.

56
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,389
For what?

57
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,809
The journey home.

58
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,986
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:59,239
Very close now.

60
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,659
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:05,495
No safe places here.

62
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:07,831
Hurry.

63
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:01,927
It's good.

64
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:04,596
Definitely from the Shire.

65
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,934
Longbottom Leaf.

66
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:18,610
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon.

67
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:22,948
- Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

68
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:27,703
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

69
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:31,748
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

70
00:10:44,553 --> 00:10:47,597
Welcome, my lords...

71
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:50,016
...to Isengard!

72
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:54,146
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

73
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:59,317
...and now we find you feasting
and... and smoking!

74
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:02,654
We are sitting on a field of victory...

75
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:06,324
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

76
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:11,246
The salted pork is particularly good.

77
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:14,166
Salted pork?

78
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,795
- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

79
00:11:18,962 --> 00:11:21,798
...who's taken over management
of Isengard.

80
00:11:24,342 --> 00:11:27,345
Young Master Gandalf.

81
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:32,100
I'm glad you've come.

82
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:36,688
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

83
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:40,525
But there is a wizard to manage here...

84
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:42,694
...locked in his tower.

85
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:46,698
Show yourself.

86
00:11:46,948 --> 00:11:48,658
Be careful.

87
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:52,120
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

88
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:54,414
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

89
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,625
No.

90
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,294
We need him alive.

91
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:02,881
We need him to talk.

92
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:08,970
You have fought many wars
and slain many men, Théoden King...

93
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:10,639
...and made peace afterwards.

94
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:15,769
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

95
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:19,147
Can we not have peace, you and I?

96
00:12:19,314 --> 00:12:21,233
We shall have peace.

97
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:25,278
We shall have peace...

98
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:29,491
...when you answer
for the burning of the Westfold...

99
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:32,411
...and the children that lie dead there!

100
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:37,332
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

101
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:39,584
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

102
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:43,296
...against the gates of the Hornburg,
are avenged!

103
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:50,429
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

104
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:53,598
...we shall have peace.

105
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:59,062
Gibbets and crows?

106
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:00,647
Dotard!

107
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:04,943
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

108
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:08,447
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

109
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:11,533
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...

110
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,704
...along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the Five Wizards!

111
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:18,832
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

112
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,376
Thousands more are now at risk.

113
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:23,920
But you could save them, Saruman.

114
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:26,381
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

115
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:29,843
So you have come here for information.

116
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:32,554
I have some for you.

117
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,979
Something festers
in the heart of Middle-earth.

118
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:43,398
Something that you have failed to see.

119
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:49,404
But the Great Eye has seen it.

120
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:54,159
Even now he presses his advantage.

121
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:59,247
His attack will come soon.

122
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,585
You're all going to die.

123
00:14:06,088 --> 00:14:09,341
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

124
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:14,137
You cannot think that this Ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

125
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:20,394
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

126
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:25,399
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

127
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:28,527
...those he professes to love.

128
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:34,116
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

129
00:14:34,282 --> 00:14:37,327
...before you sent him to his doom?

130
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:44,459
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

131
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:46,962
I've heard enough!

132
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:48,964
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

133
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:51,133
No.

134
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,802
Come down, Saruman...

135
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:57,931
- ...and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

136
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,433
I have no use for it!

137
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,110
Saruman...

138
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:14,322
...your staff is broken.

139
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,670
Gríma, you need not follow him.

140
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:32,507
You were not always as you are now.

141
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:35,510
You were once a Man of Rohan.

142
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:36,928
Come down.

143
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:39,806
A Man of Rohan?

144
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:42,976
What is the house of Rohan...

145
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:46,813
...but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

146
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,692
...and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

147
00:15:51,193 --> 00:15:57,657
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.

148
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:02,871
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

149
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:06,917
Gríma...

150
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:09,628
...come down.

151
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:11,380
Be free of him.

152
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:15,550
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

153
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:18,553
Get down, cur!

154
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:21,598
Saruman!

155
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:24,393
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

156
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:27,062
Tell us what you know!

157
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:33,819
You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you
where your doom will be decided.

158
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:37,531
I will not be held prisoner here.

159
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:06,184
Send word to all our allies...

160
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:09,271
...and to every corner of Middle-earth
that still stands free.

161
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:12,941
The enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

162
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:36,089
The filth of Saruman...

163
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:40,093
...is washing away.

164
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,806
Trees will come back to live here.

165
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:47,476
Young trees.

166
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:49,853
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

167
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:01,490
Bless my bark!

168
00:18:01,656 --> 00:18:03,533
Peregrin Took!

169
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,328
I'll take that, my lad.

170
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:08,372
Quickly, now.

171
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:04,136
Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

172
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:06,847
Hail the victorious dead.

173
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,432
Hail!

174
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:21,319
No pauses.

175
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:25,657
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

176
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:27,826
So it's a drinking game?

177
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,080
Last one standing wins.

178
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:38,420
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

179
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:40,005
To victory!

180
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:25,634
I am happy for you.

181
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:28,428
He is an honourable man.

182
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:31,306
You are both honourable men.

183
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:38,480
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

184
00:20:46,655 --> 00:20:48,490
Don't listen to me.

185
00:20:49,324 --> 00:20:50,826
You are young.

186
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:53,328
And tonight is for you.

187
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:09,344
Here, here.

188
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:16,768
It's the Dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

189
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:23,400
I feel something.

190
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:28,030
A slight tingle in my fingers.

191
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:30,323
I think it's affecting me.

192
00:21:32,242 --> 00:21:33,952
What did I say?

193
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:37,456
He can't hold his liquor.

194
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:46,131
Game over.

Thank you! I win!

204
00:22:23,585 --> 00:22:26,088
No news of Frodo?

205
00:22:26,254 --> 00:22:29,758
No word. Nothing.

206
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:32,761
We have time.

207
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:37,557
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

208
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:40,394
Do we know that?

209
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:45,941
What does your heart tell you?

210
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:56,326
That Frodo is alive.

211
00:22:58,495 --> 00:23:00,288
Yes.

212
00:23:02,974 --> 00:23:05,143
Yes, he's alive.

213
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:10,232
Too risky. Too risky.

214
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:11,650
Thieves.

215
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:13,860
They stole it from us.

216
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:17,531
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

217
00:23:19,574 --> 00:23:22,410
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

218
00:23:22,577 --> 00:23:25,121
Mustn't ruin it now.

219
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:27,374
But they knows.

220
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,417
They knows.

221
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:32,212
They suspects us.

222
00:23:33,421 --> 00:23:36,967
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

223
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:40,720
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

224
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:43,765
No. Not.

225
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:48,186
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

226
00:23:48,353 --> 00:23:53,191
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

227
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:55,902
And we will.

228
00:23:56,069 --> 00:24:00,115
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

229
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:06,021
It's ours!

230
00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:08,857
Ours!

231
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:12,861
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

232
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:16,448
Patience! Patience, my love.

233
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:20,994
First we must lead them to her.

234
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,875
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

235
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:29,711
Yes, the stairs. And then?

236
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:32,881
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

237
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:39,471
...until we come to the tunnel.

238
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:42,974
And when they go in...

239
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:45,936
...there's no coming out.

240
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:49,731
She's always hungry.

241
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:54,695
She always needs to feed.

242
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,279
She must eat.

243
00:24:56,446 --> 00:24:58,573
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

244
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,493
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

245
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,745
No.

246
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:08,625
Not very nice at all, my love.

247
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:11,586
She hungers for sweeter meats.

248
00:25:11,753 --> 00:25:13,588
Hobbit meat.

249
00:25:13,755 --> 00:25:18,593
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

250
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,847
...then we will find it.

251
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:26,351
And take it for me!

252
00:25:28,103 --> 00:25:29,521
For us.

253
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:33,025
Yes. We meant "for us."

254
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:36,653
Gollum. Gollum.

255
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:41,324
The precious will be ours...

256
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:45,996
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

257
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,956
You treacherous little toad!

258
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:52,961
No! No! Master!

259
00:25:53,128 --> 00:25:54,755
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

260
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,300
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

261
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:02,637
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

262
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:06,725
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

263
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:08,477
...who hates Sméagol...

264
00:26:08,643 --> 00:26:11,438
...and who makes up nasty lies.

265
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:14,274
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

266
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:15,942
Sam!

267
00:26:16,318 --> 00:26:18,612
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

268
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:23,492
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

269
00:26:23,658 --> 00:26:26,828
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

270
00:26:27,162 --> 00:26:28,497
You don't see it, do you?

271
00:26:28,914 --> 00:26:30,332
He's a villain.

272
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,961
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

273
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:38,673
I need you on my side.

274
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:41,802
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

275
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:46,264
I know, Sam. I know.

276
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:48,809
Trust me.

277
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:51,353
Come, Sméagol.

278
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:00,756
What time is it?

279
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:04,593
Not yet dawn.

280
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:14,561
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

281
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:18,732
...climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

282
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:22,444
I stood upon the brink.

283
00:28:23,362 --> 00:28:26,531
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

284
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,244
A light shone behind me...

285
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,289
...but I could not turn.

286
00:28:34,456 --> 00:28:37,876
I could only stand there, waiting.

287
00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:42,047
Night changes many thoughts.

288
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:44,591
Sleep, Éowyn.

289
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:47,386
Sleep...

290
00:28:50,097 --> 00:28:51,973
...while you can.

291
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:18,417
The stars are veiled.

292
00:29:19,418 --> 00:29:22,921
Something stirs in the east.

293
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:26,717
A sleepless malice.

294
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:31,513
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

295
00:29:44,943 --> 00:29:47,654
What are you doing?

296
00:29:52,284 --> 00:29:53,744
Pippin!

297
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:03,003
Pippin?

298
00:30:15,891 --> 00:30:17,225
Pippin.

299
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:20,562
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

300
00:30:20,729 --> 00:30:21,855
Just one more time.

301
00:30:22,105 --> 00:30:24,191
Put it back.

302
00:30:34,451 --> 00:30:36,244
Pippin.

303
00:30:42,751 --> 00:30:44,252
No!

304
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:50,592
Pippin.

305
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:55,138
He is here.

306
00:30:55,305 --> 00:30:57,599
<i>I see you.</i>

307
00:31:00,602 --> 00:31:02,229
Pippin!

308
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:19,621
Help! Gandalf, help!

309
00:31:21,373 --> 00:31:23,250
Someone help him!

310
00:31:29,631 --> 00:31:30,841
Pippin!

311
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,218
Fool of a Took!

312
00:31:54,322 --> 00:31:56,533
Look at me.

313
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:02,622
Gandalf, forgive me.

314
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:04,666
Look at me.

315
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:06,668
What did you see?

316
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:12,257
A tree.

317
00:32:13,216 --> 00:32:15,093
There was a white tree...

318
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,762
...in a courtyard of stone.

319
00:32:19,556 --> 00:32:20,849
It was dead.

320
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,855
The city was burning.

321
00:32:27,022 --> 00:32:30,400
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

322
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:33,111
I saw...

323
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,866
I saw him.

324
00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:43,121
I could hear his voice in my head.

325
00:32:43,288 --> 00:32:45,707
And what did you tell him?

326
00:32:45,874 --> 00:32:47,709
Speak!

327
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,050
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

328
00:32:55,217 --> 00:32:56,676
He hurt me.

329
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:59,304
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

330
00:33:02,808 --> 00:33:05,268
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

331
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:08,355
A fool...

332
00:33:08,522 --> 00:33:10,816
...but an honest fool he remains.

333
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:14,820
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

334
00:33:15,862 --> 00:33:18,240
We've been strangely fortunate.

335
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:22,285
Pippin saw in the palantír
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

336
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:27,165
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

337
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:31,503
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

338
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,005
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

339
00:33:34,172 --> 00:33:36,299
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

340
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:40,262
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

341
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,347
Sauron fears this.

342
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:46,852
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

343
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,439
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

344
00:33:50,605 --> 00:33:54,109
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

345
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:58,196
If the beacons of Gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

346
00:33:59,114 --> 00:34:01,324
Tell me...

347
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:05,287
...why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

348
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:11,001
What do we owe Gondor?

349
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:14,171
- I will go.
- No!

350
00:34:14,337 --> 00:34:17,507
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

351
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:23,472
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

352
00:34:24,014 --> 00:34:28,477
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

353
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:31,396
Understand this:

354
00:34:31,563 --> 00:34:35,233
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

355
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:38,820
I ride for Minas Tirith...

356
00:34:41,073 --> 00:34:43,742
...and I won't be going alone.

357
00:34:45,494 --> 00:34:49,164
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

358
00:34:50,165 --> 00:34:51,833
Hurry! Hurry!

359
00:34:53,335 --> 00:34:54,753
Where are we going?

360
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,171
Why did you look?

361
00:34:56,338 --> 00:34:59,091
Why do you always have to look?

362
00:34:59,257 --> 00:35:02,344
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

363
00:35:02,803 --> 00:35:04,221
I'm sorry, all right?

364
00:35:06,306 --> 00:35:09,226
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

365
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:11,937
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

366
00:35:12,104 --> 00:35:15,857
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

367
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:19,945
And you...? You're coming with me?

368
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:23,573
Merry?

369
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,033
Come on.

370
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:31,915
How far is Minas Tirith?

371
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:34,710
Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.

372
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:38,380
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

373
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:40,590
Here.

374
00:35:40,757 --> 00:35:42,551
Something for the road.

375
00:35:43,427 --> 00:35:45,387
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

376
00:35:45,554 --> 00:35:49,558
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

377
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:52,227
But... But we'll see each other soon.

378
00:35:55,564 --> 00:35:58,066
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

379
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:02,112
I don't know what's going to happen.

380
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,989
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

381
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:05,615
Show us the meaning of haste.

382
00:36:05,782 --> 00:36:07,701
Merry!

383
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,296
Merry!

384
00:36:29,765 --> 00:36:31,266
He's always followed me...

385
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:33,977
...everywhere I went...

386
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:36,104
...since before we were tweens.

387
00:36:37,272 --> 00:36:41,193
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

388
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,445
...but I was always there to get him out.

389
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:47,783
Now he's gone.

390
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:52,371
Just like Frodo and Sam.

391
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:55,749
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

392
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,584
They're a most hardy folk.

393
00:36:58,126 --> 00:37:01,838
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

394
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:18,605
<i>Take her by the safest road.</i>

395
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:21,274
<i>A ship lies anchored
In the Grey Havens.</i>

396
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:25,320
<i>It waits to carry her across the sea.</i>

397
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:28,865
<i>The last journey of Arwen Undómiel.</i>

398
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:37,559
There is nothing for you here...

399
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,270
...only death.

400
00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:48,862
Lady Arwen...

401
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,698
...we cannot delay.

402
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,410
My lady!

403
00:39:14,805 --> 00:39:17,432
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

404
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,559
You have the gift of foresight.

405
00:39:19,726 --> 00:39:21,520
What did you see?

406
00:39:22,145 --> 00:39:25,482
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

407
00:39:26,024 --> 00:39:28,151
But there is also life.

408
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:34,116
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

409
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:37,285
That future is almost gone.

410
00:39:37,452 --> 00:39:39,454
But it is not lost.

411
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,251
Nothing is certain.

412
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:48,672
Some things are certain.

413
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:55,303
If I leave him now...

414
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,098
...I will regret it forever.

415
00:39:59,182 --> 00:40:01,518
It is time.

416
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:10,569
<i>From the ashes a fire shall be woken,</i>

417
00:40:10,736 --> 00:40:14,156
<i>A light from the shadow shall spring.</i>

418
00:40:14,322 --> 00:40:17,617
<i>Renewed shall be blade that was broken,</i>

419
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,211
<i>The crownless again shall be king.</i>

420
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:34,009
Re-forge the sword.

421
00:41:08,877 --> 00:41:11,588
Your hands are cold.

422
00:41:14,966 --> 00:41:18,095
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

423
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:23,433
This was my choice.

424
00:41:25,268 --> 00:41:27,562
Whether by your will or not...

425
00:41:28,897 --> 00:41:33,193
...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

426
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:23,243
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

427
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,132
Minas Tirith.

428
00:42:37,716 --> 00:42:40,052
City of kings.

429
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:13,210
Make way!

430
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:44,241
It's the tree.

431
00:43:44,408 --> 00:43:46,076
Gandalf. Gandalf.

432
00:43:46,243 --> 00:43:48,495
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

433
00:43:48,662 --> 00:43:50,497
The tree of the king.

434
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:53,333
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

435
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,169
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

436
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,465
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

437
00:44:01,007 --> 00:44:04,803
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

438
00:44:05,262 --> 00:44:08,724
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

439
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,352
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

440
00:44:14,187 --> 00:44:18,066
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

441
00:44:48,221 --> 00:44:54,728
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

442
00:45:00,233 --> 00:45:04,946
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

443
00:45:05,906 --> 00:45:09,284
Perhaps you come to explain this.

444
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:19,461
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

445
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:36,937
Boromir died to save us...

446
00:45:37,104 --> 00:45:38,772
...my kinsman and me.

447
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:42,442
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

448
00:45:47,948 --> 00:45:51,410
I offer you my service, such as it is...

449
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:53,954
...in payment of this debt.

450
00:45:56,123 --> 00:45:59,459
This is my first command to you.

451
00:46:00,168 --> 00:46:03,630
How did you escape
and my son did not...

452
00:46:03,964 --> 00:46:06,299
...so mighty a man as he was?

453
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:10,303
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

454
00:46:10,554 --> 00:46:12,472
...and Boromir was pierced by many.

455
00:46:16,601 --> 00:46:18,311
Get up.

456
00:46:18,478 --> 00:46:23,108
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

457
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:25,318
...but it is not now.

458
00:46:26,028 --> 00:46:28,238
War is coming.

459
00:46:28,572 --> 00:46:32,993
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

460
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,330
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

461
00:46:37,497 --> 00:46:42,377
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

462
00:46:42,544 --> 00:46:47,049
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

463
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:52,179
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

464
00:46:52,345 --> 00:46:55,390
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

465
00:46:57,517 --> 00:47:01,688
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

466
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:04,941
I have seen more than you know.

467
00:47:05,108 --> 00:47:08,320
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

468
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:11,365
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

469
00:47:11,531 --> 00:47:15,243
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.

470
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:21,375
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

471
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:26,380
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

472
00:47:26,546 --> 00:47:31,051
...last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

473
00:47:31,218 --> 00:47:37,057
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

474
00:47:37,224 --> 00:47:41,645
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

475
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:48,610
Come.

476
00:47:56,535 --> 00:47:59,121
All has turned to vain ambition.

477
00:47:59,287 --> 00:48:02,749
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

478
00:48:05,627 --> 00:48:08,422
A thousand years
this city has stood.

479
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:11,925
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

480
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:15,345
And the White Tree,
the tree of the king...

481
00:48:15,512 --> 00:48:17,055
...will never bloom again.

482
00:48:17,222 --> 00:48:20,600
- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.

483
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:23,937
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

484
00:48:24,104 --> 00:48:28,859
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

485
00:48:29,026 --> 00:48:31,945
...before it fell into decay.

486
00:48:32,112 --> 00:48:35,365
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

487
00:48:35,532 --> 00:48:39,828
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

488
00:48:40,037 --> 00:48:41,955
...and counted the old names
of their descent...

489
00:48:42,122 --> 00:48:44,916
...dearer than the names of their sons.

490
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:50,130
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

491
00:48:50,297 --> 00:48:55,635
...or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

492
00:48:55,802 --> 00:48:59,598
And so the people of Gondor
fell into ruin.

493
00:49:00,557 --> 00:49:02,893
The line of kings failed.

494
00:49:03,602 --> 00:49:05,979
The White Tree withered.

495
00:49:06,688 --> 00:49:10,859
The rule of Gondor was given over
to lesser men.

496
00:49:21,578 --> 00:49:22,829
Mordor.

497
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:27,000
Yes, there it lies.

498
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:31,171
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

499
00:49:33,173 --> 00:49:34,841
A storm is coming.

500
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:38,428
This is not the weather of the world.

501
00:49:38,595 --> 00:49:40,806
This is a device of Sauron's making.

502
00:49:40,972 --> 00:49:44,726
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

503
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,771
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

504
00:49:47,938 --> 00:49:49,773
...so he covers the face of the sun...

505
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,694
...to ease their passage
along the road to war.

506
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,155
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

507
00:49:57,864 --> 00:49:59,574
...it will begin.

508
00:50:01,243 --> 00:50:02,828
Well...

509
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:04,538
...Minas Tirith...

510
00:50:06,456 --> 00:50:07,874
...very impressive.

511
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:10,669
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

512
00:50:10,836 --> 00:50:13,046
There's no leaving this city.

513
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:18,593
Help must come to us.

514
00:50:20,095 --> 00:50:22,764
It must be getting near teatime.

515
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:26,643
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

516
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:30,397
We're not in decent places.

517
00:50:35,944 --> 00:50:37,195
Mr. Frodo?

518
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,450
What is it?

519
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:46,288
It's just a feeling.

520
00:50:48,707 --> 00:50:50,876
I don't think I'll be coming back.

521
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,924
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

522
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:00,427
That's just morbid thinking.

523
00:51:00,886 --> 00:51:03,347
We're going there and back again...

524
00:51:03,513 --> 00:51:05,807
...just like Mr. Bilbo.

525
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:08,894
You'll see.

526
00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:20,697
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

527
00:51:25,077 --> 00:51:29,122
Long ago, when there was a king.

528
00:51:49,768 --> 00:51:52,604
Mr. Frodo, look.

529
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:56,983
The king has got a crown again.

530
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:12,374
Come on, Hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

531
00:52:29,224 --> 00:52:33,270
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

532
00:52:33,437 --> 00:52:37,691
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

533
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:41,778
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

534
00:52:41,945 --> 00:52:45,323
You'll have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

535
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:51,872
Ridiculous Hobbit.

536
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,250
Guard of the Citadel.

537
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,595
Thank you.

538
00:53:15,979 --> 00:53:18,231
There's no more stars.

539
00:53:18,732 --> 00:53:19,941
Is it time?

540
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:22,861
Yes.

541
00:53:25,489 --> 00:53:27,157
It's so quiet.

542
00:53:28,158 --> 00:53:32,412
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

543
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,458
I don't want to be in a battle...

544
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:42,255
...but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

545
00:53:45,801 --> 00:53:49,429
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

546
00:53:50,764 --> 00:53:53,892
There never was much hope.

547
00:53:55,852 --> 00:53:57,604
Just a fool's hope.

548
00:54:03,485 --> 00:54:06,279
Our enemy is ready.

549
00:54:06,446 --> 00:54:09,116
His full strength's gathered.

550
00:54:09,282 --> 00:54:12,786
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

551
00:54:12,953 --> 00:54:15,997
<i>Legions of Haradrim from the south...</i>

552
00:54:16,164 --> 00:54:18,875
<i>...mercenaries from the coast.</i>

553
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:21,628
<i>All will answer Mordor's call.</i>

554
00:54:21,795 --> 00:54:23,338
Come on.

555
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:27,801
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

556
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:31,346
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

557
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:36,643
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

558
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:40,480
...the last defense of this city
will be gone.

559
00:54:40,647 --> 00:54:44,693
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

560
00:54:50,574 --> 00:54:52,159
Gandalf?

561
00:54:55,871 --> 00:54:59,541
<i>Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...</i>

562
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,837
<i>...the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.</i>

563
00:55:04,004 --> 00:55:09,176
<i>The one they say no living man can kill.</i>

564
00:55:10,177 --> 00:55:12,346
The Witch King of Angmar.

565
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:15,807
You've met him before.

566
00:55:16,475 --> 00:55:19,061
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

567
00:55:25,609 --> 00:55:28,320
He is the lord of the Nazgûl...

568
00:55:28,779 --> 00:55:31,239
<i>...the greatest of the Nine.</i>

569
00:55:31,406 --> 00:55:35,035
<i>Minas Morgul is his lair.</i>

570
00:55:38,497 --> 00:55:42,042
The Dead City.

571
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:47,422
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

572
00:55:54,638 --> 00:55:56,807
Quick. Quick.

573
00:55:56,973 --> 00:56:00,977
They will see. They will see.

574
00:56:10,237 --> 00:56:15,534
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

575
00:56:15,701 --> 00:56:19,579
The way into Mordor.

576
00:56:19,746 --> 00:56:24,084
The secret stair.

577
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:26,878
Climb.

578
00:56:47,149 --> 00:56:49,901
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

579
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,617
- What's it doing?
- No.

580
00:56:57,784 --> 00:57:00,871
- They're calling me.
- No.

581
00:57:30,525 --> 00:57:33,487
Hide! Hide!

582
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,866
I can feel his blade.

583
00:58:31,545 --> 00:58:33,672
We come to it at last.

584
00:58:35,507 --> 00:58:38,385
The great battle of our time.

585
00:59:17,549 --> 00:59:20,802
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

586
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:33,690
The board is set.

587
00:59:33,857 --> 00:59:36,401
The pieces are moving.

588
00:59:38,945 --> 00:59:41,615
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

589
00:59:41,782 --> 00:59:44,451
And then it's into the tunnel.

590
00:59:44,618 --> 00:59:47,829
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

591
00:59:48,372 --> 00:59:51,124
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

592
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:54,211
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

593
00:59:54,378 --> 00:59:55,962
One sniff something's not right...

594
00:59:56,129 --> 00:59:59,299
...one hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

595
00:59:59,508 --> 01:00:02,177
No more slinker. No more stinker.

596
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:05,138
You're gone. Got it?

597
01:00:06,014 --> 01:00:08,016
I'm watching you.

598
01:00:13,355 --> 01:00:15,357
What was that about?

599
01:00:15,524 --> 01:00:17,943
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

600
01:00:24,574 --> 01:00:27,452
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

601
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:32,207
Another opportunity for one
of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

602
01:00:37,045 --> 01:00:38,630
You must not fail me.

603
01:01:12,873 --> 01:01:15,959
It's been very quiet across the river.

604
01:01:16,126 --> 01:01:18,462
The Orcs are lying low.

605
01:01:18,628 --> 01:01:20,630
The garrison may have moved out.

606
01:01:21,757 --> 01:01:24,468
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

607
01:01:24,634 --> 01:01:27,929
If the Orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

608
01:01:53,246 --> 01:01:54,456
Quiet.

609
01:01:58,543 --> 01:02:00,504
We need 10 more.

610
01:02:21,817 --> 01:02:23,360
Kill him!

611
01:02:40,669 --> 01:02:43,088
They're not coming from the north.

612
01:02:44,506 --> 01:02:48,844
To the river. Quick. Quick.
Go. Come on.

613
01:02:52,305 --> 01:02:53,890
Faster.

614
01:03:07,029 --> 01:03:09,406
Draw swords.

615
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,546
Hold! Hold them!

616
01:05:26,835 --> 01:05:28,712
What?

617
01:05:41,266 --> 01:05:42,684
Amon Dîn.

618
01:05:48,482 --> 01:05:51,526
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.

619
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:58,992
Hope is kindled.

620
01:07:31,376 --> 01:07:35,756
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

621
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:38,592
Gondor calls for aid.

622
01:07:49,102 --> 01:07:52,022
And Rohan will answer.

623
01:07:52,439 --> 01:07:55,233
Muster the Rohirrim.

624
01:08:10,332 --> 01:08:12,292
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

625
01:08:12,459 --> 01:08:16,838
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

626
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:22,302
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

627
01:08:23,261 --> 01:08:24,596
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

628
01:08:24,763 --> 01:08:26,098
- Gamling.
- My lord.

629
01:08:26,264 --> 01:08:27,849
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

630
01:08:28,016 --> 01:08:30,143
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

631
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:31,895
I will.

632
01:08:35,982 --> 01:08:39,152
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

633
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:43,240
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

634
01:08:49,788 --> 01:08:51,707
The men have found their captain.

635
01:08:51,873 --> 01:08:55,210
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

636
01:08:55,377 --> 01:08:56,962
You have given us hope.

637
01:09:00,173 --> 01:09:02,134
Excuse me.

638
01:09:03,468 --> 01:09:04,970
I have a sword.

639
01:09:05,262 --> 01:09:06,638
Please accept it.

640
01:09:07,764 --> 01:09:12,269
I offer you my service, Théoden King.

641
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:17,774
And gladly I accept it.

642
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:22,946
You shall be Meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

643
01:09:27,826 --> 01:09:29,036
Horse-Men.

644
01:09:29,703 --> 01:09:35,333
I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

645
01:09:35,709 --> 01:09:38,670
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

646
01:09:38,837 --> 01:09:42,257
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

647
01:10:00,734 --> 01:10:04,196
<i>So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...</i>

648
01:10:04,363 --> 01:10:08,241
<i>...the doom of our time will be decided.</i>

649
01:10:10,827 --> 01:10:16,375
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

650
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:20,087
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land!

651
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:05,132
Faramir!

652
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:15,142
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

653
01:11:15,726 --> 01:11:18,812
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

654
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:29,823
Nazgûl.

655
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,661
Take cover!

656
01:11:34,828 --> 01:11:37,372
Nazgûl!

657
01:11:37,539 --> 01:11:41,209
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

658
01:11:47,799 --> 01:11:49,676
Fall back!

659
01:11:56,725 --> 01:12:01,313
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

660
01:12:25,545 --> 01:12:29,883
The age of Men is over.

661
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:35,681
The time of the Orc has come.

662
01:12:38,058 --> 01:12:40,394
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgûl.

663
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,398
Take cover, my lord!

664
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:46,024
It's coming!

665
01:12:51,571 --> 01:12:54,950
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

666
01:13:34,906 --> 01:13:36,283
Pull!

667
01:13:54,009 --> 01:13:56,428
Mithrandir.

668
01:13:56,595 --> 01:13:58,347
They broke through our defenses.

669
01:13:58,513 --> 01:14:00,724
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

670
01:14:01,808 --> 01:14:05,979
- Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
- It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

671
01:14:06,146 --> 01:14:10,692
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

672
01:14:14,071 --> 01:14:16,490
Faramir?

673
01:14:18,408 --> 01:14:22,245
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

674
01:14:22,412 --> 01:14:24,623
No.

675
01:14:25,957 --> 01:14:27,501
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

676
01:14:28,377 --> 01:14:31,797
- Where? When?
- In Ithilien.

677
01:14:31,963 --> 01:14:34,049
Not two days ago.

678
01:14:34,508 --> 01:14:38,970
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

679
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,307
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

680
01:14:44,518 --> 01:14:46,895
What does that mean?

681
01:14:47,062 --> 01:14:51,983
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

682
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:54,194
Tell me all you know.

683
01:14:55,362 --> 01:14:58,782
This is how you would serve your city?

684
01:14:58,949 --> 01:15:02,244
You would risk its utter ruin?

685
01:15:03,286 --> 01:15:04,871
I did what I judged to be right.

686
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:08,583
What you judged to be right.

687
01:15:09,209 --> 01:15:15,090
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

688
01:15:19,052 --> 01:15:23,890
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

689
01:15:25,517 --> 01:15:27,060
Hidden.

690
01:15:27,477 --> 01:15:30,230
Dark and deep in the vaults...

691
01:15:30,397 --> 01:15:32,566
...not to be used.

692
01:15:36,737 --> 01:15:41,616
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

693
01:15:42,075 --> 01:15:44,119
I would not use the Ring.

694
01:15:44,286 --> 01:15:47,372
Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

695
01:15:47,706 --> 01:15:52,544
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

696
01:15:52,711 --> 01:15:54,963
...as a king of old.

697
01:15:56,757 --> 01:16:00,510
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

698
01:16:00,927 --> 01:16:03,388
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

699
01:16:03,597 --> 01:16:06,141
Boromir would not
have brought the Ring.

700
01:16:06,558 --> 01:16:09,686
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

701
01:16:09,853 --> 01:16:12,446
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

702
01:16:13,982 --> 01:16:16,151
And when he returned...

703
01:16:17,277 --> 01:16:18,945
...you would not have known your son.

704
01:16:19,112 --> 01:16:21,656
Boromir was loyal to me!

705
01:16:21,823 --> 01:16:24,409
Not some wizard's pupil!

706
01:16:32,542 --> 01:16:33,877
Father?

707
01:16:46,556 --> 01:16:48,475
My son.

708
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:16,086
Leave me.

709
01:17:49,661 --> 01:17:52,205
Careful, master. Careful.

710
01:17:52,539 --> 01:17:55,459
Very far to fall.

711
01:17:57,961 --> 01:18:01,882
Very dangerous are the stairs.

712
01:18:04,551 --> 01:18:07,095
Come, master.

713
01:18:12,893 --> 01:18:16,063
Come to Sméagol.

714
01:18:22,402 --> 01:18:23,904
Mr. Frodo.

715
01:18:24,905 --> 01:18:26,448
Get back, you!

716
01:18:26,615 --> 01:18:28,825
Don't touch him!

717
01:18:32,954 --> 01:18:35,791
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

718
01:18:35,957 --> 01:18:39,670
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

719
01:18:39,836 --> 01:18:42,214
Master?

720
01:18:43,006 --> 01:18:46,468
Master carries heavy burden.

721
01:18:46,635 --> 01:18:52,057
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

722
01:18:52,224 --> 01:18:55,477
Fat one cannot know.

723
01:18:57,521 --> 01:19:00,273
Sméagol look after master.

724
01:19:01,483 --> 01:19:03,694
He wants it.

725
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:08,407
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

726
01:19:08,573 --> 01:19:14,037
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

727
01:19:14,204 --> 01:19:18,083
The fat one will take it from you.

728
01:19:25,298 --> 01:19:29,636
Send forth all legions.

729
01:19:29,803 --> 01:19:33,849
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

730
01:19:34,558 --> 01:19:37,686
Slay them all.

731
01:19:39,354 --> 01:19:45,152
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

732
01:19:48,488 --> 01:19:50,907
Where are Théoden's riders?

733
01:19:51,074 --> 01:19:53,660
Will Rohan's army come?

734
01:19:53,827 --> 01:19:56,079
Mithrandir.

735
01:19:57,122 --> 01:20:01,001
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

736
01:20:05,797 --> 01:20:08,508
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

737
01:20:10,594 --> 01:20:16,308
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

738
01:20:16,475 --> 01:20:17,976
It was well-done.

739
01:20:21,146 --> 01:20:25,192
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

740
01:20:25,942 --> 01:20:28,487
You are to join the tower guard.

741
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:32,032
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

742
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:34,659
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

743
01:20:34,826 --> 01:20:36,370
A very foolish one...

744
01:20:36,536 --> 01:20:40,791
...who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

745
01:20:40,957 --> 01:20:43,710
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

746
01:20:43,877 --> 01:20:45,671
My father had it made for me.

747
01:20:46,713 --> 01:20:48,048
Well...

748
01:20:48,215 --> 01:20:50,217
...I'm taller than you were then.

749
01:20:50,384 --> 01:20:53,720
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

750
01:20:56,682 --> 01:20:58,725
Never fitted me either.

751
01:20:58,892 --> 01:21:01,728
Boromir was always the soldier.

752
01:21:04,731 --> 01:21:07,150
They were so alike, he and my father.

753
01:21:09,236 --> 01:21:10,862
Proud.

754
01:21:11,029 --> 01:21:12,239
Stubborn even.

755
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:15,492
But strong.

756
01:21:16,993 --> 01:21:20,163
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

757
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:23,250
And one day your father will see it.

758
01:21:27,421 --> 01:21:31,216
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

759
01:21:31,383 --> 01:21:32,884
...in peace or war...

760
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:35,971
...in living or dying...

761
01:21:37,347 --> 01:21:38,598
...from...

762
01:21:41,268 --> 01:21:44,062
From this hour henceforth...

763
01:21:44,229 --> 01:21:46,148
...until my lord release me...

764
01:21:47,649 --> 01:21:49,860
...or death take me.

765
01:21:50,444 --> 01:21:52,946
And I shall not forget it...

766
01:21:53,113 --> 01:21:56,491
...nor fail to reward
that which is given.

767
01:22:04,082 --> 01:22:06,376
Fealty with love.

768
01:22:07,461 --> 01:22:09,129
Valour with honour.

769
01:22:10,714 --> 01:22:14,051
Disloyalty with vengeance.

770
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:26,772
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

771
01:22:26,938 --> 01:22:29,691
...defenses that your brother
long held intact.

772
01:22:29,858 --> 01:22:32,361
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

773
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:35,322
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

774
01:22:35,489 --> 01:22:37,157
Osgiliath must be retaken.

775
01:22:37,324 --> 01:22:39,368
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

776
01:22:40,035 --> 01:22:42,829
Much must be risked in war.

777
01:22:45,457 --> 01:22:49,419
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

778
01:22:55,634 --> 01:22:58,887
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

779
01:22:59,846 --> 01:23:02,683
...that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

780
01:23:06,103 --> 01:23:07,854
Yes.

781
01:23:08,522 --> 01:23:10,732
I wish that.

782
01:23:19,116 --> 01:23:21,618
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

783
01:23:23,453 --> 01:23:26,373
...I will do what I can
in his stead.

784
01:23:34,548 --> 01:23:39,011
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

785
01:23:41,096 --> 01:23:44,725
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

786
01:25:08,016 --> 01:25:10,352
What are you up to?

787
01:25:10,519 --> 01:25:11,770
Sneaking off, are we?

788
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:14,314
Sneaking?

789
01:25:15,315 --> 01:25:17,484
Sneaking?

790
01:25:18,902 --> 01:25:22,072
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

791
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:27,327
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

792
01:25:27,494 --> 01:25:29,663
...and they say "sneak."

793
01:25:30,288 --> 01:25:32,874
Sneak?

794
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:36,211
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

795
01:25:36,378 --> 01:25:39,006
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

796
01:25:40,257 --> 01:25:42,467
You just startled me is all.

797
01:25:42,968 --> 01:25:44,803
What were you doing?

798
01:25:46,430 --> 01:25:48,557
Sneaking.

799
01:25:48,932 --> 01:25:52,019
Fine. Have it your own way.

800
01:25:54,271 --> 01:25:56,773
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

801
01:25:57,149 --> 01:25:59,109
We have to be moving on.

802
01:26:04,281 --> 01:26:05,866
It's dark still.

803
01:26:06,033 --> 01:26:08,243
It's always dark here.

804
01:26:12,497 --> 01:26:14,416
It's gone!

805
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:18,503
- The Elven bread.
- What?

806
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:20,130
That's all we have left.

807
01:26:24,217 --> 01:26:26,720
He took it. He must have!

808
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:30,474
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

809
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:33,560
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

810
01:26:33,727 --> 01:26:36,897
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

811
01:26:37,064 --> 01:26:38,607
He doesn't eat it.

812
01:26:39,608 --> 01:26:41,943
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

813
01:26:42,986 --> 01:26:44,821
What's this?

814
01:26:47,491 --> 01:26:50,827
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

815
01:26:51,536 --> 01:26:53,205
He took it.

816
01:26:54,039 --> 01:26:58,251
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

817
01:26:58,418 --> 01:27:00,212
That's a filthy lie!

818
01:27:00,379 --> 01:27:02,589
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

819
01:27:02,756 --> 01:27:04,007
- Sam!
- Call me...

820
01:27:04,174 --> 01:27:05,425
Stop it!

821
01:27:06,426 --> 01:27:07,636
Sam!

822
01:27:08,929 --> 01:27:12,557
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

823
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:19,147
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

824
01:27:19,314 --> 01:27:21,441
Here, just...
Let's just rest a bit.

825
01:27:21,608 --> 01:27:23,694
- I'm all right.
- No.

826
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:26,947
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

827
01:27:27,114 --> 01:27:29,241
It's that Gollum.

828
01:27:29,408 --> 01:27:31,118
It's this place.

829
01:27:31,284 --> 01:27:33,870
It's that thing around your neck.

830
01:27:37,374 --> 01:27:38,667
I could help a bit.

831
01:27:38,834 --> 01:27:41,503
I could carry it for a while.

832
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:43,422
Carry it for a while.

833
01:27:43,588 --> 01:27:44,959
I could carry it... I could carry it.

834
01:27:45,465 --> 01:27:50,929
Share the load... Share the load...
the load... the load.

835
01:27:51,096 --> 01:27:52,305
Get away!

836
01:27:52,472 --> 01:27:54,057
I don't want to keep it.

837
01:27:57,644 --> 01:27:59,646
I just want to help.

838
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:04,317
See? See?

839
01:28:04,484 --> 01:28:07,904
He wants it for himself.

840
01:28:08,071 --> 01:28:09,781
Shut up, you!

841
01:28:10,323 --> 01:28:12,159
Go away!
Get out of here!

842
01:28:12,325 --> 01:28:14,161
No, Sam.

843
01:28:14,327 --> 01:28:15,579
It's you.

844
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:21,501
I'm sorry, Sam.

845
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:24,546
But he's a liar.

846
01:28:24,713 --> 01:28:27,382
He's poisoned you against me.

847
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,719
You can't help me anymore.

848
01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:34,556
You don't mean that.

849
01:28:37,059 --> 01:28:38,852
Go home.

850
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:00,684
Faramir!

851
01:30:00,851 --> 01:30:02,769
Faramir!

852
01:30:04,271 --> 01:30:06,314
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

853
01:30:07,482 --> 01:30:09,526
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

854
01:30:10,277 --> 01:30:12,612
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

855
01:30:13,238 --> 01:30:16,158
This is the city of the Men of Nûmenor.

856
01:30:16,783 --> 01:30:19,578
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

857
01:30:19,745 --> 01:30:22,956
...her memory, her wisdom.

858
01:30:25,334 --> 01:30:28,754
Your father loves you, Faramir.

859
01:30:29,463 --> 01:30:32,466
He will remember it
before the end.

860
01:31:42,077 --> 01:31:43,620
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

861
01:31:46,498 --> 01:31:48,000
Well...

862
01:31:48,542 --> 01:31:50,168
...yes.

863
01:31:50,877 --> 01:31:54,631
At least, well enough
for my own people.

864
01:31:56,258 --> 01:31:58,677
But we have no songs
for great halls...

865
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:00,971
...and evil times.

866
01:32:01,805 --> 01:32:04,975
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

867
01:32:07,769 --> 01:32:09,187
Come, sing me a song.

868

March! March!

880
01:33:52,249 --> 01:33:57,462
March! March! March!

881
01:34:00,924 --> 01:34:03,260
Make way for the king.

882
01:34:04,761 --> 01:34:06,763
Make way.

883
01:34:09,224 --> 01:34:11,268
The king is here.

884
01:34:13,228 --> 01:34:14,855
My lord.

885
01:34:16,106 --> 01:34:18,066
Hail to you, sire.

886
01:34:18,525 --> 01:34:19,735
Grimbold, how many?

887
01:34:19,901 --> 01:34:22,362
I bring 500 men from the Westfold,
my lord.

888
01:34:23,321 --> 01:34:25,991
We have 300 more from Fenmarch,
Théoden King.

889
01:34:27,117 --> 01:34:31,079
- Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
- None have come, my lord.

890
01:34:48,138 --> 01:34:50,265
Six thousand spears.

891
01:34:51,308 --> 01:34:53,310
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

892
01:34:53,602 --> 01:34:56,980
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

893
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:01,485
More will come.

894
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:04,821
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

895
01:35:04,988 --> 01:35:07,574
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

896
01:35:27,052 --> 01:35:29,388
The horses are restless...

897
01:35:29,554 --> 01:35:31,056
...and the men are quiet.

898
01:35:31,515 --> 01:35:34,643
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

899
01:35:37,104 --> 01:35:38,980
That road there...

900
01:35:39,898 --> 01:35:41,983
...where does that lead?

901
01:35:42,734 --> 01:35:46,571
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

902
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,283
None who venture there ever return.

903
01:35:51,493 --> 01:35:53,370
That mountain is evil.

904
01:36:16,309 --> 01:36:18,145
Aragorn.

905
01:36:18,895 --> 01:36:20,814
Let's find some food.

906
01:36:37,289 --> 01:36:38,707
There.

907
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:42,669
A true esquire of Rohan.

908
01:36:46,298 --> 01:36:48,300
I'm ready.

909
01:36:49,885 --> 01:36:51,178
Sorry.

910
01:36:51,345 --> 01:36:53,597
It isn't all that dangerous.

911
01:36:54,097 --> 01:36:56,433
It's not even sharp.

912
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:00,520
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many Orcs with a blunt blade.

913
01:37:00,687 --> 01:37:02,189
Come on.

914
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:08,862
To the smithy. Go!

915
01:37:10,322 --> 01:37:12,866
You should not encourage him.

916
01:37:13,033 --> 01:37:15,494
You should not doubt him.

917
01:37:15,661 --> 01:37:18,955
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

918
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:23,251
Why should Merry be left behind?

919
01:37:23,418 --> 01:37:26,046
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

920
01:37:28,215 --> 01:37:31,385
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

921
01:37:34,638 --> 01:37:37,641
You know as little of war
as that Hobbit.

922
01:37:38,892 --> 01:37:40,977
When the fear takes him...

923
01:37:41,144 --> 01:37:46,191
...and the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold...

924
01:37:46,566 --> 01:37:48,735
...do you think he would stand and fight?

925
01:37:51,279 --> 01:37:52,906
He would flee.

926
01:37:53,073 --> 01:37:55,117
And he would be right to do so.

927
01:37:57,327 --> 01:38:01,289
War is the province of Men, Éowyn.

928
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:40,662
<i>I choose a mortal life.</i>

929
01:38:43,582 --> 01:38:46,460
I wish I could've seen him...

930
01:38:47,586 --> 01:38:50,297
...one last time.

931
01:39:01,475 --> 01:39:02,893
Sir?

932
01:39:04,728 --> 01:39:07,314
King Théoden awaits you, my lord.

933
01:39:28,085 --> 01:39:30,045
I take my leave.

934
01:39:44,685 --> 01:39:45,936
My lord Elrond.

935
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:50,023
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

936
01:39:53,110 --> 01:39:55,112
Arwen is dying.

937
01:39:59,908 --> 01:40:03,954
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

938
01:40:04,705 --> 01:40:08,083
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

939
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:12,254
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

940
01:40:12,421 --> 01:40:16,174
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

941
01:40:16,925 --> 01:40:19,511
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

942
01:40:19,886 --> 01:40:21,555
The end has come.

943
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:24,558
It will not be our end, but his.

944
01:40:25,308 --> 01:40:28,895
You ride to war, but not to victory.

945
01:40:29,896 --> 01:40:33,567
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

946
01:40:33,734 --> 01:40:38,155
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

947
01:40:38,613 --> 01:40:42,034
<i>A fleet of Corsair ships sails
from the south.</i>

948
01:40:42,659 --> 01:40:44,745
They'll be in the city in two days.

949
01:40:45,245 --> 01:40:48,081
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

950
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:50,917
You need more men.

951
01:40:51,293 --> 01:40:53,045
There are none.

952
01:40:54,796 --> 01:40:58,717
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

953
01:41:07,726 --> 01:41:09,895
Murderers...

954
01:41:10,062 --> 01:41:11,480
...traitors.

955
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:16,109
You would call upon them to fight?

956
01:41:16,276 --> 01:41:17,861
They believe in nothing.

957
01:41:18,028 --> 01:41:20,155
They answer to no one.

958
01:41:20,322 --> 01:41:23,408
They will answer
to the king of Gondor.

959
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:35,671
Andûril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

960
01:41:49,976 --> 01:41:54,398
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

961
01:42:08,453 --> 01:42:13,208
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

962
01:42:13,375 --> 01:42:15,794
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

963
01:42:15,961 --> 01:42:19,840
...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

964
01:42:21,675 --> 01:42:23,844
Put aside the Ranger.

965
01:42:24,011 --> 01:42:27,347
Become who you were born to be.

966
01:42:27,514 --> 01:42:29,516
Take the Dimholt road.

967
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:36,314
I give hope to Men.

968
01:42:39,568 --> 01:42:43,697
I keep none for myself.

969
01:42:55,542 --> 01:42:57,210
Why are you doing this?

970
01:42:57,669 --> 01:43:00,881
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

971
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:05,385
You cannot abandon the men.

972
01:43:06,678 --> 01:43:08,263
Éowyn...

973
01:43:08,430 --> 01:43:10,640
We need you here.

974
01:43:11,767 --> 01:43:13,643
Why have you come?

975
01:43:15,312 --> 01:43:17,272
Do you not know?

976
01:43:26,573 --> 01:43:29,576
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

977
01:43:33,497 --> 01:43:35,916
I cannot give you what you seek.

978
01:43:49,429 --> 01:43:53,350
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

979
01:44:12,494 --> 01:44:14,788
Just where do you think
you're off to?

980
01:44:14,955 --> 01:44:16,289
Not this time.

981
01:44:16,456 --> 01:44:18,667
This time you must stay, Gimli.

982
01:44:21,378 --> 01:44:24,214
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

983
01:44:24,381 --> 01:44:28,051
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

984
01:44:50,365 --> 01:44:52,534
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

985
01:44:52,868 --> 01:44:54,745
Where's he going?

986
01:44:57,331 --> 01:44:59,374
I don't understand.

987
01:45:03,795 --> 01:45:05,589
Lord Aragorn!

988
01:45:06,006 --> 01:45:08,717
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

989
01:45:09,926 --> 01:45:12,012
He leaves because there is no hope.

990
01:45:12,679 --> 01:45:14,806
He leaves because he must.

991
01:45:14,973 --> 01:45:16,683
Too few have come.

992
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:19,019
We cannot defeat
the armies of Mordor.

993
01:45:21,521 --> 01:45:23,190
No...

994
01:45:23,607 --> 01:45:24,858
...we cannot.

995
01:45:27,736 --> 01:45:31,531
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

996
01:45:45,962 --> 01:45:47,714
I have left instruction.

997
01:45:50,384 --> 01:45:53,637
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

998
01:46:00,227 --> 01:46:02,479
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

999
01:46:03,730 --> 01:46:06,566
Long may you defend Edoras...

1000
01:46:06,733 --> 01:46:09,069
...if the battle goes ill.

1001
01:46:10,153 --> 01:46:13,573
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

1002
01:46:15,784 --> 01:46:17,744
Duty?

1003
01:46:19,913 --> 01:46:21,248
No.

1004
01:46:29,548 --> 01:46:31,675
I would have you smile again...

1005
01:46:35,095 --> 01:46:40,100
...not grieve for those
whose time has come.

1006
01:46:44,938 --> 01:46:48,442
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

1007
01:46:52,779 --> 01:46:55,532
...and no more despair.

1008
01:47:01,747 --> 01:47:05,459
What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

1009
01:47:05,625 --> 01:47:07,461
One that is cursed.

1010
01:47:09,421 --> 01:47:11,965
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains
swore an oath...

1011
01:47:12,382 --> 01:47:15,135
...to the last king of Gondor...

1012
01:47:15,719 --> 01:47:17,304
...to come to his aid...

1013
01:47:17,471 --> 01:47:19,181
...to fight.

1014
01:47:19,681 --> 01:47:21,850
But when the time came...

1015
01:47:22,476 --> 01:47:25,103
...when Gondor's need was dire...

1016
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:27,147
...they fled...

1017
01:47:27,314 --> 01:47:30,692
...vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

1018
01:47:31,735 --> 01:47:34,071
And so Isildur cursed them...

1019
01:47:35,614 --> 01:47:39,493
...never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

1020
01:47:43,789 --> 01:47:46,958
Who shall call them
from the grey twilight?

1021
01:47:47,417 --> 01:47:49,670
The forgotten people.

1022
01:47:49,836 --> 01:47:52,339
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

1023
01:47:52,798 --> 01:47:54,675
From the north shall he come.

1024
01:47:55,175 --> 01:47:56,843
Need shall drive him.

1025
01:47:57,928 --> 01:48:01,431
He shall pass the door
to the Paths of the Dead.

1026
01:48:19,908 --> 01:48:23,203
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

1027
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,711
The way is shut.

1028
01:48:31,461 --> 01:48:33,422
It was made by those
who are dead.

1029
01:48:34,047 --> 01:48:36,299
And the Dead keep it.

1030
01:48:36,842 --> 01:48:38,385
The way is shut.

1031
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:51,231
Brego!

1032
01:48:54,735 --> 01:48:57,446
I do not fear death.

1033
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:12,169
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1034
01:49:12,336 --> 01:49:17,007
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

1035
01:49:17,174 --> 01:49:18,508
Oh.

1036
01:49:18,675 --> 01:49:21,511
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1037
01:49:36,526 --> 01:49:38,779
We must ride light and swift.

1038
01:49:38,945 --> 01:49:40,697
It is a long road ahead.

1039
01:49:40,864 --> 01:49:43,950
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

1040
01:49:49,456 --> 01:49:52,459
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.

1041
01:49:52,793 --> 01:49:54,795
All my friends have gone to battle.

1042
01:49:54,961 --> 01:49:56,838
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1043
01:49:57,005 --> 01:49:59,132
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1044
01:49:59,299 --> 01:50:01,677
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

1045
01:50:02,678 --> 01:50:04,805
I want to fight.

1046
01:50:05,305 --> 01:50:07,307
I will say no more.

1047
01:50:24,116 --> 01:50:26,076
Ride with me.

1048
01:50:27,536 --> 01:50:28,954
My lady.

1049
01:50:29,121 --> 01:50:31,498
Form up! Move out!

1050
01:50:31,665 --> 01:50:34,876
Form up! Move out!

1051
01:50:37,963 --> 01:50:39,172
Ride!

1052
01:50:39,339 --> 01:50:42,300
Ride now to Gondor!

1053
01:51:23,925 --> 01:51:25,677
What is it?

1054
01:51:25,844 --> 01:51:27,387
What do you see?

1055
01:51:27,637 --> 01:51:29,765
I see shapes of men.

1056
01:51:32,434 --> 01:51:33,810
And of horses.

1057
01:51:34,561 --> 01:51:35,771
Where?

1058
01:51:35,937 --> 01:51:38,899
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1059
01:51:41,318 --> 01:51:43,528
Spears rise...

1060
01:51:44,154 --> 01:51:47,616
...like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

1061
01:51:48,867 --> 01:51:51,036
The Dead are following.

1062
01:51:52,245 --> 01:51:53,747
They have been summoned.

1063
01:51:54,414 --> 01:51:56,249
The Dead?

1064
01:51:56,625 --> 01:51:58,335
Summoned?

1065
01:51:58,752 --> 01:52:00,629
I knew that.

1066
01:52:03,965 --> 01:52:05,717
Very good.

1067
01:52:06,426 --> 01:52:08,512
Very good! Legolas!

1068
01:52:46,466 --> 01:52:47,884
Do not look down.

1069
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:45,609
<i>Who enters my domain?</i>

1070
01:53:49,363 --> 01:53:51,573
One who will have your allegiance.

1071
01:53:54,534 --> 01:53:59,873
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1072
01:54:00,207 --> 01:54:02,876
You will suffer me.

1073
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,778
The way is shut.

1074
01:54:30,946 --> 01:54:35,409
It was made by those who are dead.

1075
01:54:35,784 --> 01:54:39,955
And the Dead keep it.

1076
01:54:49,089 --> 01:54:52,175
The way is shut.

1077
01:54:53,927 --> 01:54:56,555
Now you must die.

1078
01:55:00,434 --> 01:55:03,270
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1079
01:55:03,603 --> 01:55:08,567
None but the king of Gondor
may command me.

1080
01:55:14,156 --> 01:55:16,325
That line was broken.

1081
01:55:18,952 --> 01:55:21,163
It has been remade.

1082
01:55:29,087 --> 01:55:30,630
Fight for us...

1083
01:55:30,797 --> 01:55:33,342
...and regain your honour.

1084
01:55:37,512 --> 01:55:38,847
What say you?

1085
01:55:51,068 --> 01:55:52,611
What say you?

1086
01:55:53,362 --> 01:55:55,155
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1087
01:55:55,322 --> 01:55:58,492
They had no honour in life,
they have none now in death.

1088
01:55:58,992 --> 01:56:01,495
I am Isildur's heir.

1089
01:56:02,037 --> 01:56:03,997
Fight for me...

1090
01:56:04,581 --> 01:56:08,168
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1091
01:56:12,089 --> 01:56:14,049
What say you?

1092
01:56:21,973 --> 01:56:24,184
You have my word!

1093
01:56:24,476 --> 01:56:28,480
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

1094
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:31,441
What say you?!

1095
01:56:34,736 --> 01:56:37,698
Stand, you traitors!

1096
01:57:04,641 --> 01:57:05,684
Out!

1097
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:28,623
Legolas!

1098
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:30,959
Run!

1099
01:58:37,275 --> 01:58:39,361
We fight.

1100
01:58:50,005 --> 01:58:52,590
Open the gate! Quick!

1101
01:59:23,622 --> 01:59:25,624
Quick! Hurry!

1102
01:59:39,387 --> 01:59:41,014
Faramir!

1103
01:59:42,015 --> 01:59:45,268
Say not that he has fallen.

1104
01:59:46,436 --> 01:59:47,979
They were outnumbered.

1105
01:59:48,396 --> 01:59:49,981
None survived.

1106
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:52,692
Fear.

1107
01:59:53,234 --> 01:59:56,446
The city is rank with it.

1108
01:59:58,782 --> 02:00:01,242
Let us ease their pain.

1109
02:00:01,493 --> 02:00:03,244
Release the prisoners.

1110
02:00:03,411 --> 02:00:05,372
Catapults!

1111
02:00:18,718 --> 02:00:22,180
My sons are spent.

1112
02:00:23,223 --> 02:00:26,142
My line has ended.

1113
02:00:28,979 --> 02:00:30,397
He's alive!

1114
02:00:30,563 --> 02:00:33,733
The House of Stewards has failed.

1115
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:35,360
He needs medicine, my lord.

1116
02:00:36,403 --> 02:00:39,072
My line has ended!

1117
02:00:40,573 --> 02:00:42,575
My lord!

1118
02:00:56,089 --> 02:00:57,924
Rohan...

1119
02:00:58,675 --> 02:01:01,094
...has deserted us.

1120
02:01:15,525 --> 02:01:18,737
Théoden's betrayed me.

1121
02:01:29,873 --> 02:01:31,708
Abandon your posts!

1122
02:01:32,751 --> 02:01:36,671
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1123
02:01:46,806 --> 02:01:48,350
Prepare for battle!

1124
02:01:48,892 --> 02:01:52,062
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1125
02:01:53,229 --> 02:01:55,190
Over here!

1126
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:58,318
Return to your posts!

1127
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:11,748
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1128
02:02:21,925 --> 02:02:23,385
Stay where you are.

1129
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:41,778
We need more rubble!

1130
02:02:41,945 --> 02:02:43,822
Watch out!

1131
02:02:43,989 --> 02:02:46,533
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1132
02:02:48,410 --> 02:02:49,953
Double up, men!

1133
02:03:58,938 --> 02:04:01,941
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1134
02:04:02,442 --> 02:04:05,945
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1135
02:04:46,611 --> 02:04:48,238
Not at the towers!

1136
02:04:48,405 --> 02:04:51,408
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1137
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:53,994
Bring them down!

1138
02:05:29,112 --> 02:05:31,156
Fight them back!

1139
02:05:31,323 --> 02:05:33,325
Peregrin Took!

1140
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:37,370
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1141
02:05:53,053 --> 02:05:55,430
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1142
02:06:21,164 --> 02:06:22,624
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1143
02:06:23,249 --> 02:06:26,586
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1144
02:06:37,931 --> 02:06:40,892
What are you doing,
you useless scum?!

1145
02:06:41,059 --> 02:06:43,019
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1146
02:06:49,359 --> 02:06:51,778
Get back there and smash it down.

1147
02:06:51,945 --> 02:06:53,947
But nothing can breach it.

1148
02:06:56,866 --> 02:06:59,119
Grond will breach it.

1149
02:07:02,539 --> 02:07:04,624
Bring up the wolf's head.

1150
02:07:07,794 --> 02:07:13,133
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1151
02:07:13,466 --> 02:07:17,304
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1152
02:07:19,222 --> 02:07:22,642
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1153
02:07:23,351 --> 02:07:27,022
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1154
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:31,609
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1155
02:07:31,776 --> 02:07:35,488
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1156
02:07:55,494 --> 02:07:57,288
You may go no further.

1157
02:08:00,499 --> 02:08:03,461
You will not enter Gondor.

1158
02:08:03,878 --> 02:08:06,213
Who are you to deny us passage?

1159
02:08:06,380 --> 02:08:10,134
Legolas, fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

1160
02:08:12,386 --> 02:08:14,055
Mind your aim.

1161
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:23,147
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1162
02:08:23,314 --> 02:08:25,524
Prepare to be boarded.

1163
02:08:26,901 --> 02:08:28,152
Boarded?

1164
02:08:28,319 --> 02:08:29,987
By you and whose army?

1165
02:08:31,530 --> 02:08:33,824
This army.

1166
02:08:50,508 --> 02:08:52,343
In there.

1167
02:08:54,011 --> 02:08:55,888
What is this place?

1168
02:09:00,309 --> 02:09:03,688
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1169
02:09:05,064 --> 02:09:09,068
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1170
02:09:11,153 --> 02:09:13,406
It's the only way.

1171
02:09:15,783 --> 02:09:17,785
Go in...

1172
02:09:18,327 --> 02:09:20,538
...or go back.

1173
02:09:23,207 --> 02:09:26,002
I can't go back.

1174
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:40,891
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

1175
02:09:41,058 --> 02:09:44,311
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1176
02:09:49,275 --> 02:09:51,152
Hurry.

1177
02:09:56,032 --> 02:09:57,992
This way.

1178
02:10:00,828 --> 02:10:02,621
Sméagol?

1179
02:10:03,581 --> 02:10:05,750
Over here.

1180
02:10:14,050 --> 02:10:17,219
It's sticky. What is it?

1181
02:10:17,386 --> 02:10:19,680
You'll see.

1182
02:10:19,847 --> 02:10:22,183
Oh, yes.

1183
02:10:22,350 --> 02:10:25,519
You will see.

1184
02:10:34,403 --> 02:10:36,072
Sméagol?

1185
02:10:37,365 --> 02:10:38,658
Sméagol!

1186
02:10:41,369 --> 02:10:43,287
Sméagol!

1187
02:10:52,546 --> 02:10:54,507
Sam.

1188
02:12:34,565 --> 02:12:36,692
<i>And you, Frodo Baggins...</i>

1189
02:12:36,859 --> 02:12:42,239
<i>...I give you the light of Eärendil,
our most beloved star.</i>

1190
02:12:43,032 --> 02:12:46,327
<i>May it be a light for you
in dark places...</i>

1191
02:12:46,494 --> 02:12:50,331
<i>...when all other lights go out.</i>

1192
02:14:06,365 --> 02:14:09,660
<i>Naughty little fly.</i>

1193
02:14:09,827 --> 02:14:13,039
<i>Why does he cry?</i>

1194
02:14:13,581 --> 02:14:16,917
<i>Caught in a web.</i>

1195
02:14:17,084 --> 02:14:19,837
<i>Soon you'll be...</i>

1196
02:14:20,212 --> 02:14:22,048
Eaten.

1197
02:14:59,210 --> 02:15:01,921
Got away, did it, precious?

1198
02:15:02,088 --> 02:15:04,215
Not this time.

1199
02:15:04,382 --> 02:15:07,468
- Not this time!
- No!

1200
02:15:14,308 --> 02:15:17,645
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1201
02:15:18,104 --> 02:15:20,731
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

1202
02:15:20,898 --> 02:15:22,817
We promised.

1203
02:15:22,984 --> 02:15:25,486
You must believe us.

1204
02:15:25,653 --> 02:15:27,363
It was the precious.

1205
02:15:27,530 --> 02:15:32,326
The precious made us do it.

1206
02:15:49,427 --> 02:15:52,346
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.

1207
02:16:01,355 --> 02:16:04,692
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1208
02:16:14,869 --> 02:16:16,203
No!

1209
02:16:39,435 --> 02:16:41,854
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1210
02:16:46,317 --> 02:16:48,903
I'm so sorry.

1211
02:17:14,637 --> 02:17:19,475
<i>This task was appointed to you,
Frodo of the Shire.</i>

1212
02:17:20,601 --> 02:17:23,020
<i>If you do not find a way...</i>

1213
02:17:24,271 --> 02:17:25,523
<i>...no one will.</i>

1214
02:17:59,348 --> 02:18:02,101
The scouts report
Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1215
02:18:02,268 --> 02:18:04,562
The lower level's in flames.

1216
02:18:05,021 --> 02:18:07,481
Everywhere,
legions of the enemy advance.

1217
02:18:07,648 --> 02:18:08,858
Time is against us.

1218
02:18:09,442 --> 02:18:10,776
Make ready!

1219
02:18:10,943 --> 02:18:12,778
Take heart, Merry.

1220
02:18:12,945 --> 02:18:15,156
It will soon be over.

1221
02:18:15,740 --> 02:18:17,325
My lady...

1222
02:18:17,908 --> 02:18:20,494
...you are fair and brave...

1223
02:18:20,828 --> 02:18:23,247
...and have much to live for...

1224
02:18:24,582 --> 02:18:27,001
...and many who love you.

1225
02:18:29,754 --> 02:18:32,506
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1226
02:18:33,049 --> 02:18:36,260
I know there is not much point
now in hoping.

1227
02:18:37,470 --> 02:18:40,890
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds...

1228
02:18:41,057 --> 02:18:44,185
But I'm not.

1229
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:46,187
I'm a Hobbit.

1230
02:18:48,898 --> 02:18:51,400
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1231
02:18:54,779 --> 02:18:57,114
I just want to help my friends.

1232
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:00,701
Frodo.

1233
02:19:01,494 --> 02:19:03,287
Sam.

1234
02:19:04,872 --> 02:19:06,916
Pippin.

1235
02:19:08,334 --> 02:19:11,420
More than anything,
I wish I could see them again.

1236
02:19:15,633 --> 02:19:17,968
Prepare to move out!

1237
02:19:18,135 --> 02:19:20,930
Make haste.
We ride through the night.

1238
02:19:37,571 --> 02:19:38,906
To battle.

1239
02:19:39,323 --> 02:19:40,825
To battle.

1240
02:20:03,848 --> 02:20:05,641
Back to the gate!

1241
02:20:05,933 --> 02:20:08,102
Hurry!

1242
02:20:27,997 --> 02:20:32,501
I am steward of the House of Anárion.

1243
02:20:32,668 --> 02:20:35,046
Thus have I walked.

1244
02:20:36,255 --> 02:20:39,342
And thus now will I sleep.

1245
02:20:45,389 --> 02:20:47,516
Gondor is lost.

1246
02:20:47,975 --> 02:20:51,437
There is no hope for Men.

1247
02:21:06,035 --> 02:21:08,871
Why do the fools fly?

1248
02:21:10,414 --> 02:21:13,501
Better to die sooner than late.

1249
02:21:15,628 --> 02:21:17,713
For die we must.

1250
02:21:29,850 --> 02:21:32,895
No tomb for Denethor
and Faramir.

1251
02:21:34,021 --> 02:21:40,027
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1252
02:21:40,194 --> 02:21:45,366
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

1253
02:21:49,036 --> 02:21:50,871
Bring wood and oil.

1254
02:21:53,624 --> 02:21:55,042
Steady.

1255
02:21:55,209 --> 02:21:57,253
Steady.

1256
02:22:11,642 --> 02:22:14,228
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1257
02:22:14,437 --> 02:22:18,899
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

1258
02:22:25,364 --> 02:22:26,532
Run!

1259
02:22:28,451 --> 02:22:29,952
Volley!

1260
02:22:30,703 --> 02:22:32,580
Fire!

1261
02:24:25,735 --> 02:24:27,778
Let him go, you filth.

1262
02:24:29,697 --> 02:24:31,365
Let him go!

1263
02:24:32,616 --> 02:24:34,785
You will not touch him again.

1264
02:24:37,913 --> 02:24:39,790
Come on and finish it.

1265
02:26:29,525 --> 02:26:31,152
Back!

1266
02:26:41,954 --> 02:26:43,247
Mr. Frodo.

1267
02:26:52,798 --> 02:26:54,800
Oh, no.

1268
02:26:54,967 --> 02:26:56,927
Frodo.

1269
02:26:57,219 --> 02:26:59,096
Mr. Frodo.

1270
02:27:03,684 --> 02:27:05,019
Wake up.

1271
02:27:08,856 --> 02:27:11,233
Don't leave me here alone.

1272
02:27:12,735 --> 02:27:15,196
Don't go where I can't follow.

1273
02:27:19,492 --> 02:27:20,868
Wake up.

1274
02:27:27,541 --> 02:27:29,752
Not asleep.

1275
02:27:31,879 --> 02:27:33,798
Dead.

1276
02:27:52,566 --> 02:27:54,068
You get back, you scum!

1277
02:28:03,661 --> 02:28:04,996
What's this?

1278
02:28:06,163 --> 02:28:08,916
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

1279
02:28:10,918 --> 02:28:13,421
Killed another one, has she?

1280
02:28:13,629 --> 02:28:15,589
No.

1281
02:28:18,300 --> 02:28:20,302
This fellow ain't dead.

1282
02:28:20,636 --> 02:28:22,930
Not dead?

1283
02:28:23,097 --> 02:28:28,894
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1284
02:28:29,228 --> 02:28:31,981
Then she has her way with them.

1285
02:28:32,315 --> 02:28:34,025
That's how she likes to feed.

1286
02:28:34,525 --> 02:28:36,652
Fresh blood.

1287
02:28:36,819 --> 02:28:39,155
Get him to the tower!

1288
02:28:42,616 --> 02:28:44,327
Samwise, you fool.

1289
02:28:44,493 --> 02:28:47,330
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

1290
02:28:47,496 --> 02:28:49,999
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1291
02:29:14,273 --> 02:29:17,526
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1292
02:29:18,569 --> 02:29:20,029
He is burning.

1293
02:29:21,155 --> 02:29:22,490
Already burning.

1294
02:29:22,865 --> 02:29:24,867
He's not dead.

1295
02:29:25,326 --> 02:29:26,994
He's not dead!

1296
02:29:29,205 --> 02:29:30,998
No! No!

1297
02:29:31,165 --> 02:29:33,501
No! No!

1298
02:29:33,668 --> 02:29:35,670
He's not dead!

1299
02:29:36,045 --> 02:29:39,507
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

1300
02:29:39,674 --> 02:29:43,010
I release you from my service.

1301
02:29:44,345 --> 02:29:48,683
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

1302
02:29:50,851 --> 02:29:53,187
Pour oil on the wood!

1303
02:29:54,897 --> 02:29:56,941
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1304
02:29:57,441 --> 02:30:00,361
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

1305
02:30:00,736 --> 02:30:02,196
Where is Gandalf?

1306
02:30:03,322 --> 02:30:04,699
Gandalf!

1307
02:30:10,037 --> 02:30:11,205
Retreat!

1308
02:30:13,374 --> 02:30:15,126
The city is breached!

1309
02:30:15,292 --> 02:30:18,254
Fall back to the second level!

1310
02:30:22,049 --> 02:30:23,634
Get the women and children out!

1311
02:30:24,010 --> 02:30:25,761
Get them out!

1312
02:30:25,928 --> 02:30:27,430
Retreat!

1313
02:30:27,596 --> 02:30:29,390
Come on. Come on.

1314
02:30:29,724 --> 02:30:33,978
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1315
02:30:41,986 --> 02:30:44,405
Take them down!

1316
02:31:04,925 --> 02:31:07,803
Fight. Fight to the last man!

1317
02:31:07,970 --> 02:31:09,263
Fight for your lives!

1318
02:31:09,430 --> 02:31:10,681
Gandalf!

1319
02:31:15,061 --> 02:31:16,437
Gandalf!

1320
02:31:16,604 --> 02:31:19,190
Denethor has lost his mind!

1321
02:31:19,357 --> 02:31:21,651
He's burning Faramir alive!

1322
02:31:21,817 --> 02:31:23,611
Up! Quickly!

1323
02:31:30,451 --> 02:31:31,952
Go back to the abyss.

1324
02:31:33,454 --> 02:31:36,624
Fall into the nothingness
that awaits you and your master.

1325
02:31:36,791 --> 02:31:43,297
Do you not know death when you see it,
old man?

1326
02:31:43,464 --> 02:31:48,135
This is my hour.

1327
02:31:57,687 --> 02:31:59,271
Gandalf!

1328
02:32:08,155 --> 02:32:11,701
You have failed.

1329
02:32:12,493 --> 02:32:17,331
The world of Men will fall.

1330
02:33:14,597 --> 02:33:16,057
Courage, Merry.

1331
02:33:16,223 --> 02:33:18,601
Courage for our friends.

1332
02:33:22,146 --> 02:33:25,232
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1333
02:33:25,399 --> 02:33:28,653
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1334
02:33:36,744 --> 02:33:39,914
Éomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

1335
02:33:40,081 --> 02:33:41,332
Flank ready.

1336
02:33:41,499 --> 02:33:44,377
Gamling, follow the king's banner
down the center.

1337
02:33:44,543 --> 02:33:48,255
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

1338
02:33:48,422 --> 02:33:51,175
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1339
02:33:51,342 --> 02:33:55,179
Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

1340
02:33:55,429 --> 02:34:00,601
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

1341
02:34:00,810 --> 02:34:04,522
...a sword-day, a red day...

1342
02:34:04,689 --> 02:34:08,275
...ere the sun rises!

1343
02:34:16,033 --> 02:34:20,371
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

1344
02:34:26,711 --> 02:34:28,796
Ride now!

1345
02:34:30,297 --> 02:34:32,425
Ride now!

1346
02:34:33,009 --> 02:34:35,803
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1347
02:34:35,970 --> 02:34:38,723
...and the world's ending!

1348
02:34:40,641 --> 02:34:42,059
Death!

1349
02:34:42,476 --> 02:34:45,396
Death!

1350
02:34:45,563 --> 02:34:48,816
- Death!
- Death!

1351
02:34:49,233 --> 02:34:50,818
- Death!
- Death!

1352
02:34:51,527 --> 02:34:54,989
- Death!
- Death!

1353
02:35:00,077 --> 02:35:02,496
Forth Eorlingas!

1354
02:35:45,456 --> 02:35:47,208
Fire!

1355
02:35:51,003 --> 02:35:52,213
Death!

1356
02:35:56,425 --> 02:35:57,718
Charge!

1357
02:35:58,177 --> 02:35:59,762
Fire at will!

1358
02:36:57,111 --> 02:37:00,406
Set a fire in our flesh.

1359
02:37:18,049 --> 02:37:19,800
Stay this madness!

1360
02:37:24,138 --> 02:37:28,726
You may triumph in the field of battle
for a day...

1361
02:37:29,310 --> 02:37:32,897
...but against the power that has risen
in the east...

1362
02:37:33,064 --> 02:37:36,317
...there is no victory.

1363
02:38:05,513 --> 02:38:07,264
No!

1364
02:38:07,431 --> 02:38:10,101
You will not take my son from me!

1365
02:38:10,267 --> 02:38:12,603
No! No!

1366
02:38:23,531 --> 02:38:25,199
Faramir.

1367
02:38:38,754 --> 02:38:42,717
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1368
02:39:10,244 --> 02:39:12,038
Drive them to the river!

1369
02:39:14,790 --> 02:39:16,792
Make safe the city!

1370
02:39:56,791 --> 02:39:58,751
Re-form the line!

1371
02:39:59,877 --> 02:40:01,837
Re-form the line!

1372
02:40:08,844 --> 02:40:11,472
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1373
02:40:12,098 --> 02:40:14,266
Charge!

1374
02:41:33,220 --> 02:41:34,597
Cut him down!

1375
02:42:01,290 --> 02:42:03,918
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1376
02:42:06,295 --> 02:42:07,588
Left!

1377
02:42:24,981 --> 02:42:26,649
Aim for their heads!

1378
02:42:32,655 --> 02:42:35,950
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

1379
02:42:49,797 --> 02:42:51,299
Merry!

1380
02:44:04,705 --> 02:44:06,749
I didn't think it would end this way.

1381
02:44:08,042 --> 02:44:09,460
End?

1382
02:44:10,711 --> 02:44:12,838
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1383
02:44:15,341 --> 02:44:18,469
Death is just another path...

1384
02:44:19,053 --> 02:44:20,721
...one that we all must take.

1385
02:44:21,973 --> 02:44:25,434
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

1386
02:44:25,601 --> 02:44:29,230
...and all turns to silver glass.

1387
02:44:31,399 --> 02:44:33,359
And then you see it.

1388
02:44:35,277 --> 02:44:37,655
What, Gandalf?

1389
02:44:38,781 --> 02:44:40,116
See what?

1390
02:44:41,367 --> 02:44:43,577
White shores...

1391
02:44:45,246 --> 02:44:47,665
...and beyond.

1392
02:44:49,125 --> 02:44:50,918
A far green country...

1393
02:44:51,627 --> 02:44:54,547
...under a swift sunrise.

1394
02:44:58,592 --> 02:45:00,094
Well...

1395
02:45:00,261 --> 02:45:01,929
...that isn't so bad.

1396
02:45:02,096 --> 02:45:03,514
No.

1397
02:45:05,558 --> 02:45:07,226
No, it isn't.

1398
02:45:23,617 --> 02:45:26,954
Rally to me! To me!

1399
02:45:47,725 --> 02:45:52,271
Feast on his flesh.

1400
02:45:56,609 --> 02:45:58,986
I will kill you if you touch him.

1401
02:45:59,153 --> 02:46:04,617
Do not come between
the Nazgûl and his prey.

1402
02:47:13,019 --> 02:47:16,230
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1403
02:47:16,647 --> 02:47:18,899
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1404
02:47:19,066 --> 02:47:22,278
Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!

1405
02:47:37,752 --> 02:47:39,879
There's plenty for the both of us.

1406
02:47:40,046 --> 02:47:42,131
May the best Dwarf win.

1407
02:47:59,607 --> 02:48:01,817
You fool.

1408
02:48:01,984 --> 02:48:05,404
No man can kill me.

1409
02:48:07,782 --> 02:48:10,951
Die now.

1410
02:48:21,629 --> 02:48:23,631
I am no man.

1411
02:48:40,147 --> 02:48:43,651
- Fifteen! Sixteen!
- Seventeen!

1412
02:48:51,450 --> 02:48:53,369
Merry!

1413
02:49:35,369 --> 02:49:37,163
Legolas!

1414
02:49:59,560 --> 02:50:01,937
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

1415
02:50:49,026 --> 02:50:51,404
That still only counts as one!

1416
02:50:51,570 --> 02:50:53,739
Come on, then. Come on!

1417
02:51:37,450 --> 02:51:40,286
I know your face...

1418
02:51:42,163 --> 02:51:43,998
...Éowyn.

1419
02:51:46,584 --> 02:51:48,961
My eyes darken.

1420
02:51:50,087 --> 02:51:51,464
No.

1421
02:51:52,298 --> 02:51:53,924
No.

1422
02:51:56,010 --> 02:51:58,512
I am going to save you.

1423
02:51:59,847 --> 02:52:02,183
You already did.

1424
02:52:05,853 --> 02:52:07,480
Éowyn...

1425
02:52:08,981 --> 02:52:11,484
...my body is broken.

1426
02:52:16,530 --> 02:52:18,991
You have to let me go.

1427
02:52:24,872 --> 02:52:27,458
I go to my fathers...

1428
02:52:28,918 --> 02:52:31,754
...in whose mighty company...

1429
02:52:32,213 --> 02:52:35,549
...I shall not now feel ashamed.

1430
02:52:52,149 --> 02:52:53,776
Éowyn.

1431
02:53:40,281 --> 02:53:42,742
Release us.

1432
02:53:44,660 --> 02:53:46,370
Bad idea.

1433
02:53:46,537 --> 02:53:50,374
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.

1434
02:53:50,541 --> 02:53:52,543
You gave us your word.

1435
02:53:54,295 --> 02:53:56,422
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1436
02:53:57,757 --> 02:53:59,091
Go.

1437
02:53:59,967 --> 02:54:01,636
Be at peace.

1438
02:54:44,971 --> 02:54:46,889
Merry.

1439
02:54:47,473 --> 02:54:50,685
No!

1440
02:54:54,605 --> 02:54:57,024

Merry!

1454
02:57:00,314 --> 02:57:02,149
Merry.

1455
02:57:04,610 --> 02:57:05,861
Merry, it's me.

1456
02:57:08,489 --> 02:57:10,032
It's Pippin.

1457
02:57:12,535 --> 02:57:14,829
I knew you'd find me.

1458
02:57:14,996 --> 02:57:16,205
Yes.

1459
02:57:18,624 --> 02:57:20,710
Are you going to leave me?

1460
02:57:21,252 --> 02:57:22,962
No, Merry.

1461
02:57:24,255 --> 02:57:26,507
I'm going to look after you.

1462
02:58:10,509 --> 02:58:11,927
Hands off!

1463
02:58:12,094 --> 02:58:15,264
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1464
02:58:15,514 --> 02:58:19,685
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1465
02:58:21,228 --> 02:58:25,066
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

1466
02:58:25,900 --> 02:58:31,072
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

1467
02:58:51,759 --> 02:58:53,552
The scum tried to knife me.

1468
02:58:53,719 --> 02:58:55,471
Kill him!

1469
03:00:38,699 --> 03:00:40,701
That's for Frodo!

1470
03:00:41,077 --> 03:00:43,204
And for the Shire!

1471
03:00:46,791 --> 03:00:48,918
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1472
03:01:18,406 --> 03:01:21,742
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1473
03:01:22,868 --> 03:01:27,581
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1474
03:01:34,922 --> 03:01:36,590
Not if I stick you first.

1475
03:01:36,757 --> 03:01:38,301
Sam!

1476
03:01:43,347 --> 03:01:45,391
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1477
03:01:45,558 --> 03:01:47,601
Sorry for everything.

1478
03:01:48,102 --> 03:01:51,772
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

1479
03:01:51,939 --> 03:01:54,817
They've taken it. Sam...

1480
03:01:55,609 --> 03:01:57,111
...they took the Ring.

1481
03:01:57,862 --> 03:02:00,573
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1482
03:02:12,543 --> 03:02:14,754
I thought I'd lost you.

1483
03:02:15,129 --> 03:02:16,839
So I took it.

1484
03:02:18,007 --> 03:02:20,092
Only for safekeeping.

1485
03:02:21,344 --> 03:02:23,095
Give it to me.

1486
03:02:26,641 --> 03:02:28,851
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1487
03:02:33,522 --> 03:02:34,774
Sam.

1488
03:02:36,359 --> 03:02:38,319
Give me the Ring.

1489
03:02:59,048 --> 03:03:00,341
You must understand.

1490
03:03:03,844 --> 03:03:05,680
The Ring is my burden.

1491
03:03:06,847 --> 03:03:09,016
It will destroy you, Sam.

1492
03:03:12,186 --> 03:03:14,146
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1493
03:03:15,481 --> 03:03:17,108
We best find you some clothes.

1494
03:03:17,274 --> 03:03:20,319
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

1495
03:03:42,049 --> 03:03:44,260
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1496
03:03:44,760 --> 03:03:47,054
We made it to Mordor.

1497
03:03:48,389 --> 03:03:50,057
There are so many of them.

1498
03:03:51,017 --> 03:03:53,602
We'll never get through unseen.

1499
03:03:58,733 --> 03:04:02,069
It's him, the Eye.

1500
03:04:09,785 --> 03:04:12,413
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1501
03:04:12,872 --> 03:04:14,915
There's nothing for it.

1502
03:04:17,918 --> 03:04:22,340
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1503
03:04:31,682 --> 03:04:34,935
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1504
03:04:36,270 --> 03:04:39,106
The darkness is deepening.

1505
03:04:39,273 --> 03:04:41,651
If Sauron had the Ring,
we would know it.

1506
03:04:41,817 --> 03:04:43,861
It's only a matter of time.

1507
03:04:45,363 --> 03:04:47,782
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1508
03:04:48,824 --> 03:04:53,329
...but behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

1509
03:04:53,496 --> 03:04:55,331
Let him stay there.

1510
03:04:55,498 --> 03:04:58,167
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1511
03:04:58,334 --> 03:05:03,506
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1512
03:05:10,262 --> 03:05:12,765
I've sent him to his death.

1513
03:05:14,308 --> 03:05:15,601
No.

1514
03:05:16,102 --> 03:05:18,521
There is still hope for Frodo.

1515
03:05:18,854 --> 03:05:22,984
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1516
03:05:24,068 --> 03:05:26,654
- We can give him that.
- How?

1517
03:05:26,988 --> 03:05:29,699
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1518
03:05:29,865 --> 03:05:31,993
Empty his lands.

1519
03:05:32,201 --> 03:05:35,287
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1520
03:05:35,913 --> 03:05:38,916
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1521
03:05:39,083 --> 03:05:40,668
Not for ourselves.

1522
03:05:40,876 --> 03:05:46,465
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1523
03:05:48,259 --> 03:05:52,054
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1524
03:05:52,805 --> 03:05:54,015
A diversion.

1525
03:05:54,181 --> 03:05:55,975
Certainty of death...

1526
03:05:56,142 --> 03:05:58,894
...small chance of success...

1527
03:05:59,770 --> 03:06:01,355
...what are we waiting for?

1528
03:06:01,939 --> 03:06:04,358
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1529
03:06:05,151 --> 03:06:07,194
He will not take the bait.

1530
03:06:08,696 --> 03:06:11,198
Oh, I think he will.

1531
03:06:45,608 --> 03:06:48,235
Long have you hunted me.

1532
03:06:49,111 --> 03:06:50,404
Long have I eluded you.

1533
03:06:52,239 --> 03:06:53,824
No more.

1534
03:06:55,534 --> 03:06:57,953
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1535
03:07:42,456 --> 03:07:44,959
The city has fallen silent.

1536
03:07:46,627 --> 03:07:49,672
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1537
03:07:50,464 --> 03:07:52,174
It grows so cold.

1538
03:07:55,177 --> 03:07:58,222
It's just the damp
of the first spring rain.

1539
03:08:04,603 --> 03:08:07,815
I do not believe this darkness
will endure.

1540
03:08:36,469 --> 03:08:38,012
Look, the Orcs...

1541
03:08:38,554 --> 03:08:40,556
...they're moving off.

1542
03:08:41,599 --> 03:08:43,684
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1543
03:08:43,851 --> 03:08:46,187
...some luck at last.

1544
03:08:46,354 --> 03:08:48,189
Move it, you slugs!

1545
03:08:49,482 --> 03:08:52,860
Come on! Faster!

1546
03:09:00,868 --> 03:09:04,121
Come along, you scum...

1547
03:09:04,288 --> 03:09:08,542
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

1548
03:09:11,420 --> 03:09:13,047
Come on!

1549
03:09:13,214 --> 03:09:15,549
What have I told you?!

1550
03:09:22,390 --> 03:09:23,891
Get up!

1551
03:09:24,266 --> 03:09:26,936
Come on, you slugs!

1552
03:09:27,103 --> 03:09:30,731
You two are going straight
to the front line!

1553
03:09:30,898 --> 03:09:35,820
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!

1554
03:09:48,791 --> 03:09:52,628
To the Gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!

1555
03:10:02,013 --> 03:10:05,599
Don't you know we're at war?

1556
03:10:27,913 --> 03:10:30,791
Company, halt!

1557
03:10:34,629 --> 03:10:38,007
Inspection!

1558
03:10:38,174 --> 03:10:40,635
Sam, help me.

1559
03:10:40,801 --> 03:10:42,637
Mr. Frodo!

1560
03:10:45,348 --> 03:10:47,892
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.
Stand up!

1561
03:10:48,059 --> 03:10:49,894
It's so heavy.

1562
03:10:59,028 --> 03:11:00,196
Oh, no.

1563
03:11:05,826 --> 03:11:07,828
What do I do?
What do we do?

1564
03:11:10,873 --> 03:11:12,041
- Hit me.
- What?

1565
03:11:12,208 --> 03:11:14,251
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1566
03:11:14,418 --> 03:11:16,003
Get off of me!

1567
03:11:16,671 --> 03:11:19,006
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1568
03:11:27,640 --> 03:11:29,684
Get off of me!

1569
03:11:30,601 --> 03:11:32,520
Break it up! Break it up!

1570
03:11:35,064 --> 03:11:39,610
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't
shut this rabble down!

1571
03:11:39,819 --> 03:11:42,154
Go, Sam. Now!

1572
03:11:51,080 --> 03:11:52,623
Move along, scum!

1573
03:11:52,790 --> 03:11:54,709
Back in the line!

1574
03:11:55,209 --> 03:11:57,003
You maggots!

1575
03:11:57,670 --> 03:12:00,673
Get back into the line,
you slugs!

1576
03:12:03,092 --> 03:12:06,554
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1577
03:12:09,265 --> 03:12:11,225
Move it!

1578
03:12:55,353 --> 03:12:57,396
I can't...

1579
03:12:57,563 --> 03:13:01,317
I can't...
I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1580
03:13:01,525 --> 03:13:02,652
It's... It's...

1581
03:13:02,818 --> 03:13:05,404
It's such a weight to carry.

1582
03:13:06,280 --> 03:13:07,323
It...

1583
03:13:07,490 --> 03:13:09,450
Such a weight.

1584
03:13:14,455 --> 03:13:16,874
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.

1585
03:13:18,334 --> 03:13:21,462
There's no point carrying anything
we're not sure to need.

1586
03:13:36,644 --> 03:13:38,479
Mr. Frodo.

1587
03:13:39,981 --> 03:13:41,482
Look.

1588
03:13:44,068 --> 03:13:45,903
There is light...

1589
03:13:46,237 --> 03:13:48,656
...and beauty up there...

1590
03:13:48,823 --> 03:13:50,533
...that no shadow can touch.

1591
03:14:41,584 --> 03:14:43,210
Take mine.

1592
03:14:43,711 --> 03:14:45,838
There's a few drops left.

1593
03:15:01,062 --> 03:15:03,648
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1594
03:15:04,565 --> 03:15:07,735
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1595
03:16:00,621 --> 03:16:02,790
Frodo, get down!

1596
03:16:04,542 --> 03:16:06,460
Hide!

1597
03:16:16,595 --> 03:16:18,639
Frodo!

1598
03:16:24,478 --> 03:16:25,896
Where are they?

1599
03:17:01,974 --> 03:17:05,019
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1600
03:17:05,936 --> 03:17:08,773
Let justice be done upon him!

1601
03:17:52,274 --> 03:17:56,237
My master, Sauron the Great,
bids thee welcome.

1602
03:18:02,076 --> 03:18:05,788
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

1603
03:18:06,163 --> 03:18:09,292
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1604
03:18:09,458 --> 03:18:12,420
...faithless and accursed.

1605
03:18:12,586 --> 03:18:16,007
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.

1606
03:18:16,173 --> 03:18:18,843
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

1607
03:18:19,885 --> 03:18:22,430
Old Greybeard.

1608
03:18:23,848 --> 03:18:28,144
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

1609
03:18:33,149 --> 03:18:34,483
Frodo.

1610
03:18:37,320 --> 03:18:38,779
Frodo.

1611
03:18:39,780 --> 03:18:40,990
- Silence.
- No!

1612
03:18:41,824 --> 03:18:43,159
Silence!

1613
03:18:44,952 --> 03:18:48,706
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1614
03:18:49,707 --> 03:18:53,794
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

1615
03:18:59,300 --> 03:19:05,056
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

1616
03:19:07,683 --> 03:19:09,810
And he did, Gandalf.

1617
03:19:09,977 --> 03:19:11,729
He did.

1618
03:19:18,736 --> 03:19:20,237
And who is this?

1619
03:19:20,404 --> 03:19:22,490
Isildur's heir?

1620
03:19:22,657 --> 03:19:25,660
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1621
03:19:30,414 --> 03:19:33,000
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1622
03:19:35,127 --> 03:19:36,337
I do not believe it.

1623
03:19:38,339 --> 03:19:39,715
I will not.

1624
03:19:55,815 --> 03:19:57,608
Pull back.

1625
03:19:57,900 --> 03:19:59,944
Pull back!

1626
03:20:12,164 --> 03:20:14,208
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1627
03:20:16,669 --> 03:20:19,672
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1628
03:20:19,880 --> 03:20:21,674
Something's drawn its gaze.

1629
03:20:39,191 --> 03:20:41,944
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1630
03:20:44,030 --> 03:20:48,034
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1631
03:20:50,911 --> 03:20:52,788
I see in your eyes...

1632
03:20:53,164 --> 03:20:57,209
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1633
03:20:59,170 --> 03:21:03,090
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

1634
03:21:03,257 --> 03:21:06,552
...when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1635
03:21:06,719 --> 03:21:09,388
But it is not this day.

1636
03:21:09,680 --> 03:21:12,725
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1637
03:21:12,892 --> 03:21:15,770
...when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

1638
03:21:15,936 --> 03:21:18,397
But it is not this day.

1639
03:21:18,564 --> 03:21:20,232
This day we fight!

1640
03:21:22,693 --> 03:21:26,364
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1641
03:21:26,530 --> 03:21:30,785
...I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1642
03:22:59,248 --> 03:23:02,793
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1643
03:23:03,252 --> 03:23:05,588
What about side by side with a friend?

1644
03:23:09,133 --> 03:23:10,885
Aye.

1645
03:23:11,719 --> 03:23:13,512
I could do that.

1646
03:23:43,834 --> 03:23:45,920
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?

1647
03:23:48,881 --> 03:23:51,133
It'll be spring soon.

1648
03:23:51,926 --> 03:23:54,637
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1649
03:23:54,804 --> 03:23:58,474
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

1650
03:23:59,850 --> 03:24:03,854
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

1651
03:24:04,897 --> 03:24:09,276
...and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

1652
03:24:11,195 --> 03:24:13,698
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

1653
03:24:15,283 --> 03:24:16,993
No, Sam.

1654
03:24:17,159 --> 03:24:20,121
I can't recall the taste of food...

1655
03:24:21,247 --> 03:24:24,542
...nor the sound of water...

1656
03:24:24,709 --> 03:24:28,296
...nor the touch of grass.

1657
03:24:29,255 --> 03:24:30,798
I'm...

1658
03:24:31,674 --> 03:24:33,050
...naked in the dark.

1659
03:24:34,719 --> 03:24:37,013
There's... There's nothing.

1660
03:24:37,179 --> 03:24:41,892
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

1661
03:24:43,144 --> 03:24:45,062
I can see him...

1662
03:24:45,479 --> 03:24:47,148
...with my waking eyes.

1663
03:24:48,190 --> 03:24:50,651
Then let us be rid of it...

1664
03:24:51,235 --> 03:24:53,487
...once and for all.

1665
03:24:54,196 --> 03:24:56,282
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1666
03:24:56,449 --> 03:24:59,076
I can't carry it for you...

1667
03:24:59,493 --> 03:25:01,537
...but I can carry you.

1668
03:25:02,079 --> 03:25:03,831
Come on!

1669
03:25:34,236 --> 03:25:37,198
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1670
03:25:48,751 --> 03:25:51,379
<i>Elessar.</i>

1671
03:26:03,349 --> 03:26:05,768
For Frodo.

1672
03:26:40,720 --> 03:26:42,221
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1673
03:26:42,930 --> 03:26:45,141
A doorway.

1674
03:26:45,725 --> 03:26:47,393
We're almost there.

1675
03:26:49,729 --> 03:26:53,691
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1676
03:27:07,622 --> 03:27:09,290
Mustn't go that way.

1677
03:27:10,833 --> 03:27:13,294
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1678
03:27:13,461 --> 03:27:15,212
You swore!

1679
03:27:15,379 --> 03:27:17,465
You swore on the precious!

1680
03:27:19,342 --> 03:27:21,302
Sméagol promised!

1681
03:27:22,219 --> 03:27:24,221
Sméagol lied.

1682
03:28:16,732 --> 03:28:18,609
Frodo!

1683
03:28:45,720 --> 03:28:47,471
Eagles.

1684
03:28:48,889 --> 03:28:50,391
The eagles are coming!

1685
03:29:13,205 --> 03:29:15,082
Frodo!

1686
03:29:20,338 --> 03:29:21,631
I'm here, Sam.

1687
03:29:29,096 --> 03:29:30,723
Destroy it!

1688
03:29:41,275 --> 03:29:44,570
Go on! Now!

1689
03:29:44,737 --> 03:29:47,281
Throw it in the fire!

1690
03:30:00,670 --> 03:30:03,339
What are you waiting for?

1691
03:30:05,216 --> 03:30:07,593
Just let it go!

1692
03:30:40,793 --> 03:30:43,045
The Ring is mine.

1693
03:30:46,590 --> 03:30:48,342
No.

1694
03:30:48,759 --> 03:30:50,052
No.

1695
03:30:58,477 --> 03:31:01,147
No!

1696
03:32:45,584 --> 03:32:47,461
Yes!

1697
03:32:48,629 --> 03:32:50,339
Yes!

1698
03:32:51,465 --> 03:32:54,343
Precious! Precious!

1699
03:32:54,510 --> 03:32:57,680
Precious! Precious!

1700
03:33:50,608 --> 03:33:52,443
Give me your hand!

1701
03:34:00,785 --> 03:34:03,204
Take my hand!

1702
03:34:05,873 --> 03:34:07,208
No!

1703
03:34:14,465 --> 03:34:16,425
Don't you let go.

1704
03:34:21,013 --> 03:34:22,598
Don't let go.

1705
03:34:24,225 --> 03:34:25,685
Reach!

1706
03:35:54,857 --> 03:35:57,735
Frodo!

1707
03:35:58,319 --> 03:36:01,322
Frodo!

1708
03:37:22,695 --> 03:37:24,530
It's gone.

1709
03:37:28,993 --> 03:37:30,745
It's done.

1710
03:37:31,245 --> 03:37:33,247
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1711
03:37:34,624 --> 03:37:37,043
It's over now.

1712
03:38:02,693 --> 03:38:05,071
I can see the Shire.

1713
03:38:07,281 --> 03:38:09,617
The Brandywine River.

1714
03:38:11,744 --> 03:38:13,746
Bag End.

1715
03:38:16,082 --> 03:38:18,793
Gandalf's fireworks.

1716
03:38:19,210 --> 03:38:22,964
The lights in the Party Tree.

1717
03:38:24,465 --> 03:38:27,593
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1718
03:38:28,719 --> 03:38:31,430
She had ribbons in her hair.

1719
03:38:34,350 --> 03:38:37,311
If ever I was to marry someone...

1720
03:38:38,229 --> 03:38:40,481
...it would've been her.

1721
03:38:41,899 --> 03:38:43,985
It would've been her.

1722
03:38:56,163 --> 03:38:59,333
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...

1723
03:39:03,629 --> 03:39:06,549
...here at the end of all things.

1724
03:40:56,242 --> 03:40:58,286
Gandalf?

1725
03:41:17,930 --> 03:41:19,932
Frodo!

1726
03:41:39,702 --> 03:41:41,537
Gimli!

1727
03:43:24,515 --> 03:43:28,269
Now come the days of the king.

1728
03:43:33,274 --> 03:43:35,610
May they be blessed.

1729
03:43:55,880 --> 03:43:58,549
This day does not belong to one man...

1730
03:43:58,716 --> 03:44:00,593
...but to all.

1731
03:44:02,261 --> 03:44:05,181
Let us together rebuild this world...

1732
03:44:05,348 --> 03:44:09,602
...that we may share
in the days of peace.

1733
03:46:44,090 --> 03:46:46,175
My friends...

1734
03:46:51,472 --> 03:46:54,141
...you bow to no one.

1735
03:47:38,311 --> 03:47:40,438
<i>And thus it was.</i>

1736
03:47:40,604 --> 03:47:44,233
<i>A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.</i>

1737
03:47:44,400 --> 03:47:46,944
<i>And the Fellowship of the Ring...</i>

1738
03:47:47,111 --> 03:47:51,616
<i>...though eternally bound
by friendship and love...</i>

1739
03:47:51,782 --> 03:47:54,201
<i>...was ended.</i>

1740
03:47:59,206 --> 03:48:04,003
<i>Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...</i>

1741
03:48:04,170 --> 03:48:08,382
<i>...we found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight.</i>

1742
03:48:10,926 --> 03:48:13,638
<i>We were home.</i>

1743
03:48:20,186 --> 03:48:22,063
Hi.

1744
03:48:39,246 --> 03:48:41,457
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1745
03:49:29,547 --> 03:49:31,132
More of the same, Rosie.

1746
03:49:31,299 --> 03:49:33,301
Good night, lads.

1747
03:50:30,858 --> 03:50:34,862
<i>How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?</i>

1748
03:50:36,197 --> 03:50:38,407
<i>How do you go on...</i>

1749
03:50:38,574 --> 03:50:43,788
<i>...when in your heart
you begin to understand...</i>

1750
03:50:45,039 --> 03:50:48,000
<i>...there is no going back?</i>

1751
03:50:48,709 --> 03:50:52,380
<i>There are some things
that time cannot mend...</i>

1752
03:50:52,880 --> 03:50:55,800
<i>...some hurts that go too deep...</i>

1753
03:50:57,551 --> 03:51:00,388
<i>...that have taken hold.</i>

1754
03:51:21,075 --> 03:51:24,120
There and back again...
a hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins.

1755
03:51:38,551 --> 03:51:40,428
Mr. Frodo?

1756
03:51:43,764 --> 03:51:45,141
What is it?

1757
03:51:46,976 --> 03:51:50,938
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

1758
03:51:51,606 --> 03:51:54,317
It's never really healed.

1759
03:51:58,279 --> 03:52:03,534
<i>"There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale
by Bilbo Baggins.</i>

1760
03:52:04,285 --> 03:52:08,080
<i>And The Lord of the Rings
by Frodo Baggins."</i>

1761
03:52:08,581 --> 03:52:10,750
You finished it.

1762
03:52:13,628 --> 03:52:15,129
Not quite.

1763
03:52:15,963 --> 03:52:18,507
There's room for a little more.

1764
03:52:21,135 --> 03:52:25,348
<i>Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...</i>

1765
03:52:25,514 --> 03:52:28,809
<i>...that each of us must come and go
in the telling.</i>

1766
03:52:29,685 --> 03:52:32,521
<i>Bilbo's story was now over.</i>

1767
03:52:33,022 --> 03:52:35,942
<i>There would be no more journeys
for him...</i>

1768
03:52:36,108 --> 03:52:37,652
<i>...save one.</i>

1769
03:52:38,402 --> 03:52:41,989
Tell me again, lad,
where are we going?

1770
03:52:42,156 --> 03:52:44,158
To the harbour, Bilbo.

1771
03:52:44,325 --> 03:52:47,036
The Elves have accorded you
a special honour...

1772
03:52:47,203 --> 03:52:49,830
...a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

1773
03:52:51,540 --> 03:52:53,209
Frodo...

1774
03:52:54,627 --> 03:52:59,173
...any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

1775
03:52:59,799 --> 03:53:02,051
The one I gave you.

1776
03:53:05,680 --> 03:53:07,848
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1777
03:53:10,393 --> 03:53:13,020
I'm afraid I lost it.

1778
03:53:13,187 --> 03:53:14,981
Oh.

1779
03:53:15,606 --> 03:53:17,066
Pity.

1780
03:53:19,819 --> 03:53:23,698
I should like to have held it
one last time.

1781
03:53:52,852 --> 03:53:57,898
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

1782
03:54:12,079 --> 03:54:15,416
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1783
03:54:16,208 --> 03:54:19,003
The time has come...

1784
03:54:19,170 --> 03:54:22,465
...for the dominion of Men.

1785
03:54:23,591 --> 03:54:26,427
The sea calls us home.

1786
03:54:34,852 --> 03:54:37,021
I think I'm...

1787
03:54:37,188 --> 03:54:41,567
...quite ready
for another adventure.

1788
03:55:12,640 --> 03:55:14,934
Farewell...

1789
03:55:15,101 --> 03:55:17,853
...my brave Hobbits.

1790
03:55:19,814 --> 03:55:21,816
My work is now finished.

1791
03:55:25,736 --> 03:55:30,616
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

1792
03:55:31,284 --> 03:55:34,120
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

1793
03:55:37,665 --> 03:55:40,167
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1794
03:55:40,835 --> 03:55:44,839
...for not all tears are an evil.

1795
03:56:02,398 --> 03:56:04,317
It is time, Frodo.

1796
03:56:09,864 --> 03:56:11,866
What does he mean?

1797
03:56:14,327 --> 03:56:17,204
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1798
03:56:18,789 --> 03:56:21,542
And it has been saved.

1799
03:56:25,212 --> 03:56:27,882
But not for me.

1800
03:56:28,799 --> 03:56:31,260
You don't mean that.

1801
03:56:32,470 --> 03:56:34,555
You can't leave.

1802
03:56:43,022 --> 03:56:45,733
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1803
04:00:18,821 --> 04:00:21,699
