1
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,623
Bio-readouts are all in the green.
Looks like she's alive.

2
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:11,222
Well, there goes our salvage, guys.

3
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:39,202
How are we today?

4
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:41,003
Terrible.

5
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:43,757
Well, better than yesterday,
at least.

6
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,083
- Where am I?
- You're safe.

7
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:49,305
You're at Gateway Station.
Been here a couple of days.

8
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:52,223
You were pretty groggy at first,
but now you're OK.

9
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:55,305
Looks like you've got a visitor.

10
00:05:57,021 --> 00:05:59,393
Jonesy! Come here!

11
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:02,274
Hey, come here!

12
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:04,727
How are you, you stupid cat?

13
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,195
How are you!

14
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:07,983
Where have you been?

15
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:11,066
Guess you two have met, huh?

16
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:14,411
I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
I work for the company.

17
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:17,659
But ... don't let that fool you.
I'm really an OK guy.

18
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,867
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

19
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:24,959
They say that all the weakness
and disorientation should pass soon.

20
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:30,553
That's just natural side effects of such
a long hyper-sleep. Or something like that.

21
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:33,172
What do you mean?

22
00:06:33,265 --> 00:06:35,258
How long was I out there?

23
00:06:37,102 --> 00:06:39,724
Has no-one discussed
this with you yet?

24
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:42,305
No. But, I mean, I don't ...

25
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:45,398
recognise this place.

26
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:48,566
No, I know. Uh ... OK.

27
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:51,822
It's just that, uh,
this might be a shock to you.

28
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:54,400
- It's longer ...
- How long?

29
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:55,609
Please.

30
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:59,039
57 years.

31
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:01,663
What?

32
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:05,127
That's the thing.
You were out there for 57 years.

33
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:09,090
What happened was ... you had
drifted right through the core systems.

34
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:11,714
And it's really just blind luck ...

35
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:15,255
that a deep-salvage team
found you when they did.

36
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:17,425
It's one in a thousand, really.

37
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:19,843
You're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.

38
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:22,642
You could be floating
out there forever.

39
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:25,724
You OK?

40
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,319
Uh ...

41
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:34,946
Oh!

42
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:36,316
You OK?

43
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:44,617
Oh!

44
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:46,661
God!

45
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:50,300
Nurse! Please!

46
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,427
Someone get in here now!

47
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:55,006
No!

48
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:56,806
Now!

49
00:07:56,891 --> 00:07:58,089
Hold!

50
00:07:58,184 --> 00:07:59,097
Please!

51
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:01,426
Hold her!

52
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:03,475
Kill me!

53
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:12,983
No!

54
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:14,698
No!

55
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,365
Bad dreams again?

56
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,578
- You want something to help you sleep?
- No.

57
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:28,455
I've slept enough.

58
00:08:30,257 --> 00:08:33,377
Jonesy ... come here.

59
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,637
Shh!

60
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:42,761
It's all right.

61
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:46,139
It's all right now.

62
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:49,768
It's over.

63
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,797
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Been running behind all morning.

64
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:20,675
Is there any word about my daughter?

65
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:24,467
Uh ... I think we should worry
about the hearing now.

66
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:26,638
I read your deposition ...

67
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,601
and it's great.
If you stick to that, we'll be fine.

68
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:32,646
There are gonna be
a lot of heavyweights in there.

69
00:09:32,736 --> 00:09:34,895
Feds, Interstellar Commerce Commission ...

70
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:38,155
Colonial Administration,
insurance company guys.

71
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:40,733
Do you have any news
about my daughter?

72
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:46,456
Well, we did come up with some
information. Why don't we sit down?

73
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:49,377
I was hoping to wait
until after the inquest.

74
00:09:49,461 --> 00:09:50,837
Uh ...

75
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:57,754
Amanda Ripley McClaren ...
Her married name, I guess?

76
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,588
Age 66.

77
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,386
And that was at the time
of her death ...

78
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:06,425
which was two years ago.

79
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,928
I'm real sorry.

80
00:10:20,117 --> 00:10:21,148
Amy ...

81
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:25,446
She was cremated ...

82
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:29,157
and interred at Westlake Repository,
in Little Shoot, Wisconsin.

83
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:31,327
No children mentioned.

84
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:38,214
I promised her ...

85
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:42,095
that I would be home
for her birthday.

86
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:47,014
Her eleventh birthday.

87
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:52,435
Ohh ...

88
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:58,071
They'd like to go back to this
point about the override destruct order.

89
00:10:58,447 --> 00:11:00,440
I don't understand this.

90
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:03,534
We have been here
for three and a half hours.

91
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:06,739
How many different ways
do you want the same story?

92
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,365
Look at it
from our perspective, please.

93
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,329
Please?

94
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:21,463
You admit to detonating the engines of, and
thereby destroying, an M-Class star freighter.

95
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:23,842
An expensive piece of hardware.

96
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:26,885
42 million in adjusted dollars.

97
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:29,431
That's minus payload, of course.

98
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,811
The lifeboat's flight recorder corroborates
some elements of your account.

99
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,942
In that, for reasons unknown,
the Nostromo set down on LV-426 ...

100
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,782
an unsurveyed planet at that time.

101
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:47,778
That it resumed its course, and was
subsequently set for self-destruct by you ...

102
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:49,282
for reasons unknown.

103
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:51,531
Not for reasons unknown. I told you.

104
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:57,664
We set down there on company orders to get
this thing, which destroyed my crew ...

105
00:11:57,756 --> 00:12:00,129
and your expensive ship.

106
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:06,090
The analysis team found no physical
evidence of the creature you describe.

107
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:07,841
Good!

108
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:11,468
That's because I blew it out
of the goddamn air lock.

109
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:14,432
Like I said.

110
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:21,400
Are there any species like
this hostile organism on LV-426?

111
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:23,896
No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.

112
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:29,576
Did IQ's just drop sharply
while I was away?

113
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:34,788
Ma'am, I already said it was not indigenous.
It was a derelict spacecraft. An alien ship.

114
00:12:34,877 --> 00:12:36,454
It was not from there.

115
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:39,463
Do you get it?
We homed in on its beacon.

116
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:45,254
And found something never recorded
once in over 300 surveyed worlds.

117
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:47,970
A creature that "gestates ...

118
00:12:48,057 --> 00:12:50,808
inside a living human host".
- Yes.

119
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:52,304
These are your words.

120
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:55,846
- "And has concentrated acid for blood."
- That's right.

121
00:12:57,274 --> 00:13:02,150
Look, I can see where this is going,
but I'm telling you that ...

122
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:05,523
those things exist.
- Thank you, Officer. That will be all.

123
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:08,533
Please! You're not listening.
Kane ¡X the crew member ...

124
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:13,364
Kane, who went into that ship, said
he saw thousands of eggs. Thousands.

125
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:15,497
Thank you. That will be all.

126
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:20,412
Goddamn it, that's not all! If one of those
things gets down here, that will be all!

127
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:26,212
Then all this bullshit that you think is so
important ... you can kiss all that goodbye!

128
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:36,019
It is the finding
of this court of inquiry that ...

129
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:38,181
Warrant Officer E. Ripley ...

130
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:41,275
NOC 14472 ...

131
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,147
has acted with
questionable judgment ...

132
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:48,651
and is unfit to hold an ICC licence
as a commercial flight officer.

133
00:13:50,452 --> 00:13:53,821
Said licence is hereby
suspended indefinitely.

134
00:13:55,666 --> 00:14:01,005
No criminal charges will be filed against
you at this time, and you are released ...

135
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:05,216
on your own recognisance for a six-month
period of psychometric probation ...

136
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:09,761
to include monthly review
by an ICC psychiatric technician.

137
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:15,468
These proceedings are closed.

138
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,356
That could have been ... better.

139
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:31,319
- Look, I think ... Ripley?
- Van Leuwen.

140
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,538
Why don't you just check out LV-426?

141
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:36,739
Because I don't have to.

142
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:38,911
There have been people
there for over 20 years ...

143
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:41,411
and they've never complained
about any hostile organism.

144
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:44,125
What do you mean? What people?

145
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:45,625
Terraformers.

146
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,043
Planet engineers.

147
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:49,577
They go in and set up these
big atmosphere processors ...

148
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:52,877
to make the air breathable.
Takes decades.

149
00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:55,808
It's what we call
a "Shake 'n' Bake" colony.

150
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:59,558
How many are there?
How many colonists?

151
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:02,606
I don't know.
60, maybe 70, families.

152
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:04,150
Do you mind?

153
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,730
Families.

154
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:12,784
Jesus!

155
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:29,897
I'll be down in maintenance, OK?

156
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:32,193
- Al?
- What?

157
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:33,740
- Hey, Al.
- What?

158
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:37,822
Remember you sent some wildcatters
out past the alien range last week?

159
00:16:37,912 --> 00:16:38,943
Yeah.

160
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:41,114
One of them's on the horn.

161
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:44,872
Says he's on to something. Wants to
know if his claim will be honoured.

162
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,332
Why wouldn't his claim be honoured?

163
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:50,956
Because you sent them
on company orders, maybe?

164
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,712
Christ! Some honch in a cushy office on
Earth says "Go look at a grid reference".

165
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:58,924
We look. They don't say
why and I don't ask.

166
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:02,432
I don't ask because it takes two
weeks to get an answer out here.

167
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,678
And the answer
is always "Don't ask".

168
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:06,848
So what do I tell this guy?

169
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:10,808
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,
if he finds something, it is his.

170
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:12,979
- Lydecker?
- What?

171
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:16,737
You kids are not supposed to be
on this level! Get out of here!

172
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:51,855
You go in places we can't fit!

173
00:17:51,944 --> 00:17:54,814
So? That's why I'm the best!

174
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:59,781
Knock it off! If I catch you playing in
the air ducts again, I'll tan your hides.

175
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:01,908
Mom, all the kids play ...

176
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:04,569
Annie, come and have
a look at this, will ya?

177
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:18,255
Folks, we have scored big this time.

178
00:18:24,351 --> 00:18:26,178
What is it, Dad?

179
00:18:30,816 --> 00:18:32,394
I'm not sure.

180
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:37,188
Let's see if we can't get
a closer look at this thing.

181
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:41,907
- Shouldn't we call in?
- Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.

182
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:48,036
That's about as close as we can get.

183
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:51,411
Should we take a look inside?

184
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,226
You kids stay inside. I mean it.
We'll be right back.

185
00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:12,141
- OK.
- Bye.

186
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:32,854
Timmy, they've been gone a long time.

187
00:20:32,938 --> 00:20:35,892
It'll be OK.
Dad knows what he's doing.

188
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:41,483
Mayday! Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo
Two Four Niner calling Alpha Control!

189
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:44,573
This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner!

190
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,540
Hi, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman
of the Colonial Marine Corps ...

191
00:21:36,043 --> 00:21:38,119
Ripley, we have to talk.

192
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:42,128
We've lost contact
with the colony on LV-426.

193
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:50,715
I don't believe this.

194
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:52,966
You guys throw me to the wolves ...

195
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,633
and now you want me
to go back out there?

196
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:58,220
Forget it. It's not my problem.

197
00:21:58,315 --> 00:21:59,726
- Can I finish?
- No.

198
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:01,893
There's no way.

199
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:07,530
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.
I can guarantee your safety.

200
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:13,405
These Colonial Marines are tough hombres.
They're packing state-of-the-art firepower.

201
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:15,822
There's nothing they can't handle.

202
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,079
Am I right?

203
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:20,786
We've been trained to deal
with situations like this.

204
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,549
Then you don't need me.
I'm not a soldier.

205
00:22:24,258 --> 00:22:28,719
We don't know what's going on out there.
It may just be a downed transmitter.

206
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:30,880
But if it's not ...

207
00:22:31,348 --> 00:22:35,216
I would like you there
as an advisor, and that's all.

208
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:41,271
What's your interest in all this?
Why are you going?

209
00:22:41,358 --> 00:22:46,483
The corporation co-financed that colony
along with Colonial Administration.

210
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:49,857
We're doing a lot of terraforming,
building better worlds ...

211
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,192
Yeah. I saw the commercial.

212
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:55,453
Look, I don't have time for this.
I've got to get to work.

213
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:58,706
Oh, right. I heard you're
working the cargo docks.

214
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:00,500
That's right.

215
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:03,421
- Running loaders and forklifts.
- Yeah. So?

216
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:06,874
Nothing. I think it's great
that you're keeping busy.

217
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:12,554
And I know it's the only thing that you
could get. There's nothing wrong with it.

218
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:18,510
What would you say if I told you I could
get you reinstated as a flight officer?

219
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:22,103
The company's already agreed
to pick up your contract.

220
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:23,685
If I go.

221
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:26,980
If you go.

222
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:30,440
Come on, that's a second chance, kiddo.

223
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:34,613
Get out there and face this thing.
Get back on the horse.

224
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:37,788
Spare me, Burke. I've had my
psych evaluation this month.

225
00:23:37,873 --> 00:23:40,791
Yeah, I know. I've read it.
You wake up every night ...

226
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:44,328
soaked in sweat ...
- I said no! And I mean it!

227
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:48,708
Now please leave.

228
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:53,379
I am not going back! And I am ...
I would not be any good to you if I did.

229
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:54,551
OK.

230
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,719
Shh.

231
00:23:57,935 --> 00:24:01,518
Would you do me a favour?
Just think about it.

232
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:06,267
Thanks for the coffee.

233
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:20,164
Aagh!

234
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:27,714
Ohh!

235
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:16,719
Hello.

236
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:20,216
Ripley? You OK?

237
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:23,061
Just tell me one thing, Burke.

238
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:26,229
You're going out there
to destroy them, right?

239
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:27,857
Not to study.

240
00:25:27,942 --> 00:25:29,650
Not to bring back.

241
00:25:29,735 --> 00:25:31,478
But to wipe them out.

242
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:35,614
That's the plan.
You have my word on it.

243
00:25:38,118 --> 00:25:40,076
All right, I'm in.

244
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:52,627
And you, you little shithead ...

245
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:54,792
you're staying here.

246
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,156
They ain't payin' us
enough for this, man.

247
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,916
Not enough to have to
wake up to your face, Drake.

248
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,034
What?

249
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:38,628
- Is that a joke?
- Oh, I wish it were!

250
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:43,674
Hey, Hicks. Man, you look
just like I feel.

251
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:49,388
All right, sweethearts, what are
you waiting for? Breakfast in bed?

252
00:28:49,476 --> 00:28:51,849
Another glorious day in the Corps!

253
00:28:51,937 --> 00:28:54,559
A day in the Marine Corps
is like a day on the farm.

254
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:58,100
Every meal's a banquet,
every paycheck a fortune.

255
00:28:58,193 --> 00:28:59,818
Every formation a parade.

256
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,279
I love the Corps!

257
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:04,240
Man, this floor is freezing!

258
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:07,491
- You want me to fetch your slippers?
- Gee, would you, sir?

259
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:09,535
Look into my eye.

260
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,784
Fall in, people!

261
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:13,280
Come on, let's go.

262
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,202
I hate this job.

263
00:29:15,294 --> 00:29:18,295
Crowe! Wierzbowski! On your feet!

264
00:29:19,882 --> 00:29:23,465
I'm talking about breathing,
not this frozen shit.

265
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:26,090
Yeah, Top, how about it?

266
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:33,096
All right, first assembly's
in 15, people. Shag it!

267
00:29:34,271 --> 00:29:36,941
Hey, mira. Who's Snow White?

268
00:29:37,024 --> 00:29:40,559
She's supposed to be
some kind of consultant.

269
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,025
Apparently, she saw an alien once.

270
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:45,949
Whoopee-fucking-doo!
Hey, I'm impressed.

271
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:47,575
!Que bonita!

272
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:51,404
Hey, Vasquez.

273
00:29:51,497 --> 00:29:54,747
Have you ever been
mistaken for a man?

274
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,660
No. Have you?

275
00:29:56,752 --> 00:29:58,626
Oh, Vasquez!

276
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,623
You're just too bad.

277
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:14,510
Hey, Top, what's the op?

278
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:17,177
It's a rescue mission.
You'll love it.

279
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:22,018
There's some juicy colonists' daughters
we have to rescue from their virginity.

280
00:30:22,945 --> 00:30:25,732
Dumb-ass colonists!

281
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,405
What's this crap supposed to be?

282
00:30:30,494 --> 00:30:33,530
- Cornbread, I think.
- It's good for you, boy. Eat it.

283
00:30:33,622 --> 00:30:39,043
I sure wouldn't mind getting more of that
Arcturian poontang. Remember that time?

284
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:44,715
- But the one that you had was male!
- Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian, baby!

285
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,884
- Hey, Bishop. Do the thing with the knife.
- Oh, please ...

286
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,717
All right!

287
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:53,511
I don't wanna see that, man.

288
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,474
Come on, man. All right!

289
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:58,515
Hey, what are you doing, man?
What are you doing?

290
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,729
- Don't move.
- Quit messing, Drake!

291
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:02,358
Bishop! Hey, man!

292
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,768
- Do it, Bishop.
- Hey, not me, man!

293
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:07,068
Yeah, you. Don't move.

294
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,436
Trust me.

295
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:16,995
Aaaaggghhhhhh!

296
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,126
All right, knock it off.

297
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,163
Thank you.

298
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:30,671
Enjoy your meal.

299
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,514
That wasn't funny, man.

300
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,137
- Lieutenant Gorman?
- No.

301
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,186
- Mr. Burke?
- Yeah, thanks.

302
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:45,349
Looks like the new lieutenant's too good
to eat with the rest of us grunts.

303
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,072
The boy's definitely
got a corncob up his ass.

304
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,945
I thought you never missed, Bishop.

305
00:31:56,914 --> 00:32:00,450
You never said anything about an
android being on board. Why not?

306
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,998
It never ¡X never occurred to me.

307
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,089
It's just common practice ...
We always have a synthetic on board.

308
00:32:07,174 --> 00:32:09,795
I prefer the term
"artificial person" myself.

309
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,709
Right.

310
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,473
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry.

311
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,234
I don't know why I didn't even ...

312
00:32:16,357 --> 00:32:18,934
Ripley's last trip out, the syn ...
The artificial person ...

313
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:21,261
malfunctioned.
- Malfunctioned?

314
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:24,938
There were problems and ...
a few deaths were involved.

315
00:32:25,025 --> 00:32:28,229
I'm shocked.
Was it an older model?

316
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,690
Yeah. The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A-2.

317
00:32:30,773 --> 00:32:33,398
Well, that explains it.
The A-2s always were a bit twitchy.

318
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:36,426
That could never happen now
with our behavioural inhibitors.

319
00:32:36,512 --> 00:32:39,124
It is impossible for me to harm,
or by ommision of action,

320
00:32:39,253 --> 00:32:41,124
allow to be harmed, a human being.

321
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,284
Are you sure you don't want some?

322
00:32:45,504 --> 00:32:48,925
Just stay away from me, Bishop.
You got that straight?

323
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,218
Guess she don't like
the cornbread, either.

324
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:09,776
Squad! Atten-hut! Officer on deck!

325
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,689
As you were.

326
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,354
Quickly, quickly. Settle down.

327
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,241
All right, listen up!

328
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:22,870
Morning, Marines. I'm sorry we didn't have
time to brief you before we left Gateway ...

329
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:25,414
- Sir?
- What is it, Hicks?

330
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:28,622
Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.

331
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,584
What's the question?

332
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:35,459
Is this gonna be a stand-up
fight, sir, or another bug hunt?

333
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:39,634
All we know is there's still
no contact with the colony ...

334
00:33:39,725 --> 00:33:42,596
and a xenomorph may be involved.

335
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:45,604
- Excuse me, sir. A what?
- A xenomorph.

336
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:49,521
It's a bug hunt. What exactly
are we dealing with here?

337
00:33:50,277 --> 00:33:51,937
Ripley?

338
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:54,606
I'll tell you what I know.

339
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,529
We set down on LV-426.

340
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,616
A crew member was brought back with
something attached to his face ...

341
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:03,781
some kind of parasite.

342
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:06,626
We tried to get it off.
It wouldn't come off.

343
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,628
Later, it seemed to come
off by itself and die.

344
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,920
Kane seemed fine.

345
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:14,214
We were all having dinner.

346
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:18,714
It must have laid something inside
his throat, some sort of embryo.

347
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,597
He started ...

348
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,759
Um, he ...

349
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:25,971
Look, man, I only need
to know one thing:

350
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,139
Where they are.

351
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,901
- Go, Vasquez, kick ass!
- Anytime, anywhere.

352
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:35,611
Somebody said "alien". She thought
they said "illegal alien" and signed up!

353
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,821
- Fuck you, man.
- Anytime, anywhere.

354
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,486
Are you finished?

355
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,406
I hope you're right. I really do.

356
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:53,464
Yeah, OK, right. Thank you, Ripley.

357
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,084
We also have Ripley's report on disk.
I suggest you study it.

358
00:34:57,177 --> 00:35:01,674
One of those things managed to wipe out
my entire crew in less than 24 hours.

359
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:07,305
If the colonists have found that ship, there's
no telling how many have been exposed.

360
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,807
Do you understand?

361
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:13,774
Anyway, we have it on disk,
so look at it.

362
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,530
Any questions?

363
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,986
What is it, Private?

364
00:35:19,074 --> 00:35:22,075
How do I get out of
this chickenshit outfit?

365
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,904
You secure that shit, Hudson.

366
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,367
All right.

367
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,833
Now listen up.

368
00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:36,498
I want this thing to go smooth
and by the numbers.

369
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:42,254
I want DCS and tactical
database assimilation by 08:30.

370
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:47,590
Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
drop-ship prep details. We have seven hours.

371
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:50,054
Now move it, people!

372
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:54,608
You heard the man, and you know
the drill! Assholes and elbows!

373
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:57,184
Hudson, come here. Come here!

374
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,379
I don't care if you are short,
Hudson. Get it done!

375
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:20,459
- Sarge, you'll get lip cancer smoking those!
- Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed!

376
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,347
- How many more, Spunkmeyer?
- Last one.

377
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,304
Good. Take it away.

378
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,567
Clear behind.

379
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:53,542
Did you check number three?
Is this the non-op?

380
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:57,245
I feel like kind of a fifth wheel.
Is there anything I can do?

381
00:36:57,339 --> 00:36:59,747
I don't know.
Is there anything you can do?

382
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:04,503
Well, I can drive that loader.

383
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,966
I have a Class Two rating.

384
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,844
Be my guest.

385
00:37:56,398 --> 00:37:58,106
Where you want it?

386
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:03,861
Bay twelve, please.

387
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,628
We're a team and there's
nothing to worry about.

388
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:09,172
We come here, and we gonna conquer, and
we gonna take some. Is that understood?

389
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,798
That's what we gonna do, sweethearts.
Gonna go and get some.

390
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,596
All right, people, on the ready-line!

391
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,394
- Are you lean?
- Yeah!

392
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:18,974
- Are you mean?
- Yeah!

393
00:39:19,064 --> 00:39:21,187
- What are you?
- Lean, mean Marines!

394
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,445
Get on the ready-line!
Get some today!

395
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,647
Get on the ready-line!

396
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,029
Move it out!
Move it out, goddamn it!

397
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,901
Get hot! One, two, three!
Get out! Get out! Get out!

398
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:37,329
Move it out! Move it out!
Move it out!

399
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,121
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three!

400
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,960
Absolutely badasses!

401
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,289
Let's pack 'em in! Get in there!

402
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,460
Move it!

403
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,716
- Let's go, let's go!
- One, two, three, four, five, six!

404
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,809
I want combat seating.
You know your places.

405
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,471
Get those weapons stowed. Let's go!

406
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,641
Come on, settle down, people.

407
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,150
Lock 'em in, Hudson.

408
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,523
Ready to get it on? You know it!

409
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,321
OK, Bishop, let's go.

410
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,533
Roger.

411
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,449
I'm ready, man.

412
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,660
Ready to get it on! Go!

413
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,803
Stand by. Cross-locking now.
Pre-launch auto-cycle engaged.

414
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,550
Primary couplers released.
Hit the internals.

415
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:54,571
Confirm cross-lock
and drop stations secured.

416
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,577
Affirmative.
All drop stations secured.

417
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,792
Stand by. Ten seconds.

418
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,960
Stand by to initiate
release sequencer.

419
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,508
On my mark.

420
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,966
We're on an express elevator to hell!

421
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,217
Going down!

422
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,306
Two, one, mark.

423
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,969
Whoo-hoo!

424
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,648
Switch to DCS ranging.

425
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:41,240
- 2-4-0. Nominal to profile.
- We're in the pipe. Five by five.

426
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:56,676
- We're picking up some hull ionisation.
- Got it. Rough air ahead.

427
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,052
We're in for some chop.

428
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,030
How many drops is this
for you, Lieutenant?

429
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,696
38.

430
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,776
Simulated.

431
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,995
How many combat drops?

432
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,707
Uh, two ...

433
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,168
including this one.

434
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,587
- Shit!
- Oh, man!

435
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:48,226
Range 0-1-4. Turning on final.

436
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,191
I got a bad feeling about this drop.

437
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,982
You always say
"I got a bad feeling about this drop".

438
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,275
OK, OK.

439
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,821
When we get back without you,
I'll call your folks.

440
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:11,535
All right.
Let's see what we can see.

441
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,255
Everybody on-line. Looking good.

442
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:20,593
Drake, check your camera.
There seems to be a malfunction.

443
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,926
That's better.

444
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,429
Pan it around a bit. Good.

445
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,347
I'm ready, man. Check it out.
I am the ultimate badass!

446
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,932
State-of-the-badass-art!

447
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,934
You do not wanna fuck with me.

448
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,903
Check it out.

449
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,484
Hey, Ripley, don't worry.

450
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:47,039
Me and my squad of ultimate
badasses will protect you.

451
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,833
Check it out.

452
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,960
Independently targeting
particle-beam phalanx.

453
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,672
Whap!

454
00:43:55,925 --> 00:44:00,136
Fry half a city with this puppy!
We got tactical smart missiles ...

455
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:06,175
phase plasma pulse rifles, RPGs ...
We got sonic electronic ballbreakers!

456
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:09,602
We got nukes.
We got knives, sharp sticks ...

457
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,313
Knock it off, Hudson!

458
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,596
All right, gear up.

459
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:16,475
Two minutes, people. Get hot.

460
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,314
Somebody wake up Hicks.

461
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:35,293
- Coming around for a seven-zero-niner.
- Terminal guidance locked in.

462
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,254
Where's the damn beacon?

463
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,960
Oh, I see it.

464
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:49,260
- That's the atmosphere processor?
- Yep, that's it.

465
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,639
Remarkable piece of machinery.
Completely automated.

466
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,222
We manufacture those, by the way.

467
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,659
OK, Ferro.

468
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,072
Take us in low over
the main colony complex.

469
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:13,831
Storm shutters are sealed.

470
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:17,787
There's no visible activity.
All right. Hold at forty.

471
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,835
- Roger.
- Give me a slow circle of the complex.

472
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,350
Structure seems intact.

473
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,097
They still have power.

474
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,143
OK, Ferro.
Set down on the landing grid.

475
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,401
Immediate dust-off on my clear,
then stay on station.

476
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,748
Down and clear.

477
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,038
Ten seconds, people. Look sharp!

478
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,462
I want a nice,
clean dispersal this time.

479
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,174
Let's go! Move it out!

480
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,176
Head 'em out!

481
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:37,377
First squad up, on-line. Hicks, get
yours in a cordon. Watch the rear.

482
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,288
Vasquez, take point.

483
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,004
Let's move!

484
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,931
Move up.

485
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,512
Hudson, run a bypass.

486
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,735
Second squad, move up.
Flanking positions.

487
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,529
Second squad, on-line.

488
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,719
You set?

489
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:40,975
Go on.

490
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,676
Second team, move inside.

491
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,837
Hicks, take the upper level.

492
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,370
Sir, you copying this?

493
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,080
Looks like hits from small-arms fire.

494
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:48,413
We got some explosive damages,
probably seismic survey charges.

495
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,003
Are you reading this?

496
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,718
Keep it tight, people.

497
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,394
Hicks, Hudson,
use your motion trackers.

498
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,457
Nothing.

499
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:30,838
Not a goddamn thing.

500
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,633
Quarter and search by twos.

501
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,484
OK, Dietrich, Frost, you're up.

502
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,036
It's right in there.

503
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,213
- Now!
- Now!

504
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,092
Good one, Hudson!

505
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:05,342
Uh, sir, we have a negative
situation here. Uh, moving on, sir.

506
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,482
Wait, tell him to ...

507
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,985
Hicks, back up.

508
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,904
Pan right.

509
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,032
There.

510
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:27,033
You seeing this?

511
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:33,547
Looks melted. Somebody must have
bagged one of Ripley's bad guys here.

512
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,466
Acid for blood.

513
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:39,802
If you liked that,
you're gonna love this.

514
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,019
Quit screwing around.

515
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,354
Second squad, what's your status?

516
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,614
We just finished our sweep.
Nobody's home.

517
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,740
Roger. Sir, this place is dead.

518
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,497
Whatever happened here,
we missed it.

519
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,032
The area's secured.

520
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,952
Let's go check their computer.

521
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:12,451
- It's not secure.
- The area's secured.

522
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,547
First team, head for Operations.

523
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,717
- Hudson, get their CPU on-line.
- Affirmative.

524
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:22,254
Hicks, meet me at the south lock.
We're coming in.

525
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:25,882
He's coming in.
I feel safer already.

526
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,052
Pendejo jerkoff!

527
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:50,583
Sir, we got the CPU on-line.

528
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,210
No problem.

529
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,868
Good. Stand by in Operations.

530
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,589
OK, let's go.

531
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,605
Are you all right?

532
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,490
Yes.

533
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:42,127
Sir ... They sealed off
this wing at both ends.

534
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:47,130
Welded the doors, and blocked off
the stairs with heavy equipment.

535
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,261
But it looks like the
barricade didn't hold.

536
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,721
- Any bodies?
- No, sir.

537
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,556
Last stand.

538
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,222
Must have been a hell of a fight.

539
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,394
Yeah, looks that way.

540
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:07,108
All right, Drake, this way. You should be able
to cut through the med lab to Operations.

541
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,871
Lieutenant.

542
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,675
Gorman.

543
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,274
Are those the same ones?

544
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,531
Careful, Burke.

545
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:52,052
Looks like love
at first sight to me.

546
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:54,299
Oh, he likes you, Burke.

547
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,180
Two are alive. The rest are dead.

548
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:02,016
Surgically removed
before embryo implantation.

549
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:06,154
Subject: Marachuk, John J,
died during the procedure.

550
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,313
They killed him taking it off.

551
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,076
Yo, Hicks.

552
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:15,822
I think we got something here.

553
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,912
- Behind us.
- One of us?

554
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:26,006
Apone, where are your people?

555
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:29,923
- Anybody in D-Block?
- Negative. We're all in Operations.

556
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:37,633
- Talk to me, Frosty.
- Let's keep moving, baby.

557
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,405
- It's moving.
- Which way?

558
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,538
It's coming straight for us.

559
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,286
Straight up.

560
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,741
- Fuck!
- Hold up!

561
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:44,377
Ripley.

562
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,686
Hey ... shh, it's all right.

563
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:09,313
- It's all right.
- Grab her, Corporal.

564
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:12,487
Don't be afraid.
Come on. We won't hurt you.

565
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:15,028
Shh ... it's all right. It's OK.

566
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:18,320
Come on out. Come on. Easy, easy.

567
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:19,277
I got her!

568
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,328
Ow! Damn!

569
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:24,167
- Don't let her go!
- She's under the grill!

570
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,703
- Frost, get your light up here.
- Where'd she go?

571
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,583
Shine the light!

572
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,301
Down here.

573
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,094
Here. Here.

574
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,801
Keep back. Don't scare her.

575
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:41,596
- Grab her, man! We're gonna lose her!
- Damn it!

576
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:50,191
Wait!

577
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:18,637
It's OK. It's all right.

578
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:21,473
Don't be afraid.

579
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,137
See?

580
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,555
Wait! No, you don't!

581
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:31,099
It's OK! You're gonna be all right now!

582
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:33,316
Shh!

583
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,488
Easy! Easy!

584
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,527
It's gonna be OK. It's all right.
You're gonna be OK.

585
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:42,240
Shh, shh, shh!

586
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,156
Easy.

587
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,407
Easy.

588
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:24,031
- What's her name again?
- Rebecca.

589
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:27,572
Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.

590
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,617
Just start at the beginning.

591
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,000
Where are your parents?

592
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:35,297
Look, Rebecca ...

593
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:39,000
Gorman, give it a rest,
why don't you?

594
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:44,555
Total brainlock.

595
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:49,553
Physically she's OK. Borderline
malnutrition, but no permanent damage.

596
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:51,805
Come on. We're wasting our time.

597
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:02,944
Try this.

598
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:06,195
It's a little hot chocolate.

599
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,371
There you go.

600
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:12,452
Whoop.

601
01:01:12,962 --> 01:01:15,001
That good, huh?

602
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:20,332
Uh-oh.

603
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:22,670
I made a clean spot here.

604
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:26,097
Now I've done it! Guess I'll
have to do the whole thing.

605
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:39,774
Hard to believe there's
a little girl under all this.

606
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:42,482
And a pretty one, too.

607
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:50,122
You don't talk much, do you?

608
01:01:59,425 --> 01:02:03,469
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Just tell me what you're scanning for.

609
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:09,675
PDT's. Personal data transmitters.
Every colonist had one surgically implanted.

610
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:12,888
If they're within 20 clicks,
we'll read it out here.

611
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,186
So far, zippo.

612
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:20,695
I don't know how you managed to stay alive,
but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.

613
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:24,605
Newt.

614
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:29,823
- What did you say?
- Newt.

615
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:32,286
My name's Newt.

616
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:34,450
Nobody calls me Rebecca ...

617
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:36,619
except my brother.

618
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,165
Newt.

619
01:02:39,757 --> 01:02:41,465
I like that.

620
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:42,623
I'm Ripley.

621
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:45,461
It's nice to meet you.

622
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:50,220
And who is this? Hm?

623
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,429
Casey.

624
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:54,390
Hello, Casey.

625
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,481
What about your brother?
What's his name?

626
01:02:57,566 --> 01:02:59,274
Timmy.

627
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:04,197
Is Timmy around here, too?
Maybe hiding like you were?

628
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:09,110
Any sisters?

629
01:03:13,332 --> 01:03:14,707
Mom and Dad?

630
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:20,586
Newt, look at me.

631
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:24,920
- Where are they?
- They're dead, all right? Can I go now?

632
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,929
I'm sorry, Newt.

633
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:33,135
Don't you think you'd
be safer here with us?

634
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:39,061
These people are here to protect you.

635
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,142
They're soldiers.

636
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:44,022
It won't make any difference.

637
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,534
Need anything else?

638
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:05,043
Hello, Bishop.
Do you need anything else?

639
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:08,381
No.

640
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,179
Nice pet you got there, Bishop.

641
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:15,010
Magnificent, isn't it?

642
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:19,809
Yo! Stop your grinnin'
and drop your linen!

643
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,316
Found 'em.

644
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,563
They alive?

645
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:25,937
Unknown, but it looks
like all of 'em ...

646
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,402
over at the processing station ...

647
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,198
sub-level three ...

648
01:04:30,284 --> 01:04:32,691
under the main cooling towers.

649
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:36,570
It looks like a goddamn town meeting.

650
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:38,872
Let's saddle up, Apone.

651
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:40,537
Aye, sir.

652
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:44,621
Alright. Let's go, people.
They ain't payin' us by the hour.

653
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:47,751
Head 'em out!
OK, Frost, you're driving.

654
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:02,979
It's OK. Don't worry. It'll be OK.

655
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:45,852
I want a straight V-deployment.

656
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:47,852
Second team on left flank.

657
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:50,228
Advance on axial six-six-four.

658
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:54,815
Tracker on-line. Set the V-gain
to filter R-F ambient.

659
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:58,860
Hudson, tracker on-line.
Left and right, little buddy.

660
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:04,158
40 metres in, bearing two-two-one,
there should be a stairwell.

661
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,580
Check. Got it.

662
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,878
You want sub-level three.

663
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:16,964
Let's go, people. Hudson, you got
the point. Hicks, watch our tails.

664
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:20,142
Nice and easy.
Check those corners.

665
01:06:20,936 --> 01:06:23,012
Check those corners.

666
01:06:25,608 --> 01:06:27,684
Watch your spacing.

667
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:30,647
You heard the man. Don't bunch up.

668
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:33,311
Your transmission's showing break-up.

669
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:37,571
Probably getting
interference from the structure.

670
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:39,737
Use those lights.

671
01:06:40,331 --> 01:06:44,280
Next one down,
and proceed on a two-one-six.

672
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:46,499
Roger, that's a two-one-six.

673
01:06:47,588 --> 01:06:51,917
I'm not making that out too well.
What is it, Hudson?

674
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:54,714
You tell me, man.
I only work here.

675
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:11,986
What is that?

676
01:07:13,197 --> 01:07:14,276
I don't know.

677
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:17,234
Proceed inside.

678
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:37,379
Watch your fire
and check your targets.

679
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:40,591
Remember we're looking
for civvies in here.

680
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:50,895
Easy.

681
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:54,733
Tighten it up, Frost.
We're getting a little thin.

682
01:07:55,406 --> 01:07:57,482
Nice and easy.

683
01:07:58,784 --> 01:08:01,904
Looks like some sort
of secreted resin.

684
01:08:01,996 --> 01:08:05,828
Yeah ... but secreted from what?

685
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:08,585
Nobody touch nothing.

686
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:11,620
Busy little creatures, huh?

687
01:08:12,298 --> 01:08:15,880
- Hot as hell in here.
- Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.

688
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:18,383
Knock it off, Hudson.

689
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:31,684
- Lieutenant, what do those pulse rifles fire?
- Ten-millimetre explosive-tip caseless.

690
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:36,069
- Standard light armour-piercing round. Why?
- Look where your team is.

691
01:08:36,155 --> 01:08:39,654
They're right under
the primary heat exchangers.

692
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:40,488
So?

693
01:08:41,452 --> 01:08:46,161
So, if they fire their weapons in there,
won't they rupture the cooling system?

694
01:08:46,248 --> 01:08:49,617
- Yeah. She's absolutely right.
- So what?

695
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:53,957
This whole station is basically
a big fusion reactor.

696
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:56,252
Right?

697
01:08:56,467 --> 01:09:01,129
So she's talking about a thermonuclear
explosion and "Adios, muchachos".

698
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:03,891
Oh, great. Wonderful.

699
01:09:04,975 --> 01:09:06,600
Shit!

700
01:09:08,938 --> 01:09:10,052
Look.

701
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:12,555
Uh ... Apone.

702
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:15,022
Look.

703
01:09:15,653 --> 01:09:21,109
We can't have any firing in there. I want
you to collect magazines from everybody.

704
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:25,244
- Is he fuckin' crazy?
- What do we use? Harsh language?

705
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:28,365
- Flame units only.
- Sir, I ...

706
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:31,244
Just do it, Sergeant.
And no grenades.

707
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:37,000
All right, sweethearts.
You heard the man. Let's have 'em.

708
01:09:38,384 --> 01:09:41,053
Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.

709
01:09:44,098 --> 01:09:45,889
Damn!

710
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:48,259
You, too. Give it up, Ski.

711
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:50,843
Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.

712
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,306
Right on, Vas.

713
01:09:54,817 --> 01:09:58,565
Let's go, Marine. Give it up.
Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.

714
01:09:58,654 --> 01:10:01,524
- Thanks a lot, Sarge.
- Hicks, cover our ass.

715
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:03,524
Head 'em out, people.

716
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:09,694
I like to keep this handy,
for close encounters.

717
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:11,249
I heard that.

718
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:22,173
Any movement?

719
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:24,834
Nothing. Zip.

720
01:10:38,027 --> 01:10:39,770
Holy shit!

721
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,284
Newt, go sit up front.

722
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:56,622
Go on!

723
01:10:56,712 --> 01:10:57,957
Now!

724
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:29,284
Steady, people.
Let's finish our sweep.

725
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:34,029
We're still Marines, and we got
a job to do. Keep it moving.

726
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:36,579
Easy.

727
01:12:08,993 --> 01:12:10,155
- Top!
- What?

728
01:12:10,244 --> 01:12:11,904
We got a live one!

729
01:12:11,996 --> 01:12:16,243
- You're gonna be all right.
- Please ... kill me.

730
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,242
Stay calm. We'll get you out.

731
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:20,453
It's gonna be all right.

732
01:12:20,546 --> 01:12:23,463
- We've got to get her out!
- What is it, Dietrich?

733
01:12:23,549 --> 01:12:24,379
Convulsion!

734
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:26,166
Ohh!

735
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,466
Dietrich, get back! Get back!

736
01:12:28,554 --> 01:12:29,467
Aagh!

737
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:31,055
Aagh!

738
01:12:36,979 --> 01:12:37,975
No!

739
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:39,974
Frost, flamethrower!

740
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:42,735
Get back! Flamethrower! Move!

741
01:13:12,514 --> 01:13:14,222
Movement!

742
01:13:14,308 --> 01:13:16,799
What's the position?

743
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:19,058
I can't lock in!

744
01:13:19,146 --> 01:13:21,518
Talk to me, Hudson!

745
01:13:21,607 --> 01:13:24,774
Multiple signals!

746
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:26,983
They're closing!

747
01:13:27,071 --> 01:13:29,359
Go to infrared, people.

748
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:30,361
Look sharp!

749
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:33,699
What's happening, Apone?
We can't see anything in here.

750
01:13:33,786 --> 01:13:35,825
Pull your team out, Gorman.

751
01:13:41,627 --> 01:13:44,379
I got readings in front and behind!

752
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:45,661
Where, man?

753
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:46,919
I don't see shit.

754
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,249
He's right.
There's nothing back here.

755
01:13:49,343 --> 01:13:51,798
Something's moving and it ain't us!

756
01:13:53,389 --> 01:13:54,764
Shit!

757
01:13:54,848 --> 01:14:00,139
Tracker's off-scale, man.
They're all around us, man! Jesus!

758
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:03,730
Maybe they don't show
up on infrared at all.

759
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:08,399
Aagh!

760
01:14:10,614 --> 01:14:11,943
Aagh!

761
01:14:13,284 --> 01:14:14,398
Frost!

762
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:15,240
Aagh!

763
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:21,991
Come on!

764
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:28,462
Aagh!

765
01:14:29,091 --> 01:14:31,582
Jesus Christ, Apone!
What is going on!

766
01:14:31,677 --> 01:14:34,132
Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!

767
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:37,175
Dietrich! Crowe! Sound off!

768
01:14:37,266 --> 01:14:38,262
Frost!

769
01:14:39,643 --> 01:14:40,924
Frost!

770
01:14:44,148 --> 01:14:45,558
Wierzbowski!

771
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:47,389
Wierzbowski!

772
01:14:50,112 --> 01:14:51,606
Let's rock!

773
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:52,728
Yeah!

774
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:57,035
Who's firing? Goddamn it!

775
01:14:59,371 --> 01:15:01,447
I ordered a "hold fire".

776
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:05,874
They're coming out of
the goddamn walls in swarms!

777
01:15:05,961 --> 01:15:11,003
Uh, Apone, I want you to lay down
a suppressing fire with ...

778
01:15:11,091 --> 01:15:13,761
Vasquez! Drake! Hold your fire!

779
01:15:13,844 --> 01:15:17,842
Are you copying me?
Lay down a suppressing fire ...

780
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:19,758
with the incinerators,
and fall back by squads.

781
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:22,934
Say again? All after incinerators.

782
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:27,765
Lay down a suppressing fire with
the incinerators, and fall back ...

783
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:32,357
Aagh!

784
01:15:33,822 --> 01:15:34,854
Sarge!

785
01:15:34,949 --> 01:15:36,359
Apone ...

786
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,075
talk to me.

787
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,191
Apone?

788
01:15:39,286 --> 01:15:41,528
- Talk to me!
- He's gone!

789
01:15:43,248 --> 01:15:45,656
Get them out of there! Now!

790
01:15:45,751 --> 01:15:48,835
- Shut up!
- Hicks, whoever's left, get the hell ...

791
01:15:48,921 --> 01:15:50,712
- Shut up!
- Goddamn it!

792
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:55,211
Where's Apone?! Where's Apone?!

793
01:15:55,302 --> 01:15:58,422
The Sarge is gone!
Let's get the fuck out of here!

794
01:15:58,722 --> 01:16:00,715
Let's go, Marines!

795
01:16:01,517 --> 01:16:02,631
Hudson?

796
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:04,683
Vasquez?

797
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:07,893
- Hudson, look out!
- Get it!

798
01:16:09,525 --> 01:16:10,936
Hudson!

799
01:16:11,026 --> 01:16:13,944
- Hicks! Hicks!
- It's too much! Fall back!

800
01:16:14,029 --> 01:16:15,773
I told them to fall back.

801
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:18,984
- I told them to fall back.
- They're cut off!

802
01:16:19,451 --> 01:16:21,076
Do something!

803
01:16:21,787 --> 01:16:22,736
Fuck!

804
01:16:23,163 --> 01:16:24,326
Keep movin'!

805
01:16:24,415 --> 01:16:25,529
Hold on, Newt.

806
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:34,674
Ripley, what the hell are you doing!

807
01:16:41,098 --> 01:16:42,841
Turn around!

808
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:47,562
That's an order!

809
01:16:52,067 --> 01:16:55,519
- Get off me!
- Goddamn it, that's an order!

810
01:16:55,613 --> 01:16:58,364
You had your chance, Gorman.

811
01:17:09,918 --> 01:17:11,578
Come on!

812
01:17:12,588 --> 01:17:14,296
Come on, Drake!

813
01:17:31,148 --> 01:17:32,690
Let's move it!

814
01:17:33,859 --> 01:17:36,231
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

815
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:39,732
It's blocked, man!
We got to go around!

816
01:17:39,823 --> 01:17:41,567
Open the door! Hicks!

817
01:17:41,659 --> 01:17:44,363
Drake! We are leaving!

818
01:17:44,662 --> 01:17:46,156
Get them, Vas!

819
01:17:47,957 --> 01:17:49,285
Run for it!

820
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:52,450
Shit!

821
01:17:57,007 --> 01:17:59,712
- Let's go!
- Drake, come on, man!

822
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:09,518
Drake, come on!

823
01:18:12,773 --> 01:18:13,603
Aagh!

824
01:18:14,233 --> 01:18:16,475
- Aaaghhh!
- No!

825
01:18:18,529 --> 01:18:20,356
Fire in the hold!

826
01:18:20,447 --> 01:18:23,318
- He's gone!
- No! Drake's out there!

827
01:18:23,409 --> 01:18:24,986
Put it out!

828
01:18:25,077 --> 01:18:26,986
Drake's coming!

829
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:28,573
He's gone!

830
01:18:28,664 --> 01:18:30,206
No, he's ... not!

831
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:33,582
Forget him! He's gone!

832
01:18:39,425 --> 01:18:41,501
Get on the goddamn door!

833
01:18:44,763 --> 01:18:45,759
Eat this!

834
01:18:47,558 --> 01:18:48,471
Aagh!

835
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:53,056
Ripley! Go, go, go!

836
01:19:03,032 --> 01:19:03,862
Whoa!

837
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:04,779
Oh!

838
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,748
It's all right! We're clear!

839
01:19:58,837 --> 01:20:02,420
Ripley, you've blown the transaxle!
You're just grinding metal!

840
01:20:02,508 --> 01:20:04,168
Come on, ease down.

841
01:20:05,052 --> 01:20:06,131
Ease down.

842
01:20:06,762 --> 01:20:08,387
Ease down!

843
01:20:09,473 --> 01:20:10,552
Ease down.

844
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:24,519
You OK?

845
01:20:25,823 --> 01:20:27,899
I'm all right.

846
01:20:28,075 --> 01:20:30,151
Get away from me, man!

847
01:20:30,869 --> 01:20:33,787
- Lieutenant.
- What happened to Gorman?

848
01:20:33,872 --> 01:20:36,909
I don't know ...
Maybe a concussion.

849
01:20:37,418 --> 01:20:39,825
- But he's alive.
- No, man, he's dead!

850
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,669
- Wake up, pendejo! I'm gonna kill you!
- Back off!

851
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:45,667
Right now.

852
01:20:47,761 --> 01:20:50,087
Somebody get me a first-aid kit.

853
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:52,469
Hey. Hey, look!

854
01:20:53,017 --> 01:20:58,603
The Sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Their signs are real low, but they ain't dead.

855
01:20:58,689 --> 01:21:02,354
- Then we go back in there and get them.
- I ain't going back!

856
01:21:02,443 --> 01:21:04,400
You can't help them!

857
01:21:06,071 --> 01:21:10,733
You can't. Right now they're
being cocooned just like the others.

858
01:21:15,331 --> 01:21:18,949
Oh, dear Lord Jesus,
this ain't happenin', man.

859
01:21:19,043 --> 01:21:22,459
This can't be happenin', man.
This isn't happenin'!

860
01:21:22,671 --> 01:21:26,005
We've got seven canisters of CN-20.

861
01:21:26,091 --> 01:21:29,756
I say we roll them in there
and nerve-gas the whole fuckin' nest.

862
01:21:29,845 --> 01:21:32,965
It's worth a try, but we
don't know if it'll affect 'em.

863
01:21:33,057 --> 01:21:37,054
Let's bug out and call it even.
Why even talk about it?

864
01:21:37,144 --> 01:21:40,727
I say we take off and
nuke the entire site from orbit.

865
01:21:43,442 --> 01:21:45,518
It's the only way to be sure.

866
01:21:45,611 --> 01:21:48,861
- Fuckin' A!
- Hold on one second.

867
01:21:48,947 --> 01:21:53,111
This installation has a substantial
dollar value attached to it.

868
01:21:53,202 --> 01:21:54,577
They can bill me.

869
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:57,445
OK, look.

870
01:21:57,539 --> 01:22:01,833
This is an emotional moment
for all of us, OK? I know that.

871
01:22:01,919 --> 01:22:04,671
But let's not make
snap judgments, please.

872
01:22:04,755 --> 01:22:08,005
This is clearly an important
species we're dealing with ...

873
01:22:08,092 --> 01:22:11,508
and I don't think anybody
has the right to arbitrarily ...

874
01:22:11,595 --> 01:22:13,387
exterminate them.
- Wrong.

875
01:22:13,472 --> 01:22:15,014
Yeah. Watch us.

876
01:22:15,099 --> 01:22:20,140
Maybe you aren't up on current events,
but we just got our asses kicked, pal!

877
01:22:20,229 --> 01:22:24,143
Look, I'm not blind
to what's going on ...

878
01:22:24,233 --> 01:22:27,436
but I cannot authorise
that kind of action.

879
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:34,525
Well, I believe Corporal Hicks
has authority here.

880
01:22:35,869 --> 01:22:37,945
Corporal Hicks is ...

881
01:22:38,038 --> 01:22:41,372
This operation is under
military jurisdiction.

882
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:45,159
Hicks is next in chain of command.
Am I right, Corporal?

883
01:22:45,254 --> 01:22:47,128
Yeah.

884
01:22:48,048 --> 01:22:50,374
Yeah, that's right.

885
01:22:50,467 --> 01:22:55,462
Yeah. Look, Ripley, this is a
multimillion-dollar installation, OK?

886
01:22:55,556 --> 01:22:58,592
He can't make that decision.
He's just a grunt.

887
01:22:58,684 --> 01:22:59,715
No offence.

888
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:01,553
None taken.

889
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:04,059
- Ferro, do you copy?
- Standing by.

890
01:23:04,148 --> 01:23:08,097
- Prep for dust-off. We need immediate evac.
- Roger. On our way.

891
01:23:08,235 --> 01:23:13,063
I say we take off ... nuke the site from
orbit. It's the only way to be sure.

892
01:23:15,784 --> 01:23:17,444
Let's do it.

893
01:23:24,835 --> 01:23:28,619
Let's go! Pick it up, Hudson.
Pick it up, baby.

894
01:23:33,636 --> 01:23:35,758
All right. Set him down here.

895
01:23:42,019 --> 01:23:44,095
Move it, Spunkmeyer.
We're rolling.

896
01:23:48,942 --> 01:23:51,564
Hold on a second.
There's something ...

897
01:23:51,654 --> 01:23:53,730
Just get up here.

898
01:23:53,947 --> 01:23:56,154
I'm in. Ramp closing.

899
01:24:16,303 --> 01:24:17,679
Spunkmeyer.

900
01:24:19,181 --> 01:24:20,296
Goddamn it.

901
01:24:23,185 --> 01:24:25,142
Well, where the fuck ...

902
01:24:37,866 --> 01:24:38,531
Run!

903
01:25:20,993 --> 01:25:24,576
Well, that's great.
That's just fuckin' great, man.

904
01:25:24,788 --> 01:25:29,616
Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?
We're in some real pretty shit now, man!

905
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:31,868
Are you finished?

906
01:25:34,882 --> 01:25:36,756
You all right?

907
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:45,596
I guess we're not gonna
be leaving now, right?

908
01:25:45,893 --> 01:25:47,969
I'm sorry, Newt.

909
01:25:48,062 --> 01:25:50,849
You don't have to be sorry.
It wasn't your fault.

910
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:54,355
That's it, man.
Game over, man! Game over!

911
01:25:54,443 --> 01:25:57,278
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do?!

912
01:25:57,363 --> 01:26:01,443
Maybe we could build a fire, sing a
couple of songs. Why don't we try that?

913
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:06,195
We'd better get back cos it'll be dark
soon, and they mostly come at night.

914
01:26:06,288 --> 01:26:08,080
Mostly.

915
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:26,466
That's everything, right?

916
01:26:26,558 --> 01:26:31,553
This is absolutely everything we could
salvage out of the APC wreckage.

917
01:26:31,647 --> 01:26:34,980
We got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each.

918
01:26:35,067 --> 01:26:37,143
That ain't so good.

919
01:26:37,778 --> 01:26:41,194
We got 15 of these M-40 grenades.

920
01:26:41,281 --> 01:26:43,358
Don't touch that.

921
01:26:43,450 --> 01:26:45,028
Dangerous, honey.

922
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:50,030
- Is that the only flamethrower?
- Yeah. It's only half full, but it's functional.

923
01:26:50,124 --> 01:26:53,908
And another one's damaged.
I don't know about that one.

924
01:26:54,753 --> 01:26:56,034
But the good news ...

925
01:26:56,755 --> 01:26:59,756
We got four of these robot sentries ...

926
01:26:59,842 --> 01:27:02,878
with display and scanners intact.

927
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:05,675
They really kick ass.
They'll come in handy.

928
01:27:05,764 --> 01:27:09,714
How long after we're declared
overdue can we expect a rescue?

929
01:27:13,188 --> 01:27:14,848
17 days.

930
01:27:15,649 --> 01:27:17,725
17 days?

931
01:27:17,818 --> 01:27:22,314
Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your parade,
but we're not gonna last 17 hours!

932
01:27:22,406 --> 01:27:26,071
Those things are gonna come in here
like they did before, and ...

933
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,366
Hudson! Hudson!

934
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:34,406
This little girl survived longer than
that with no weapons and no training.

935
01:27:34,501 --> 01:27:35,533
Right?

936
01:27:38,881 --> 01:27:42,795
- Why don't you put her in charge?
- You better start dealing with it, Hudson.

937
01:27:42,885 --> 01:27:46,752
Listen to me. Deal with it,
because we need you ...

938
01:27:46,847 --> 01:27:48,923
and I'm sick of your bullshit.

939
01:27:49,016 --> 01:27:53,429
Now get on a terminal and call up
a floor-plan file. Do you understand?

940
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:57,684
Construction blueprints. Anything that
shows the layout. Are you listening?

941
01:27:57,775 --> 01:27:59,352
Yeah.

942
01:27:59,568 --> 01:28:04,313
I need to see air ducts, electrical
access tunnels, sub-basements ...

943
01:28:04,406 --> 01:28:07,158
every possible way into this complex.

944
01:28:08,202 --> 01:28:10,029
We don't have much time.

945
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,780
OK.

946
01:28:12,998 --> 01:28:15,074
- OK, I'm on it.
- Hudson ...

947
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:16,910
Just relax.

948
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,757
I'll be in med lab.

949
01:28:24,843 --> 01:28:28,295
I'll check on Gorman,
continue my analysis.

950
01:28:28,389 --> 01:28:29,337
Fine.

951
01:28:30,057 --> 01:28:31,432
You do that.

952
01:28:37,523 --> 01:28:41,355
So this service tunnel must be
how they're moving back and forth.

953
01:28:41,443 --> 01:28:45,939
Right. It moves from the processing
station right into the sub-level here.

954
01:28:47,533 --> 01:28:49,609
Come down on that.

955
01:28:49,702 --> 01:28:51,575
OK, come over.

956
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:55,199
Hold it. Go back.
OK, punch that in right there.

957
01:29:00,546 --> 01:29:02,788
- No. It's back here.
- OK.

958
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:06,969
Well, there's a
pressure door at this end.

959
01:29:07,052 --> 01:29:10,670
Couldn't we put a remote
sentry unit in the tunnel ...

960
01:29:10,764 --> 01:29:14,762
and then seal that door?
- But we gotta figure on them getting in.

961
01:29:14,852 --> 01:29:16,975
That's right, so ...

962
01:29:17,062 --> 01:29:20,763
we repair the barricades
at these two intersections ...

963
01:29:20,858 --> 01:29:25,354
and weld plate steel
over these ducts here, and here ...

964
01:29:25,446 --> 01:29:26,691
and here.

965
01:29:27,323 --> 01:29:30,359
Then they can only come at us
from these two corridors.

966
01:29:30,451 --> 01:29:34,235
Right. Then we put
the other sentry units here ...

967
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:35,990
and here. Right?

968
01:29:36,081 --> 01:29:38,157
- Right.
- Outstanding.

969
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,622
Now all we need is a deck of cards.

970
01:29:42,296 --> 01:29:45,001
All right, let's move
like we've got a purpose.

971
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:47,842
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

972
01:30:03,108 --> 01:30:04,900
Do your thing, baby.

973
01:30:04,985 --> 01:30:07,393
Vasquez, let's get
the hell out of here.

974
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:10,939
- A and B sentries are in place and keyed.
- Roger.

975
01:30:11,033 --> 01:30:13,156
Stand by. Arming now.

976
01:30:13,243 --> 01:30:14,702
Test it, Hudson.

977
01:30:14,787 --> 01:30:17,194
- Do it!
- Fire in the hole!

978
01:30:20,584 --> 01:30:23,455
OK! Let's get the hell out of here!

979
01:30:23,545 --> 01:30:25,621
We're sealing the tunnel!

980
01:30:25,714 --> 01:30:26,745
Come on, baby.

981
01:30:38,936 --> 01:30:41,012
For what it's worth ...

982
01:30:42,731 --> 01:30:45,103
Here, I want you to put this on.

983
01:30:45,192 --> 01:30:47,398
What's it for?

984
01:30:47,486 --> 01:30:52,314
It's a locator. Then I can find you
anywhere in the complex ... on this.

985
01:30:54,076 --> 01:30:56,152
It's just a precaution.

986
01:30:56,495 --> 01:30:57,954
Thanks.

987
01:30:58,372 --> 01:31:01,077
Doesn't mean we're
engaged or anything.

988
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:03,159
All right, what's next?

989
01:31:32,698 --> 01:31:34,240
Last stop.

990
01:31:39,038 --> 01:31:40,496
Get in.

991
01:31:40,914 --> 01:31:42,195
Scoot down.

992
01:31:43,584 --> 01:31:44,912
That's good.

993
01:31:45,002 --> 01:31:47,409
Now you lie here and have a nap.

994
01:31:47,504 --> 01:31:49,047
You're very tired.

995
01:31:49,131 --> 01:31:52,500
I don't want to.
I have scary dreams.

996
01:31:54,887 --> 01:31:57,757
Well, I bet Casey doesn't
have scary dreams.

997
01:31:58,057 --> 01:31:59,634
Let's take a look.

998
01:32:00,184 --> 01:32:02,390
Nope. Nothing bad in there.

999
01:32:02,478 --> 01:32:03,676
See?

1000
01:32:03,896 --> 01:32:06,351
Maybe you could just
try to be like her.

1001
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:09,645
Ripley, she doesn't
have bad dreams ...

1002
01:32:09,735 --> 01:32:12,487
because she's just
a piece of plastic.

1003
01:32:12,571 --> 01:32:13,900
Right.

1004
01:32:14,323 --> 01:32:16,150
I'm sorry, Newt.

1005
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:23,904
There.

1006
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:29,295
My mommy always said there
were no monsters. No real ones.

1007
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:31,419
But there are.

1008
01:32:31,507 --> 01:32:34,673
Yes, there are, aren't there?

1009
01:32:36,428 --> 01:32:39,180
Why do they tell little kids that?

1010
01:32:40,849 --> 01:32:42,925
Most of the time it's true.

1011
01:32:43,018 --> 01:32:46,470
Did one of those things
grow inside her?

1012
01:32:46,563 --> 01:32:49,137
I don't know, Newt.

1013
01:32:49,233 --> 01:32:51,391
That's the truth.

1014
01:32:51,485 --> 01:32:53,976
Isn't that how babies come?

1015
01:32:54,071 --> 01:32:56,147
I mean, people babies?

1016
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:59,940
- They grow inside you.
- No. That's very different.

1017
01:33:00,035 --> 01:33:01,992
Did you ever have a baby?

1018
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:03,573
Yes, I did.

1019
01:33:03,664 --> 01:33:05,158
I had a little girl.

1020
01:33:05,249 --> 01:33:07,206
Where is she?

1021
01:33:08,335 --> 01:33:09,829
She's gone.

1022
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,588
You mean dead.

1023
01:33:15,217 --> 01:33:16,676
Here.

1024
01:33:18,512 --> 01:33:20,172
Take this.

1025
01:33:20,848 --> 01:33:22,508
For luck.

1026
01:33:25,728 --> 01:33:27,804
How's that?

1027
01:33:30,024 --> 01:33:32,100
Don't go! Please!

1028
01:33:32,192 --> 01:33:34,862
Newt, I'm gonna be right
in the next room.

1029
01:33:35,612 --> 01:33:37,689
And you see that camera?

1030
01:33:37,781 --> 01:33:40,568
I can see you through
that camera ...

1031
01:33:40,659 --> 01:33:43,494
all the time, to see if you're safe.

1032
01:33:47,374 --> 01:33:50,292
I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.

1033
01:33:50,377 --> 01:33:52,002
I mean that.

1034
01:33:52,087 --> 01:33:54,044
That's a promise.

1035
01:33:54,131 --> 01:33:55,709
You promise?

1036
01:33:57,509 --> 01:33:59,169
I cross my heart.

1037
01:33:59,261 --> 01:34:00,969
And hope to die?

1038
01:34:01,055 --> 01:34:03,593
And hope to die.

1039
01:34:18,113 --> 01:34:19,857
Now go to sleep ...

1040
01:34:20,866 --> 01:34:22,942
and don't dream.

1041
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:28,498
Sneak.

1042
01:34:37,841 --> 01:34:42,384
The molecular acid oxidises after the
creature's death, completely neutralising.

1043
01:34:42,471 --> 01:34:45,674
Bishop, that's interesting,
but it gets us nowhere.

1044
01:34:45,766 --> 01:34:50,558
I'm trying to figure out what we're dealing
with here. Let's go through it again.

1045
01:34:50,646 --> 01:34:56,150
They grab the colonists and immobilise
them to be hosts for more of these.

1046
01:34:57,319 --> 01:35:00,735
So there would have to be
a lot of these parasites.

1047
01:35:00,823 --> 01:35:03,230
One for each colonist.
A hundred at least.

1048
01:35:03,325 --> 01:35:05,234
Yes, that follows.

1049
01:35:05,327 --> 01:35:09,159
Each one of these things
comes from an egg, right?

1050
01:35:11,792 --> 01:35:13,868
So who's laying these eggs?

1051
01:35:15,129 --> 01:35:19,043
I'm not sure. It must be
something we haven't seen yet.

1052
01:35:19,133 --> 01:35:21,624
Hey, maybe it's like an ant hive.

1053
01:35:21,719 --> 01:35:24,922
- Bees, man. Bees have hives.
- You know what I mean.

1054
01:35:25,014 --> 01:35:28,714
There's, like, one female
that runs the whole show.

1055
01:35:28,809 --> 01:35:31,181
- Yes. The queen.
- Yeah, the mama.

1056
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:34,057
And she's badass, man.
I mean big.

1057
01:35:34,148 --> 01:35:36,306
- These things ain't ants.
- I know that!

1058
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:42,105
Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed
as soon as you're finished with them.

1059
01:35:42,197 --> 01:35:47,987
Mr. Burke said they were to be kept alive
in stasis for return to the company labs.

1060
01:35:50,998 --> 01:35:53,370
He was very specific about it.

1061
01:35:53,459 --> 01:35:57,706
Those two specimens are worth millions
to the bio-weapons division.

1062
01:35:57,796 --> 01:36:01,331
If you're smart, we can both
come out of this heroes ...

1063
01:36:01,425 --> 01:36:03,963
and we will be set up for life.

1064
01:36:05,137 --> 01:36:07,842
You're crazy, Burke.
Do you know that?

1065
01:36:07,973 --> 01:36:12,552
You really think you can get a dangerous
organism like that past ICC quarantine?

1066
01:36:12,645 --> 01:36:15,764
How can they impound it
if they don't know about it?

1067
01:36:15,856 --> 01:36:18,561
But they will know about it,
Burke. From me.

1068
01:36:18,651 --> 01:36:23,111
Just like they'll know you were responsible
for the deaths of 157 colonists.

1069
01:36:23,197 --> 01:36:26,151
- Wait a second!
- You sent them to that ship.

1070
01:36:26,241 --> 01:36:31,662
I just checked the colony log: Directive
dated 6-12-79, signed Burke, Carter J.

1071
01:36:31,747 --> 01:36:36,124
You sent them out there
and you didn't even warn them.

1072
01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:40,504
What if that ship didn't even exist?
Did you think about that? I didn't know.

1073
01:36:40,589 --> 01:36:44,883
So now if I make a major security situation
out of it, everybody steps in ...

1074
01:36:44,968 --> 01:36:48,587
and there's no exclusive rights
for anybody. Nobody wins.

1075
01:36:48,681 --> 01:36:54,267
So I made a decision and it was wrong.
It was a bad call, Ripley. A bad call.

1076
01:36:54,353 --> 01:36:59,596
Bad call? These people are dead, Burke!
Have you any idea what you've done here!

1077
01:36:59,692 --> 01:37:02,609
I'm gonna make sure they nail
you right to the wall.

1078
01:37:02,695 --> 01:37:05,233
You won't sleaze your
way out of this one.

1079
01:37:05,322 --> 01:37:07,149
Right to the wall.

1080
01:37:08,951 --> 01:37:09,982
Ripley.

1081
01:37:12,162 --> 01:37:17,239
You know, I expected more from you.
I thought you'd be smarter than this.

1082
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:20,286
I'm happy to disappoint you.

1083
01:37:33,934 --> 01:37:36,010
What is it? What's going on?

1084
01:37:36,103 --> 01:37:37,597
- They're coming.
- Where?

1085
01:37:37,688 --> 01:37:39,230
In the tunnel.

1086
01:37:40,774 --> 01:37:42,019
Here we go.

1087
01:37:42,109 --> 01:37:44,647
A and B gun tracking and firing.

1088
01:37:44,737 --> 01:37:46,231
Multiple targets.

1089
01:37:52,036 --> 01:37:53,945
Look at those ammo counters go.

1090
01:37:56,582 --> 01:37:58,705
B gun's down 50 per cent.

1091
01:37:59,877 --> 01:38:02,165
It's a shooting gallery down there!

1092
01:38:06,091 --> 01:38:07,835
60 rounds left on B.

1093
01:38:07,926 --> 01:38:11,093
40 ... 20 ... 10.

1094
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:13,422
B gun's dry. 20 on A.

1095
01:38:14,683 --> 01:38:15,465
Ten ...

1096
01:38:15,559 --> 01:38:16,934
five ...

1097
01:38:20,898 --> 01:38:22,226
That's it.

1098
01:38:22,316 --> 01:38:25,483
Jesus! They're wall-to-wall in there.

1099
01:38:29,740 --> 01:38:31,649
They're at the pressure door.

1100
01:38:33,786 --> 01:38:35,280
Man, listen to that.

1101
01:38:35,371 --> 01:38:39,036
Bishop here. I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

1102
01:38:39,124 --> 01:38:40,951
Well, that's a switch!

1103
01:38:42,878 --> 01:38:46,377
It's very pretty, Bishop,
but what are we looking for?

1104
01:38:46,465 --> 01:38:49,585
That's it. Emergency venting.

1105
01:38:50,094 --> 01:38:54,423
That's beautiful, man.
That beats it all.

1106
01:38:54,515 --> 01:38:56,388
How long till it blows?

1107
01:38:56,558 --> 01:38:58,468
Four hours ...

1108
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:03,187
with a blast radius of 30 kilometres,
equal to about 40 megatons.

1109
01:39:04,274 --> 01:39:07,726
- We got problems.
- I don't fuckin' believe this!

1110
01:39:08,153 --> 01:39:10,146
Vasquez, close the shutters.

1111
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:12,528
Why can't we shut it down from here?

1112
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:17,446
The crash caused too much damage.
An overload was inevitable at this point.

1113
01:39:17,538 --> 01:39:22,247
Oh, man! And I was getting short!
Four more weeks and out.

1114
01:39:22,334 --> 01:39:25,834
- Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock!
- Give us a break!

1115
01:39:25,921 --> 01:39:28,495
Four more weeks. Oh, man!

1116
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:31,627
We need the other
drop-ship from the Sulaco.

1117
01:39:32,136 --> 01:39:34,840
Can't we bring it down on remote?

1118
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:38,465
How? The transmitter was on the APC!
It's wasted!

1119
01:39:38,559 --> 01:39:41,844
I don't care how, but we'd
better think of something!

1120
01:39:41,979 --> 01:39:44,731
Think of what?!
We're fucked! We're doomed!

1121
01:39:44,815 --> 01:39:49,477
Shut up! What about the colony transmitters?
The uplink tower at the other end?

1122
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:53,402
The hard-wiring between
here and there was damaged.

1123
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:55,530
We can't align the dish.

1124
01:39:55,617 --> 01:40:01,039
Somebody has to go out there. Take
a portable terminal and patch in manually.

1125
01:40:01,123 --> 01:40:06,200
Oh, yeah, sure! With those things
running around? You can count me out.

1126
01:40:06,295 --> 01:40:09,165
- We can count you out of everything.
- I'll go.

1127
01:40:09,256 --> 01:40:11,462
- Why don't you go, man?
- I'll go.

1128
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:13,626
- What?
- I'll go.

1129
01:40:13,719 --> 01:40:16,554
I'm the only one qualified
to remote-pilot the ship.

1130
01:40:16,638 --> 01:40:19,758
Yeah, right, man. Bishop should go.

1131
01:40:19,850 --> 01:40:21,013
Good idea!

1132
01:40:21,101 --> 01:40:23,260
Believe me, I'd prefer not to.

1133
01:40:23,354 --> 01:40:27,351
I may be synthetic,
but I'm not stupid.

1134
01:40:38,118 --> 01:40:39,945
How long?

1135
01:40:40,037 --> 01:40:43,406
This conduit runs almost
to the uplink assembly. 180 metres.

1136
01:40:43,499 --> 01:40:46,702
- Say 40 minutes to crawl down there ...
- Right.

1137
01:40:46,794 --> 01:40:50,626
an hour to patch in
and align the antenna ...

1138
01:40:51,882 --> 01:40:55,832
30 minutes to prep the ship,
and about 50 minutes flight time.

1139
01:40:55,928 --> 01:40:57,719
It's gonna be close.

1140
01:41:01,934 --> 01:41:04,472
- Good luck.
- See you soon.

1141
01:41:05,896 --> 01:41:07,723
Watch your fingers.

1142
01:41:11,902 --> 01:41:13,313
Vaya con Dios, man.

1143
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,076
This is unbelievable!

1144
01:41:28,168 --> 01:41:31,372
20 metres and closing. 15.

1145
01:41:31,463 --> 01:41:32,661
How many?

1146
01:41:32,756 --> 01:41:35,378
Can't tell. Lots.

1147
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:38,086
D gun's down 50 per cent.

1148
01:41:42,224 --> 01:41:45,391
C gun's right behind it.

1149
01:41:47,312 --> 01:41:50,479
It ain't stopping 'em.
It ain't stopping 'em!

1150
01:41:50,566 --> 01:41:52,854
150 rounds on D.

1151
01:41:52,943 --> 01:41:54,983
Come on, baby. Come on!

1152
01:41:55,404 --> 01:41:56,186
100 rounds.

1153
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:00,742
Come on, come on!

1154
01:42:05,706 --> 01:42:07,248
D gun's down to 20.

1155
01:42:08,709 --> 01:42:09,325
Ten.

1156
01:42:12,129 --> 01:42:13,588
Damn it!

1157
01:42:15,924 --> 01:42:16,422
Wait!

1158
01:42:16,508 --> 01:42:18,168
They're retreating.

1159
01:42:23,432 --> 01:42:26,137
The guns stopped them.

1160
01:42:28,437 --> 01:42:29,931
You're right.

1161
01:42:36,779 --> 01:42:39,270
Next time they walk
right up and knock.

1162
01:42:39,365 --> 01:42:41,523
Yeah, but they don't know that.

1163
01:42:41,659 --> 01:42:44,944
They're probably looking
for other ways to get in.

1164
01:42:45,037 --> 01:42:47,113
That'll take 'em a while.

1165
01:42:47,206 --> 01:42:49,697
- Maybe we got 'em demoralised.
- Shut up.

1166
01:42:51,210 --> 01:42:53,498
I want you two walking perimeter.

1167
01:42:55,089 --> 01:42:56,369
Move!

1168
01:43:03,972 --> 01:43:06,095
Hey, listen.

1169
01:43:06,183 --> 01:43:08,472
We're all in strung-out shape ...

1170
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,636
but stay frosty ...

1171
01:43:10,729 --> 01:43:12,805
and alert.

1172
01:43:13,899 --> 01:43:16,770
We can't afford to let
one of those bastards in here.

1173
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:20,276
All right. Vamonos.

1174
01:43:29,123 --> 01:43:31,958
How long's it been
since you got any sleep?

1175
01:43:32,042 --> 01:43:34,249
24 hours?

1176
01:43:35,838 --> 01:43:38,922
Hicks, I'm not gonna end
up like those others.

1177
01:43:39,341 --> 01:43:41,915
You'll take care of it, won't you?

1178
01:43:43,721 --> 01:43:48,050
If it comes to that,
I'll do us both.

1179
01:43:49,768 --> 01:43:54,098
Let's just make sure it doesn't
come to that, all right?

1180
01:43:54,189 --> 01:43:56,229
All right.

1181
01:43:56,859 --> 01:44:01,236
Hey, I want to introduce you
to a personal friend of mine.

1182
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:04,983
This is an M-41A pulse rifle,
10 millimetre ...

1183
01:44:05,075 --> 01:44:09,453
with an over-and-under 30 millimetre
pump-action grenade launcher.

1184
01:44:09,538 --> 01:44:11,495
Feel the weight.

1185
01:44:18,672 --> 01:44:20,712
OK. What do I do?

1186
01:44:26,096 --> 01:44:28,468
Pull it in tight here.

1187
01:44:28,557 --> 01:44:30,680
- Right.
- Lean into it.

1188
01:44:31,602 --> 01:44:33,808
All right, now it will kick some.

1189
01:44:34,855 --> 01:44:38,022
When the counter
reads zero here, you ...

1190
01:44:38,108 --> 01:44:40,350
- I press this up?
- That's right.

1191
01:44:42,446 --> 01:44:45,151
Get another one in quick.
Slap it in hard.

1192
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:48,028
- Right.
- Now you're ready to rock 'n' roll.

1193
01:44:48,577 --> 01:44:51,827
- What's this?
- The grenade launcher.

1194
01:44:51,914 --> 01:44:54,120
I don't think you want
to mess with that.

1195
01:44:54,208 --> 01:44:57,328
You started this.
Show me everything.

1196
01:44:58,128 --> 01:44:59,872
I can handle myself.

1197
01:45:02,132 --> 01:45:03,710
Yeah, I noticed.

1198
01:45:13,936 --> 01:45:15,893
How do you feel?

1199
01:45:15,979 --> 01:45:19,146
All right, I guess.
One hell of a hangover.

1200
01:45:20,901 --> 01:45:24,400
- Look, Ripley, I just want ...
- Forget it. Excuse me.

1201
01:46:19,001 --> 01:46:21,243
Shh, shh, shh.

1202
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:25,206
It's OK. It's OK.

1203
01:47:35,452 --> 01:47:38,619
Newt. Wake up.

1204
01:47:38,706 --> 01:47:40,615
- What?
- Be quiet.

1205
01:47:40,708 --> 01:47:42,784
We're in trouble.

1206
01:48:00,561 --> 01:48:03,515
Agh!

1207
01:48:03,605 --> 01:48:05,681
Move, Newt!

1208
01:48:26,587 --> 01:48:27,536
Hey!

1209
01:48:36,513 --> 01:48:38,173
Help!

1210
01:48:39,099 --> 01:48:40,926
Help!

1211
01:48:41,352 --> 01:48:42,431
Hicks!

1212
01:48:43,354 --> 01:48:44,848
Say again, Bishop?

1213
01:48:44,938 --> 01:48:48,272
You've got it into auto-refuel mode
and it's sequencing right?

1214
01:48:48,359 --> 01:48:49,734
That's right.

1215
01:48:49,818 --> 01:48:51,443
Good. Stay on it.

1216
01:48:52,363 --> 01:48:56,028
Get back to me when you've
activated the launch cycle.

1217
01:48:56,909 --> 01:48:59,826
- He's at the uplink tower.
- Terrific.

1218
01:49:03,457 --> 01:49:06,826
- Hicks! Hicks!
- Help! Help!

1219
01:49:06,919 --> 01:49:08,461
Hicks! Help us!

1220
01:49:08,545 --> 01:49:10,170
Break the glass!

1221
01:49:10,255 --> 01:49:12,544
Break it, break it!

1222
01:49:12,633 --> 01:49:14,293
I'll try.

1223
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:37,485
Ripley, I'm scared.

1224
01:49:38,283 --> 01:49:39,315
Me, too.

1225
01:49:45,165 --> 01:49:46,446
Stay here.

1226
01:49:59,763 --> 01:50:01,839
It's the med lab. Hudson!

1227
01:50:01,932 --> 01:50:04,968
Vasquez! Meet me in med lab!
We got a fire!

1228
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:07,136
We're on our way.

1229
01:50:10,232 --> 01:50:12,984
They're coming, Newt.

1230
01:50:19,783 --> 01:50:20,400
Urgh!

1231
01:50:27,583 --> 01:50:29,042
Aagh!

1232
01:50:45,059 --> 01:50:46,885
Shoot it out!

1233
01:50:50,898 --> 01:50:52,807
- Hudson!
- Jesus!

1234
01:50:54,735 --> 01:50:55,731
Oh!

1235
01:50:56,362 --> 01:50:58,687
Christ, kid, look out!

1236
01:51:19,426 --> 01:51:20,755
- Over there!
- Yeah!

1237
01:51:20,886 --> 01:51:22,049
- Ready?
- Yeah!

1238
01:51:27,267 --> 01:51:28,512
Hudson!

1239
01:51:28,602 --> 01:51:30,844
Yeah, all clear.
Nailed the other one.

1240
01:51:30,938 --> 01:51:32,515
It's history, man.

1241
01:51:33,774 --> 01:51:34,805
Jesus!

1242
01:51:36,819 --> 01:51:39,736
Burke. It was Burke.

1243
01:51:42,533 --> 01:51:45,902
I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch right now.

1244
01:51:45,994 --> 01:51:48,746
It just doesn't make
any goddamn sense.

1245
01:51:51,834 --> 01:51:55,783
He figured that he could get an
alien back through quarantine ...

1246
01:51:55,921 --> 01:51:58,839
if one of us was impregnated.

1247
01:51:58,924 --> 01:52:01,130
Whatever you call it.

1248
01:52:02,011 --> 01:52:05,011
And then frozen for the trip home.

1249
01:52:05,097 --> 01:52:09,426
Nobody would know about
the embryos we were carrying ...

1250
01:52:09,518 --> 01:52:11,261
me and Newt.

1251
01:52:13,105 --> 01:52:15,062
Wait, now. We'd all know.

1252
01:52:15,149 --> 01:52:20,819
Yes. He could only do it by sabotaging
certain freezers on the way home.

1253
01:52:20,904 --> 01:52:22,363
Namely, yours.

1254
01:52:22,448 --> 01:52:27,738
Then he could jettison the bodies
and make up any story he liked.

1255
01:52:27,828 --> 01:52:30,070
Fuck! He's dead.

1256
01:52:31,373 --> 01:52:33,449
You're dog meat, pal.

1257
01:52:34,251 --> 01:52:38,913
This is so nuts. I mean, listen ...
Listen to what you're saying.

1258
01:52:39,298 --> 01:52:42,714
It's paranoid delusion.
It's really sad.

1259
01:52:44,428 --> 01:52:46,136
It's pathetic.

1260
01:52:46,221 --> 01:52:49,388
Burke, I don't know
which species is worse.

1261
01:52:49,475 --> 01:52:53,424
They don't fuck each other over
for a goddamn percentage.

1262
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:56,640
All right, we waste him.
No offence.

1263
01:52:56,732 --> 01:52:58,725
No! He's got to go back ...

1264
01:52:59,568 --> 01:53:01,644
They cut the power.

1265
01:53:01,737 --> 01:53:04,821
How can they cut the power?
They're animals!

1266
01:53:04,907 --> 01:53:07,824
I want you two checking
the corridors! Move!

1267
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:10,697
Gorman, watch Burke.
Newt, stay close.

1268
01:53:14,208 --> 01:53:17,327
- I'll go this side.
- You do that, man.

1269
01:53:42,194 --> 01:53:44,981
- Anything?
- There's something.

1270
01:53:45,072 --> 01:53:48,275
It's inside the complex.

1271
01:53:48,367 --> 01:53:50,324
You're just reading me.

1272
01:53:50,411 --> 01:53:53,281
No, it ain't you.

1273
01:53:55,290 --> 01:53:58,825
They're inside the perimeter.
They're in here.

1274
01:53:58,919 --> 01:54:02,039
Hudson, stay cool. Vasquez?

1275
01:54:07,803 --> 01:54:11,006
Hudson may be right.

1276
01:54:11,098 --> 01:54:14,218
- Get back, both of you.
- The signal's weird.

1277
01:54:15,686 --> 01:54:20,264
Must be some interference or something.
There's movement all over the place!

1278
01:54:20,357 --> 01:54:23,726
Get back to Operations.
It's game time.

1279
01:54:23,819 --> 01:54:25,064
Newt.

1280
01:54:27,531 --> 01:54:29,524
Seal the door.

1281
01:54:29,616 --> 01:54:30,648
Hurry!

1282
01:54:30,743 --> 01:54:34,076
Come on! Come on, get back!

1283
01:54:34,163 --> 01:54:36,155
Work fast.

1284
01:54:39,501 --> 01:54:42,668
Cover your eyes, Newt.
Don't look at the light.

1285
01:54:42,755 --> 01:54:47,132
Movement. Signal's clean.
Range: 20 metres.

1286
01:54:47,217 --> 01:54:50,005
They found a way in,
something we missed.

1287
01:54:50,095 --> 01:54:52,004
We didn't miss anything.

1288
01:54:52,097 --> 01:54:53,757
18 ...

1289
01:54:53,849 --> 01:54:55,842
17 metres.

1290
01:54:55,934 --> 01:54:58,852
Something under the floor,
not in the plans.

1291
01:54:58,937 --> 01:55:00,515
- 15 metres.
- Ripley!

1292
01:55:00,606 --> 01:55:02,563
Definitely inside the barricades.

1293
01:55:02,649 --> 01:55:04,108
Let's go!

1294
01:55:05,736 --> 01:55:10,362
- That's right outside the door. Get back!
- This is a big fuckin' signal.

1295
01:55:10,449 --> 01:55:13,699
- How you doing, Vasquez?
- Almost there.

1296
01:55:15,287 --> 01:55:16,829
That's it.

1297
01:55:17,748 --> 01:55:19,372
12 metres.

1298
01:55:19,917 --> 01:55:21,577
11 ...

1299
01:55:22,002 --> 01:55:23,033
10 ...

1300
01:55:23,128 --> 01:55:25,999
- They're right on us.
- 9 metres.

1301
01:55:26,090 --> 01:55:29,423
- Remember, short controlled bursts.
- 8 metres.

1302
01:55:32,096 --> 01:55:33,887
7 ...

1303
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:36,255
6 ...

1304
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:39,600
- That can't be! That's inside the room.
- It's reading right, man! Look!

1305
01:55:39,687 --> 01:55:41,229
Well, you're not reading it right.

1306
01:55:43,774 --> 01:55:46,146
5 metres, man ¡X 4!

1307
01:55:46,694 --> 01:55:48,770
What the hell!

1308
01:55:51,031 --> 01:55:54,649
- Oh, my God!
- Give me the light!

1309
01:56:12,970 --> 01:56:14,761
There they go! Over there!
Get 'em!

1310
01:56:16,807 --> 01:56:19,476
- Come on!
- Get 'em!

1311
01:56:20,519 --> 01:56:22,725
Do something, Gorman!

1312
01:56:24,314 --> 01:56:27,648
Look out! Look out!
There's more of 'em!

1313
01:56:27,735 --> 01:56:29,443
Get to medical!

1314
01:56:30,112 --> 01:56:31,690
Do it! Now!

1315
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:33,856
Hudson! Look out!

1316
01:56:37,786 --> 01:56:38,652
Aagh!

1317
01:56:39,413 --> 01:56:40,444
Now!

1318
01:56:42,499 --> 01:56:43,246
Burke!

1319
01:56:46,545 --> 01:56:49,831
Open this door! Burke! Open it!

1320
01:56:50,591 --> 01:56:51,540
Agh!

1321
01:56:51,675 --> 01:56:54,213
Let's go! Let's go! Fall back!

1322
01:56:57,306 --> 01:56:58,136
Go!

1323
01:56:58,390 --> 01:57:01,177
Die, motherfucker!

1324
01:57:01,268 --> 01:57:02,643
Burke!

1325
01:57:02,728 --> 01:57:04,056
Hudson!

1326
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:06,309
Hudson!

1327
01:57:06,398 --> 01:57:07,774
Motherfucker!

1328
01:57:07,858 --> 01:57:10,610
Come on! Come on!
Come and get it, baby!

1329
01:57:11,278 --> 01:57:15,110
I don't got all day!
Come on, you bastard!

1330
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:18,650
Come on, you too!
You want some of this? Fuck you!

1331
01:57:19,661 --> 01:57:20,776
Aagh!

1332
01:57:21,246 --> 01:57:23,204
Fuck you!

1333
01:57:24,124 --> 01:57:25,666
- Hicks!
- Hudson!

1334
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:36,219
Come on, Hicks!

1335
01:57:36,303 --> 01:57:37,334
Go!

1336
01:57:37,429 --> 01:57:38,840
It's locked!

1337
01:57:57,449 --> 01:57:59,323
Got it! Let's go!

1338
01:57:59,993 --> 01:58:01,156
Go! Go!

1339
01:58:03,789 --> 01:58:05,069
Move, Gorman!

1340
01:58:05,165 --> 01:58:06,624
Seal it!

1341
01:58:07,710 --> 01:58:08,908
Burke!

1342
01:58:09,002 --> 01:58:11,375
Goddamn you! Open this door!

1343
01:58:23,976 --> 01:58:24,640
Get back!

1344
01:58:24,727 --> 01:58:27,182
- Hurry up!
- Gorman, get out of the way!

1345
01:58:27,271 --> 01:58:29,347
- Ripley, this way!
- What?

1346
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:32,016
Wait. Get behind me.

1347
01:58:32,109 --> 01:58:34,517
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast!

1348
01:58:37,531 --> 01:58:40,366
- Hicks!
- Come on, let's go!

1349
01:58:42,202 --> 01:58:43,531
Move!

1350
01:58:50,169 --> 01:58:53,039
- Which way to the landing field?
- This way.

1351
01:58:58,469 --> 01:59:00,129
Go right!

1352
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:05,641
This way! This way.

1353
01:59:14,276 --> 01:59:17,727
- Which way?
- Straight ahead and left.

1354
01:59:17,821 --> 01:59:21,190
Bishop, do you read me?
Come in. Over.

1355
01:59:21,283 --> 01:59:23,359
The ship is on its way.

1356
01:59:23,452 --> 01:59:26,536
ETA 16 minutes.

1357
01:59:26,622 --> 01:59:29,409
Good! Stand by there!
We're on our way!

1358
01:59:40,636 --> 01:59:42,794
- Which way now?
- That way.

1359
01:59:42,888 --> 01:59:45,806
- No, wait! This way!
- Are you sure?

1360
01:59:47,351 --> 01:59:48,893
Vasquez, move!

1361
01:59:51,772 --> 01:59:54,975
- Right up here! It's just up here!
- Hicks!

1362
01:59:55,067 --> 01:59:57,143
We're almost there!

1363
01:59:57,736 --> 01:59:59,812
Newt, wait!

1364
02:00:00,072 --> 02:00:01,270
Newt!

1365
02:00:26,056 --> 02:00:27,301
Vasquez!

1366
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:29,632
Go!

1367
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:34,307
Ohh! Ohh, no!

1368
02:00:46,869 --> 02:00:47,900
Newt!

1369
02:00:47,995 --> 02:00:51,364
Up there! There's a
short cut across the roof!

1370
02:00:52,499 --> 02:00:53,531
Hicks!

1371
02:01:02,926 --> 02:01:05,085
You always were an asshole, Gorman.

1372
02:01:22,571 --> 02:01:24,647
Newt!

1373
02:01:24,740 --> 02:01:27,148
- Ripley!
- Newt!

1374
02:01:28,077 --> 02:01:31,243
Hicks! Hicks, get her! Hurry!

1375
02:01:34,666 --> 02:01:36,992
Oh! Hold on, Newt!

1376
02:01:37,086 --> 02:01:39,292
- I'm slipping!
- Don't let go!

1377
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:41,456
- Ripley!
- Hold on!

1378
02:01:41,548 --> 02:01:43,541
- Help!
- Gotcha!

1379
02:01:44,551 --> 02:01:45,631
I gotcha!

1380
02:01:49,264 --> 02:01:51,969
Newt! No!

1381
02:01:55,145 --> 02:01:58,146
Come on!
We can find her with this!

1382
02:01:58,232 --> 02:01:59,809
Stay where you are, Newt!

1383
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:02,771
- Ripley!
- We're coming!

1384
02:02:14,331 --> 02:02:16,573
Ripley!

1385
02:02:20,629 --> 02:02:22,123
This way.

1386
02:02:23,674 --> 02:02:25,548
She's close.

1387
02:02:25,634 --> 02:02:27,461
Newt!

1388
02:02:29,930 --> 02:02:32,006
Ripley!

1389
02:02:32,099 --> 02:02:34,555
Where are you! Can you hear me!

1390
02:02:35,728 --> 02:02:38,978
- Newt!
- Here! I'm here!

1391
02:02:39,064 --> 02:02:40,179
Where?!

1392
02:02:45,195 --> 02:02:47,271
Newt, are you OK?

1393
02:02:47,364 --> 02:02:49,986
Gonna have to cut it.

1394
02:02:50,075 --> 02:02:53,658
Climb down, honey.
We've got to cut through.

1395
02:03:01,670 --> 02:03:02,749
Newt?

1396
02:03:02,838 --> 02:03:05,755
Now don't move. Stay very still.

1397
02:03:05,841 --> 02:03:08,213
OK.

1398
02:03:08,302 --> 02:03:10,971
We're almost there.
Hang in there, OK?

1399
02:03:18,062 --> 02:03:19,935
Hicks! Hurry!

1400
02:03:20,022 --> 02:03:21,516
- I know!
- I mean it!

1401
02:03:36,121 --> 02:03:38,078
Newt, just stay still!

1402
02:03:42,127 --> 02:03:43,206
Aagh!

1403
02:03:43,295 --> 02:03:45,169
- Almost there!
- No!

1404
02:03:47,674 --> 02:03:48,706
Newt!

1405
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:03,138
No! No!

1406
02:04:03,232 --> 02:04:05,723
- Let's go!
- No!

1407
02:04:06,443 --> 02:04:09,361
They don't kill you!
They don't kill you! They ...

1408
02:04:10,072 --> 02:04:14,283
- She's alive! She's alive!
- All right! I believe you! She's alive!

1409
02:04:14,368 --> 02:04:16,444
We've got to go! Now!

1410
02:04:47,443 --> 02:04:48,641
Hicks ...

1411
02:04:48,736 --> 02:04:50,527
Get it off!

1412
02:04:50,612 --> 02:04:51,941
Aagh!

1413
02:04:52,031 --> 02:04:54,319
Get it off!

1414
02:04:54,408 --> 02:04:55,902
Aagh!

1415
02:05:02,458 --> 02:05:04,035
Here!

1416
02:05:08,547 --> 02:05:09,745
Go!

1417
02:05:13,093 --> 02:05:15,382
Come on, you can make it!

1418
02:05:38,619 --> 02:05:41,822
Bishop! How much time?!

1419
02:05:41,914 --> 02:05:43,953
Plenty! 26 minutes!

1420
02:05:44,041 --> 02:05:46,532
- We're not leaving!
- We're not?

1421
02:07:11,587 --> 02:07:15,667
- Ripley ...
- Bishop, she's alive. There's still time.

1422
02:07:15,758 --> 02:07:19,209
In 19 minutes this area
is gonna be a cloud of vapour.

1423
02:07:19,303 --> 02:07:22,138
- Hicks, don't let him leave.
- We ain't going anywhere.

1424
02:07:24,558 --> 02:07:27,642
- See you, Hicks.
- Dwayne.

1425
02:07:29,313 --> 02:07:30,511
It's Dwayne.

1426
02:07:32,232 --> 02:07:34,190
Ellen.

1427
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:37,897
Don't be gone long, Ellen.

1428
02:07:44,995 --> 02:07:47,949
Attention. Emergency.

1429
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:51,872
All personnel must
evacuate immediately.

1430
02:07:52,628 --> 02:07:58,748
You now have 15 minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

1431
02:08:43,804 --> 02:08:48,265
Attention. Emergency.

1432
02:08:48,350 --> 02:08:51,019
All personnel must
evacuate immediately.

1433
02:08:52,062 --> 02:08:57,139
You now have 14 minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

1434
02:12:37,579 --> 02:12:39,122
Ripley!

1435
02:12:39,623 --> 02:12:40,868
Ripley!

1436
02:12:55,264 --> 02:12:57,506
Grab on to me!

1437
02:12:57,599 --> 02:12:59,473
Hold on!

1438
02:16:50,374 --> 02:16:52,450
Let's go!

1439
02:16:55,379 --> 02:16:57,870
Behind us!

1440
02:17:48,891 --> 02:17:54,763
Attention. Emergency. All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1441
02:17:57,274 --> 02:18:03,526
Attention. Emergency. All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1442
02:18:04,156 --> 02:18:09,197
You now have four minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

1443
02:18:24,968 --> 02:18:27,424
Come on, goddamn it!

1444
02:18:32,643 --> 02:18:34,719
Hold on to me!

1445
02:19:25,112 --> 02:19:30,319
Attention. Emergency. All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1446
02:19:32,119 --> 02:19:35,986
You now have two minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

1447
02:19:44,298 --> 02:19:45,329
No!

1448
02:19:48,385 --> 02:19:49,548
Bishop!

1449
02:19:49,636 --> 02:19:51,510
Goddamn you!

1450
02:20:55,327 --> 02:20:57,403
Close your eyes, baby.

1451
02:20:59,915 --> 02:21:01,955
Look!

1452
02:21:08,757 --> 02:21:10,833
Come on! Come on!

1453
02:21:39,246 --> 02:21:40,621
Punch it, Bishop!

1454
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:27,992
It's OK.

1455
02:22:28,087 --> 02:22:29,747
We're OK.

1456
02:22:38,764 --> 02:22:40,044
Hey.

1457
02:22:42,226 --> 02:22:44,302
We made it.

1458
02:22:44,478 --> 02:22:46,554
I knew you'd come.

1459
02:23:01,203 --> 02:23:03,279
He's gonna be all right.

1460
02:23:03,372 --> 02:23:06,990
He's just out. I had to give him
another shot for the pain.

1461
02:23:07,084 --> 02:23:10,085
We need a stretcher
to carry him up to medical.

1462
02:23:10,170 --> 02:23:11,830
OK.

1463
02:23:16,885 --> 02:23:21,013
I'm sorry if I scared you. That
platform was becoming too unstable.

1464
02:23:21,098 --> 02:23:25,261
I had to circle and hope that things
didn't get too rough to take you off.

1465
02:23:25,352 --> 02:23:26,846
Bishop ...

1466
02:23:27,688 --> 02:23:30,309
- You did OK.
- I did?

1467
02:23:30,399 --> 02:23:31,727
Oh, yeah.

1468
02:24:11,148 --> 02:24:13,354
Go! Move!

1469
02:24:15,778 --> 02:24:18,981
No! Here! Here!

1470
02:24:20,449 --> 02:24:21,065
Run!

1471
02:24:26,330 --> 02:24:27,954
Here!

1472
02:25:56,670 --> 02:25:58,959
Get away from her, you bitch!

1473
02:26:22,071 --> 02:26:24,608
Come on! Come on!

1474
02:27:32,057 --> 02:27:33,255
Aagh!

1475
02:27:37,229 --> 02:27:37,893
Aagh!

1476
02:27:46,572 --> 02:27:47,236
Aagh!

1477
02:27:53,036 --> 02:27:53,985
Ripley!

1478
02:28:31,700 --> 02:28:33,907
Ohh!

1479
02:28:33,994 --> 02:28:34,990
Aagh!

1480
02:29:06,902 --> 02:29:09,393
Bishop!

1481
02:29:55,951 --> 02:29:58,240
- Mommy!
- Oh, God!

1482
02:30:01,790 --> 02:30:04,993
Not bad for a ... human.

1483
02:30:52,341 --> 02:30:55,128
Are we gonna sleep
all the way home?

1484
02:30:55,219 --> 02:30:56,677
All the way home.

1485
02:30:56,762 --> 02:30:58,221
Can I dream?

1486
02:31:00,307 --> 02:31:03,142
Yes, honey. I think we both can.

1487
02:31:10,776 --> 02:31:12,436
Sleep tight.

1488
02:31:12,528 --> 02:31:14,188
Affirmative.
