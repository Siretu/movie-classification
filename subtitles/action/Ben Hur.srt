1
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:14,340
In the year of our Lord...

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,220
...Judea, for nearly a century,
had lain under the mastery of Rome.

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,021
In the seventh year of the reign
ofAugustus Caesar...

4
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:24,581
...an imperial decree
ordered every Judean...

5
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:27,141
...each to return
to his place of birth...

6
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:29,541
... to be counted and taxed.

7
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:34,261
Converging ways of many of them led
to their capital city, Jerusalem...

8
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:37,381
... the troubled heart of their land.

9
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:40,982
The old city was dominated
by the fortress ofAntonia...

10
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:42,502
... the seat of Roman power...

11
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:44,742
...and by the great golden temple...

12
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:49,022
... the outward sign of
an inward and imperishable faith.

13
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,782
Even while they obeyed
the will of Caesar...

14
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:56,022
... the people clung proudly
to their ancient heritage...

15
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,102
...always remembering
the promise of their prophets...

16
00:00:59,343 --> 00:01:02,463
... that one day there would be
born among them a redeemer...

17
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:06,103
... to bring them salvation
and perfect freedom.

18
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:17,383
You'll be counted at Hebron.

19
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:18,504
-Name?
-Samuel.

20
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:19,824
-What city?
-Joppa.

21
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:21,384
-What family?
-Michael.

22
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:23,344
-Move on. Move on.
-Yes.

23
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,064
-Name?
-Joseph.

24
00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:26,744
-What city?
-Nazareth.

25
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:29,264
-What family?
-David of Bethlehem.

26
00:01:29,504 --> 00:01:30,624
And the woman?

27
00:01:31,104 --> 00:01:31,984
My wife.

28
00:01:32,184 --> 00:01:34,544
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.

29
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:37,105
Come on, come on.

30
00:07:42,644 --> 00:07:44,084
What village is this?

31
00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:45,444
Nazareth.

32
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:48,564
We should arrive in Jerusalem
tomorrow night.

33
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:09,686
You're not watching
the soldiers, Joseph?

34
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:12,046
We've seen Romans before.

35
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:13,286
Yes. . .

36
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:16,366
. . .and we will see them again.

37
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:22,206
My table is not finished.

38
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:23,886
Where is your son?

39
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:26,326
He's walking in the hills.

40
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:31,007
He neglects his work, Joseph.

41
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,527
No.

42
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:37,047
Once, I reproached him with
forgetting his work. He said to me:

43
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:39,847
"I must be about my father's business. "

44
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,447
Then why isn't he here, working?

45
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,008
He's working.

46
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,210
Trumpeters of the legion!

47
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:55,051
Welcome, Messala.

48
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:56,851
The command is yours.

49
00:09:57,171 --> 00:09:58,371
Thank you.

50
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:01,292
Thank you for relieving me.

51
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,772
Drusus. . .

52
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:17,852
. . .when I was a boy, I dreamed
of commanding this garrison.

53
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:22,573
Now the wheel has turned.

54
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:25,093
I am in command.

55
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:35,373
Attention!

56
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:40,454
Aisle one, face right!

57
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,734
Forward!

58
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:52,054
I'd forgotten the heat.

59
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:54,254
If it were only the heat.

60
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:58,215
I lived here until I was 1 4.
Jerusalem was my home.

61
00:10:58,415 --> 00:11:00,775
-My father was head of--
-Yes, I know.

62
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:04,415
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.

63
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:08,055
If there can be such a thing
in this forsaken land.

64
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:13,015
If you want to rise, Sextus,
do the difficult.

65
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:16,016
I asked to be sent here.

66
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:20,096
You'll find the people changed
since you were a boy.

67
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:21,896
In what way?

68
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:26,136
Oh, won't pay their taxes,
an irrational resentment of Rome. . . .

69
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:29,616
There's nothing new in all that.

70
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:33,497
And then there's religion. I tell
you, they're drunk with religion.

71
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:37,497
They smash the statues of our gods,
even those of the emperor.

72
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:39,777
Punish them.

73
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:43,497
We do.

74
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:46,177
When we can find them.

75
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:48,937
Find the leaders.

76
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:52,378
You don't know. There's nothing
you can put your finger on.

77
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,858
There are strange forces
at work here.

78
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:56,498
This "messiah" business--

79
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:59,258
I know. There was one
predicted when I was a boy.

80
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:04,138
A king of the Jews, who will lead them
into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.

81
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:05,778
Makes your head spin.

82
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,738
There's a wild man
in the desert named John. . .

83
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,859
. . .who drowns people in water.

84
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:14,819
And a carpenter's son who does magic
tricks. "Miracles" they call them.

85
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:17,379
There's always a rabble-rouser
stirring up trouble.

86
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:19,739
No, no, no. This man is different.

87
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:23,419
He teaches that God is near,
in every man.

88
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:28,379
It's actually quite profound,
some of it.

89
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,100
You've been too long away from Rome.

90
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,740
Go back, Sextus.

91
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,260
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea. . .

92
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,540
. . .and forget that
God is in every man.

93
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,540
-There is divinity in only one man.
-Yes, I know.

94
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,180
The emperor is displeased.

95
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,221
He wishes Judea made into a more
obedient and disciplined province.

96
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:53,501
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.

97
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:58,061
How? You can break a man's skull,
arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.

98
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:01,341
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?

99
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,301
Especially a new idea.

100
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:10,662
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.

101
00:13:11,702 --> 00:13:12,982
I assume he has a name.

102
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:17,182
-He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
-Then treat him like one!

103
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:21,622
Tell him I will join him.

104
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:23,982
Yes, tribune.

105
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:26,023
Centurion!

106
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:35,023
This was his country
before it was ours.

107
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:36,543
Don't forget that.

108
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:39,343
Yes, tribune.

109
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,944
Very wise. This Ben-Hur is
the richest man in Jerusalem.

110
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:51,384
And the head of one
of the greatest families in Judea.

111
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,464
We were friends as boys.

112
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:55,664
We were like brothers.

113
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,104
Sextus. . .

114
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:02,985
. . .you ask how to fight an idea.

115
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:05,105
Well, I'll tell you how.

116
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:08,185
With another idea.

117
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:47,147
I said I'd come back.

118
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,387
I never thought you would.

119
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:53,707
I'm so glad.

120
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,748
-Look at you.
-Look at you!

121
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:07,068
You've come back a tribune.

122
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,148
When I heard that news,
I drank a toast to you.

123
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:13,628
We'll drink another now.

124
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,628
-Your sister and mother?
-They're fine.

125
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:19,629
They've talked of you
ever since we knew you were coming.

126
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,149
-Is Tirzah married?
-No.

127
00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:23,989
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.

128
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,549
She's been in love with you
since she was 5.

129
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:28,789
I can't wait to see them.

130
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,429
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?

131
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:34,309
Or have you become too dignified?

132
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,671
-Down Eros, up Mars!
-Down Eros, up Mars!

133
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:05,071
Where the beams cross?

134
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:19,512
Good.

135
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,353
After all these years!

136
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:42,193
Still close.

137
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:43,993
In every way.

138
00:16:46,753 --> 00:16:48,193
I hope so.

139
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:51,034
I know.

140
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:55,994
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew. . .

141
00:16:57,354 --> 00:16:58,834
. . .whose life you once saved.

142
00:17:00,594 --> 00:17:02,474
The best thing I ever did.

143
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:08,154
Judah. . .

144
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:12,675
. . .it will be very difficult
to govern here.

145
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,435
I'm going to need help.

146
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,355
Your help. Your advice.

147
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:24,595
-You want my advice?
-Yes, I do.

148
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,076
Withdraw your legions.

149
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:31,876
Give us our freedom.

150
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:38,356
Unfortunately, the emperor
is devoted to his empire.

151
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:40,756
He's particularly fond of Judea.

152
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:43,676
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.

153
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:47,317
Is there anything so sad
as unrequited love?

154
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,157
My quarters.

155
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:56,517
A bit grim.

156
00:17:56,717 --> 00:17:58,117
Not grim.

157
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:00,757
Austere. Virtuous.

158
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:02,397
Roman.

159
00:18:06,598 --> 00:18:10,918
I'm going to be second-in-command
to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.

160
00:18:11,278 --> 00:18:13,318
He's coming in a few days
with more legions.

161
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:17,398
Then the rumors are true.

162
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:23,399
The emperor does not approve
of your countrymen.

163
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,359
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.

164
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,639
But you and your family
need have no concern.

165
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,519
I'm next in authority to the governor,
and you're my friend.

166
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:40,599
-I'm a Jew.
-Ah, you are like a Roman!

167
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,160
What have you in common
with the troublemaking rabble?

168
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,600
-They're my people. I'm one of them.
-Be wise, Judah.

169
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,720
It's a Roman world. If you want to
live in it, you must become part of it.

170
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,640
You've changed.

171
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,240
I've grown up. I've seen the world
since I left Jerusalem.

172
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,041
I've seen Rome. It's no accident
that one small village on the Tiber. . .

173
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,881
. . .was chosen to rule the world.

174
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:04,721
Your legions.

175
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:08,601
It wasn't just our legions.

176
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:13,121
Other countries have armies,
fine armies. I know, I fought them.

177
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,361
Oh, no.

178
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:19,522
No, it was fate that chose us
to civilize the world. And we have.

179
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:22,642
Our roads and ships connect
every corner of the earth.

180
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:26,162
Roman law, architecture, literature
are the glory of the human race.

181
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:28,642
I believe in the future of my people.

182
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:32,402
Of course you do.
And you can help them.

183
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:34,762
How?

184
00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:37,202
You're an aristocrat.

185
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,643
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.

186
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:43,403
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.

187
00:19:43,603 --> 00:19:45,963
They'd listen if you
spoke out against rebellion.

188
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:49,403
Persuade your people that
their resistance to Rome is stupid.

189
00:19:49,603 --> 00:19:51,883
It is worse than stupid, futile!

190
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,443
For it can end in only one way,
extinction for your people!

191
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:03,604
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.

192
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,324
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.

193
00:20:06,524 --> 00:20:07,844
Then we're agreed!

194
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:11,884
Now, when can I come
to see your family?

195
00:20:13,604 --> 00:20:16,445
-We had hoped tomorrow.
-Good.

196
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,245
And now for our toast.

197
00:20:23,165 --> 00:20:25,165
It's dreadful wine, by the way.

198
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:28,685
It's especially fermented
for the Roman army.

199
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:31,685
You're very cruel to your conquerors.

200
00:20:36,406 --> 00:20:38,446
It's an insane world.

201
00:20:39,846 --> 00:20:42,206
But in it there is one sanity:

202
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:45,206
The loyalty of old friends.

203
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:49,726
Judah, we must believe in one another.

204
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:52,086
Will you drink to that?

205
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,767
With all my heart.

206
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:19,368
Here it is, the place I've remembered.

207
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:22,208
The court where we played
at changing the guard.

208
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:26,488
The roof where we'd throw pebbles
at people in the street and then hide.

209
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:29,929
-We were rascals, weren't we?
-No, you were good boys.

210
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,129
I would have that time again.

211
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:34,689
And here it is. Nothing has changed.

212
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:36,289
Except for the fountain.

213
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:40,489
-The old well would go dry, remember?
-Promptly, every summer.

214
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:45,249
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.

215
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:48,850
-He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
-No?

216
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,450
Of course he has. He was a boy
when he left us, now he's a man.

217
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,850
With great responsibilities.

218
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,130
Come.

219
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,450
The emperor builds and builds,
turning brick to marble.

220
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,530
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.

221
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:13,371
I've never seen anything
like this before. It's beautiful!

222
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:16,451
-Is it Roman?
-It's Libyan. I was there last year.

223
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:18,131
A tremendous campaign.

224
00:22:18,331 --> 00:22:21,611
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.

225
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:24,931
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.

226
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:26,932
Or was, till we destroyed it.

227
00:22:29,132 --> 00:22:30,812
Now it's nothing but ashes.

228
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,172
I'm boring you with soldier stories.

229
00:22:36,052 --> 00:22:39,132
Come with me, there's something
I want to show you.

230
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:41,212
Thank you for this.

231
00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:45,173
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.

232
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,733
What do you think of it?

233
00:23:03,254 --> 00:23:04,734
Magnificent.

234
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:10,014
It's Arabic.

235
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:13,494
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.

236
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,294
Let me try him sometime.

237
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,854
Whenever you like. He's yours.

238
00:23:21,054 --> 00:23:22,775
Do you mean you'll give me this?

239
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,015
Oh, Judah.

240
00:23:26,815 --> 00:23:30,575
You are good. It's going
to be like old times, I know it.

241
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,215
Judah, tell me, did you. . .

242
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:41,296
. . .think about what I said?

243
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:44,096
Yes. Talked to a number
of people already.

244
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:46,896
Spoken against violence,
against incidents.

245
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:48,896
Most of the men agree with me.

246
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,016
Most? Not all?

247
00:23:51,736 --> 00:23:53,016
No, not all.

248
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:54,416
Who does not agree?

249
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:58,416
Well, the resentful, the impatient.

250
00:23:58,616 --> 00:23:59,577
Who are they?

251
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:05,577
Yes, Judah. Who are they?

252
00:24:12,337 --> 00:24:15,097
Would I retain your friendship
if I became an informer?

253
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:17,338
Telling the names of criminals
is not informing.

254
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:20,298
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.

255
00:24:20,498 --> 00:24:21,938
Patriots?!

256
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:33,258
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.

257
00:24:34,178 --> 00:24:38,459
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.

258
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:41,459
This is my great opportunity,
and yours too.

259
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:44,019
If I bring order here,
I can have any post I want.

260
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:47,419
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?

261
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,499
Rome! Yes, perhaps at the side
of Caesar himself.

262
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:53,299
I mean it. It can happen
and this is the moment.

263
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:55,180
I swear, this is the time.

264
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,060
The emperor is watching us, judging
us. All I need do is serve him.

265
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,620
And all you need do
is help me serve him.

266
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,140
-You speak as if he were God.
-He is God. The only God.

267
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,260
He is power,
real power on earth, not--

268
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:15,261
Not that.

269
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:18,901
Help me, Judah.

270
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,901
I would do anything
for you, Messala. . .

271
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:27,261
. . .except betray my own people.

272
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:31,862
In the name of all the gods, what do
the lives of a few Jews mean to you?

273
00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:39,262
If I cannot persuade them, that does
not mean I would help you murder them.

274
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:44,702
Besides, you must
understand this, Messala.

275
00:25:44,942 --> 00:25:47,542
I believe in the past
and future of my people.

276
00:25:47,742 --> 00:25:50,302
Future? You are a conquered people.

277
00:25:52,263 --> 00:25:55,783
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.

278
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:58,103
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.

279
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:02,383
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.

280
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,863
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?

281
00:26:05,103 --> 00:26:07,903
Joshua will not rise again
to save you nor David.

282
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:11,824
There is only one reality in
the world today. Look to the West.

283
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,424
Don't be a fool! Look to Rome!

284
00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:15,584
Better a fool
than a traitor or a killer.

285
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:18,464
-I am a soldier.
-Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.

286
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:21,504
-I warn you--
-No! I warn you.

287
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:23,384
Rome is an affront to God.

288
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,824
Rome is strangling my people
and my country, the whole earth!

289
00:26:27,064 --> 00:26:28,425
But not forever.

290
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:32,225
And I tell you, the day Rome falls
there will be a shout of freedom. . .

291
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:35,065
. . .such as the world
has never heard before.

292
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:47,506
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.

293
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:50,706
You're either for me or against me.

294
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,106
If that is the choice. . .

295
00:26:59,346 --> 00:27:01,306
. . .then I am against you.

296
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:29,228
There they are.

297
00:27:30,828 --> 00:27:32,268
Where's Messala?

298
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:35,708
-Where's--?
-He's gone.

299
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,588
Gone?

300
00:27:38,788 --> 00:27:40,548
-But why?
-He couldn't stay.

301
00:27:40,748 --> 00:27:44,029
-What happened?
-A new tribune must have many duties.

302
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:46,949
Come. Let us have dinner.

303
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:03,430
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God,
King of the world. . .

304
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,910
. . .who bringeth to us
bread from the earth.

305
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,590
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.

306
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,071
He wanted to use me
to betray our people.

307
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:11,833
-Master, the caravan from Antioch.
-Yes, Amrah, I saw.

308
00:29:12,873 --> 00:29:14,433
Simonides.

309
00:29:18,194 --> 00:29:20,634
-Oh, welcome homecoming.
-Master.

310
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:23,274
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.

311
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:26,234
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.

312
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:28,234
And for the master, lberian wine.

313
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,234
Not to mention the best gift of all,
your presence.

314
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:35,035
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.

315
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,715
-Caravans from Petra.
-Have all arrived.

316
00:29:37,955 --> 00:29:39,675
-Good.
-Here is the accounting.

317
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,195
And what of Numidia?

318
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:44,835
The trade route is ours,
guaranteed by treaty with the king.

319
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:47,515
Once a year,
you bring your accounting.

320
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:50,475
And once a year,
I find myself wealthier.

321
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,396
Yeah, but my greatest treasure
is my steward.

322
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:56,116
My life belongs to the House of Hur.

323
00:29:56,356 --> 00:29:59,596
Nothing else exists for me,
except my daughter.

324
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:03,356
-She must be a young woman by now.
-Yes, and your property.

325
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:05,516
She was born
the daughter of your slave.

326
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:09,156
When I inherited you,
I inherited a friend, not a slave.

327
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:12,877
Still, Esther has come with me from
Antioch for your permission to marry.

328
00:30:13,157 --> 00:30:16,677
It's granted. I wish you
the joy of many grandchildren.

329
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:20,157
If it is the Lord's will,
I shall rejoice.

330
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:56,159
With your permission,
Esther wishes to speak to her master.

331
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,600
You're eager to marry, Esther?

332
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,680
It is my father's wish.

333
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,680
Your husband will be fortunate.

334
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:27,761
What is his name?

335
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:30,601
David, son of Mathias.

336
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,361
Of what house?

337
00:31:33,081 --> 00:31:35,641
-His own, master.
-He is a freeman.

338
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:38,481
Tell me more about him.

339
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:42,081
I have seen him only once.

340
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:44,321
He is a merchant,
well-thought-of in Antioch.

341
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:46,922
He will pay for Esther's freedom.

342
00:31:47,362 --> 00:31:50,882
Her freedom will be
my wedding gift to Esther.

343
00:31:54,642 --> 00:31:56,762
You are generous, master.

344
00:32:02,602 --> 00:32:04,643
Do you love this man?

345
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:11,043
I will learn to love him.

346
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:30,524
You have my permission to marry.

347
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:33,564
We'll drink to your happiness.

348
00:32:34,564 --> 00:32:36,844
And a safe return to Antioch.

349
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,446
I disturbed you.

350
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:04,126
No.

351
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:06,326
What were you thinking?

352
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:09,486
I was saying goodbye. . .

353
00:33:10,206 --> 00:33:11,726
. . .to this city. . .

354
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:14,246
. . .and this house.

355
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:22,167
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?

356
00:33:23,447 --> 00:33:25,887
My father sometimes brought me here. . .

357
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:27,687
. . .when I was little.

358
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:32,647
It was a house
where I was always happy.

359
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:36,928
Except once.

360
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:41,048
When you and your friend,
the Roman boy--

361
00:33:41,528 --> 00:33:43,248
-Messala.
-Yes.

362
00:33:44,128 --> 00:33:46,048
You had been out hunting. . .

363
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:49,808
. . .and they brought you home injured.

364
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:54,008
I touched your face
as you lay there. . .

365
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:02,129
. . .and prayed to God,
"Don't let this boy die. "

366
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:09,969
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.

367
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:12,929
Yes, master.

368
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:16,450
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.

369
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:22,170
It's strange. I hardly felt a slave.

370
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,730
And now. . .

371
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,970
. . .I hardly feel free.

372
00:34:34,211 --> 00:34:37,811
You know, in the old, wise days
of Solomon. . .

373
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:40,091
. . .if there was among his slaves. . .

374
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:42,971
. . .some girl who filled his eyes. . .

375
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:46,171
. . .he could choose her out
from the rest. . .

376
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:48,771
. . .and take her to him.

377
00:34:49,531 --> 00:34:51,812
Wise days of Solomon.

378
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,852
Different days.

379
00:34:57,772 --> 00:34:59,212
And long ago.

380
00:35:07,852 --> 00:35:10,293
If you were not a bride. . .

381
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:13,453
. . .I should kiss you goodbye.

382
00:35:16,253 --> 00:35:18,093
If I were not a bride. . .

383
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:21,093
. . .there would be no goodbyes
to be said.

384
00:35:33,854 --> 00:35:35,614
Your slave ring.

385
00:35:38,974 --> 00:35:40,614
Fair exchange.

386
00:35:42,254 --> 00:35:45,334
Freedom to you. The ring to me.

387
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:47,335
You will wear it?

388
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:57,175
Until you meet the woman
you will marry?

389
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,656
Until then.

390
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,180
The gods favor my lord Gratus.

391
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,501
If it is the governor's pleasure,
the wreath of office.

392
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:43,341
Thank you, tribune.

393
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:47,701
I see no delegation from the city.

394
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:49,941
-There will not be one, sir.
-No?

395
00:37:50,221 --> 00:37:52,421
Jerusalem's welcome will not
be a warm one.

396
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:55,341
But I pledge, my lord,
it will be a quiet one.

397
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:57,462
Let us proceed.

398
00:38:57,825 --> 00:38:59,305
There's Messala.

399
00:39:10,185 --> 00:39:11,785
He saw you, Judah.

400
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:41,627
The new governor.

401
00:39:56,988 --> 00:39:58,268
Stand back!

402
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:02,548
-Stand back.
-You, come!

403
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:04,628
Had to be the Jews!

404
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:13,429
Open up in the name
of the divine emperor!

405
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:27,070
Judah! Tirzah! What is it?
What's happened?

406
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,110
Open up in the name of the law!

407
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,310
-I was watching the--
-A tile fell and struck the governor.

408
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,550
-It wasn't my fault.
-They won't believe her.

409
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:38,230
She won't have to say anything.
You hear? Tirzah, say nothing.

410
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,470
Open the gates!

411
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:47,871
I'll speak to them.

412
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:50,871
-Arrest him!
-Let me tell you what happened.

413
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:53,231
-Hold those women.
-Stop them!

414
00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:55,471
It was an accident.

415
00:40:57,471 --> 00:41:00,911
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.

416
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:04,512
-This is the man, sir. We saw him.
-It was an accident.

417
00:41:05,712 --> 00:41:06,992
-Accident?
-I swear it.

418
00:41:07,192 --> 00:41:10,352
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose. It gave way.

419
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,312
Take him. Take all of them.

420
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:16,272
-He's telling the truth!
-It was me! Let them go!

421
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:18,232
Attention!

422
00:41:23,473 --> 00:41:24,753
Messala.

423
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:35,433
In the name of God,
tell them it's a mistake.

424
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:38,633
I leaned on the tile,
and it broke loose.

425
00:41:42,074 --> 00:41:44,274
It was an accident.

426
00:41:53,154 --> 00:41:56,274
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!

427
00:42:01,715 --> 00:42:03,115
Let the servants go.

428
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:05,875
Let them go. Return to your ranks.

429
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:32,679
Come.

430
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,040
Where?

431
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,920
Tirus.

432
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,080
Tirus?

433
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,720
I've had no trial.

434
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,120
I'm to die in the galleys
without even a trial?

435
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,920
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!

436
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,281
Wait. My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?

437
00:43:52,481 --> 00:43:53,921
Tie his hands.

438
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:59,801
-At least tell me if they're safe.
-I can tell you nothing.

439
00:44:29,403 --> 00:44:30,883
Get along. Keep moving.

440
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:46,683
Jailer!

441
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:50,204
Guard, in there!

442
00:44:50,684 --> 00:44:52,484
Up the stairs!

443
00:44:52,844 --> 00:44:53,884
Jailer!

444
00:44:55,724 --> 00:44:56,764
Jailer!

445
00:44:58,844 --> 00:45:00,124
To the right.

446
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,367
-Wait!
-Send them out.

447
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:04,568
Go!

448
00:46:09,288 --> 00:46:10,328
The door.

449
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:20,809
Where are my mother and sister?

450
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:33,169
Where are they?

451
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:38,369
Here, within these walls.

452
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,970
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.

453
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:46,090
Of course, they will be sentenced.

454
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:51,330
Is it possible?

455
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:57,210
Is it possible
you could do this to us?

456
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:59,451
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?

457
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:05,611
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!

458
00:47:09,771 --> 00:47:12,771
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!

459
00:47:12,971 --> 00:47:14,571
I know you're not.

460
00:47:15,971 --> 00:47:17,692
You know?

461
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:22,732
You are evil.

462
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:25,572
No, Judah, I am not evil.

463
00:47:26,252 --> 00:47:27,932
I wanted your help.

464
00:47:28,652 --> 00:47:30,492
Now you've given it to me.

465
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:34,412
By making this example of you,
I discourage treason.

466
00:47:34,692 --> 00:47:38,493
By condemning without hesitation
an old friend, I shall be feared.

467
00:47:41,093 --> 00:47:43,093
But not my family.

468
00:47:44,453 --> 00:47:46,093
Let them go.

469
00:47:46,693 --> 00:47:47,653
Please.

470
00:47:50,013 --> 00:47:52,373
-Messala, I beg you.
-Beg?!

471
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:57,414
Didn't I beg you?

472
00:48:02,534 --> 00:48:05,254
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.

473
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:08,254
Kill me, and your mother
and sister will die. . .

474
00:48:08,454 --> 00:48:10,694
. . .nailed to crosses in front of you!

475
00:48:12,615 --> 00:48:14,295
Go on, Judah.

476
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:16,535
Kill me!

477
00:48:28,935 --> 00:48:31,135
May God grant me vengeance.

478
00:48:31,336 --> 00:48:35,016
I will pray that
you live till I return.

479
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:36,976
Return?

480
00:48:42,296 --> 00:48:43,376
Take him.

481
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:18,818
Sentries, salute.

482
00:49:21,898 --> 00:49:23,618
The tribune will see you now.

483
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,260
Tribune, I'm steward
of the House of Hur.

484
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,940
I remember you.

485
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,860
We were on our way to Antioch
when we heard what had happened.

486
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,701
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done
this thing. You knew him, tribune.

487
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:09,421
Better than you.

488
00:50:09,661 --> 00:50:13,941
Then there must be no doubt in
your mind, the charge is groundless.

489
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,301
The prisoners have been sentenced.

490
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:18,661
-Sentenced?
-But there's no truth in it.

491
00:50:18,861 --> 00:50:22,221
There was never a threat against
the governor in Judah's mind.

492
00:50:22,421 --> 00:50:25,102
Surely you must know
he would never have done this.

493
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:27,502
In your heart, you must know it.

494
00:50:32,622 --> 00:50:33,742
Drusus.

495
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:41,703
This man had better be kept here
until we can question him.

496
00:51:35,105 --> 00:51:36,225
Hold!

497
00:52:30,028 --> 00:52:31,708
Water for the soldiers.

498
00:52:32,028 --> 00:52:33,749
Soldiers first!

499
00:52:36,349 --> 00:52:39,029
Get away from that well.
No water for them!

500
00:52:39,509 --> 00:52:41,989
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!

501
00:52:42,229 --> 00:52:44,949
Come on, you! Water for the horses!

502
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:51,549
-Water. Water.
-Soldiers first!

503
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,110
Here.

504
00:53:23,111 --> 00:53:24,191
Wait.

505
00:53:25,151 --> 00:53:26,751
No water for him.

506
00:53:47,832 --> 00:53:49,233
God. . .

507
00:53:49,953 --> 00:53:51,833
. . .help me.

508
00:54:43,515 --> 00:54:46,276
You! I said no water for him!

509
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:21,237
All right, on your feet, all of you!

510
00:55:21,478 --> 00:55:22,798
Get them on their feet!

511
00:55:23,878 --> 00:55:25,918
Back in line, you dog!

512
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:39,798
On your feet!

513
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:41,559
Get them going!

514
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:47,839
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!

515
00:55:50,759 --> 00:55:52,679
Forward, you dogs!

516
00:56:55,243 --> 00:56:57,643
Soon, the counselor's barge
will be coming alongside.

517
00:56:57,843 --> 00:56:59,643
Be ready to raise oars.

518
00:57:05,603 --> 00:57:08,363
Raise oars!

519
00:57:10,723 --> 00:57:12,803
Down oars!

520
00:57:30,484 --> 00:57:32,165
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.

521
00:57:51,766 --> 00:57:54,486
-How many rowers?
-Two hundred, consul.

522
00:57:54,686 --> 00:57:57,406
-And reliefs?
-Of 30, every hour.

523
00:58:30,888 --> 00:58:33,928
This man is ill. Replace him.

524
00:58:34,168 --> 00:58:36,208
-Change him.
-Right, sir.

525
00:58:41,848 --> 00:58:45,408
-This man's been giving you trouble?
-He's insubordinate, consul.

526
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,569
That will stop.

527
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:12,690
What service have you seen?

528
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:15,930
Forty-one.

529
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:19,970
A month's less a day in this ship.

530
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:24,211
You keep an exact account.
And before?

531
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:27,771
Three years in other ships.

532
00:59:29,211 --> 00:59:31,011
Three years.

533
00:59:51,412 --> 00:59:53,772
You have the spirit to fight back. . .

534
00:59:54,372 --> 00:59:56,532
. . .but the good sense to control it.

535
00:59:59,812 --> 01:00:03,453
Your eyes are full of hate, 41 .

536
01:00:03,853 --> 01:00:07,853
That's good. Hate keeps a man alive.

537
01:00:08,173 --> 01:00:09,933
It gives him strength.

538
01:00:11,893 --> 01:00:13,533
Now, listen to me, all of you.

539
01:00:13,853 --> 01:00:18,213
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

540
01:00:22,774 --> 01:00:24,654
So row well. . .

541
01:00:25,494 --> 01:00:27,054
. . .and live.

542
01:00:35,254 --> 01:00:37,854
-Ship ready, consul.
-Strike oars.

543
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:41,575
Strike oars!

544
01:01:01,216 --> 01:01:03,376
You know a fleet
of Macedonian galleys. . .

545
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,256
. . .has been raiding Roman commerce.

546
01:01:06,816 --> 01:01:09,656
The emperor has honored us
with the task. . .

547
01:01:09,856 --> 01:01:12,376
. . .of seeking out and destroying them.

548
01:01:42,898 --> 01:01:44,698
Battle speed, hortator.

549
01:01:46,818 --> 01:01:49,058
Battle speed!

550
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,540
Attack speed.

551
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,740
Attack speed!

552
01:03:00,462 --> 01:03:01,622
Ramming speed.

553
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,342
Ramming speed!

554
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:16,466
Rest.

555
01:04:17,226 --> 01:04:18,746
Halt!

556
01:04:19,786 --> 01:04:21,066
Rest!

557
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:22,790
Why are you here?

558
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:26,310
I was ordered to report to you
during my relief.

559
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:29,990
Oh, yes.

560
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:32,030
I'd forgotten.

561
01:05:38,071 --> 01:05:40,151
You could have killed me
as I lay there.

562
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,431
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?

563
01:05:43,031 --> 01:05:44,951
I'm not ready to die.

564
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:47,191
What do you think will save you?

565
01:05:47,631 --> 01:05:49,911
The God of my fathers.

566
01:05:51,431 --> 01:05:53,311
Your God has forsaken you.

567
01:05:53,511 --> 01:05:56,592
He has no more power
than the images I pray to.

568
01:05:56,792 --> 01:06:00,472
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.

569
01:06:00,672 --> 01:06:02,072
I might.

570
01:06:02,512 --> 01:06:05,352
Does that interest you, 41 ?

571
01:06:07,312 --> 01:06:09,312
I can see that it does.

572
01:06:10,552 --> 01:06:13,592
I'm a fighting man by profession,
and in my leisure moments. . .

573
01:06:13,793 --> 01:06:16,473
. . .it amuses me to train fighting men.

574
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:19,673
I own some of the best gladiators
and charioteers in Rome.

575
01:06:19,873 --> 01:06:21,993
Would you like to become one of them?

576
01:06:22,393 --> 01:06:24,273
To die as your slave?

577
01:06:24,673 --> 01:06:26,913
Better than to live in chains
below these decks.

578
01:06:27,513 --> 01:06:29,473
I will not be here forever.

579
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:31,793
No?

580
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:38,474
What would you do if you escaped?

581
01:06:39,874 --> 01:06:43,514
Two people were condemned with me,
my mother and sister. . .

582
01:06:43,714 --> 01:06:45,874
. . .though they were innocent.
I won't rest--

583
01:06:46,074 --> 01:06:47,834
Do not say that you were innocent.

584
01:06:48,034 --> 01:06:51,195
-Would it do any good to say it again?
-No.

585
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:56,315
Consider my offer carefully. You will
never escape while we are victorious.

586
01:06:56,515 --> 01:07:00,555
If we are not, you will sink
with this ship, chained to your oar.

587
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:03,595
I cannot believe that
God has let me live these years. . .

588
01:07:03,795 --> 01:07:05,475
. . .to die chained to an oar.

589
01:07:05,675 --> 01:07:09,155
It's a strange, stubborn faith
you keep. . .

590
01:07:09,355 --> 01:07:12,116
. . .to believe that
existence has a purpose.

591
01:07:12,316 --> 01:07:16,356
A sane man would have learned
to lose it long before this.

592
01:07:16,556 --> 01:07:17,996
As you have.

593
01:07:18,796 --> 01:07:20,716
What drove it out of you?

594
01:07:22,156 --> 01:07:24,676
Go back to your oar, 41 .

595
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,517
Consul, enemy sighted.

596
01:07:43,557 --> 01:07:45,917
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.

597
01:07:52,518 --> 01:07:55,198
All the watch to battle posts.

598
01:07:59,918 --> 01:08:01,998
-Stand by to load.
-Make ready to fire.

599
01:08:02,198 --> 01:08:03,558
Hurry, quick!

600
01:08:05,959 --> 01:08:08,639
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.

601
01:08:13,999 --> 01:08:16,039
Raise oars!

602
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:19,479
Down oars!

603
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:20,759
Chain rowers!

604
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,001
Guard.

605
01:08:46,561 --> 01:08:48,001
Unlock 41 .

606
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:50,561
No! I don't want to die!

607
01:08:50,761 --> 01:08:52,481
I don't want to die!

608
01:09:21,723 --> 01:09:24,763
41 , why did he do that?

609
01:09:25,523 --> 01:09:26,883
I don't know.

610
01:09:29,523 --> 01:09:32,403
Once before, a man helped me.

611
01:09:33,283 --> 01:09:35,283
I didn't know why then.

612
01:09:36,643 --> 01:09:39,804
Normal speed!

613
01:10:14,485 --> 01:10:16,606
Number 1 , flame.

614
01:10:17,686 --> 01:10:18,646
Fire.

615
01:10:30,846 --> 01:10:31,846
Fire!

616
01:10:32,526 --> 01:10:33,486
Fire!

617
01:10:38,967 --> 01:10:40,847
Hold withdrawal on command.

618
01:10:42,287 --> 01:10:44,967
Lift oars! Raise!

619
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:47,087
Withdraw!

620
01:10:49,567 --> 01:10:50,607
Steersman, right.

621
01:10:58,088 --> 01:10:59,728
Extend oars!

622
01:11:01,368 --> 01:11:02,528
Fire!

623
01:11:23,169 --> 01:11:24,649
-Watch out!
-Fire!

624
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:43,490
Steersman, ram course! Order below!

625
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:45,850
-Ramming speed!
-Ramming speed!

626
01:11:56,811 --> 01:11:59,251
Consul, barge on ramming course.

627
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:10,012
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!

628
01:16:53,027 --> 01:16:54,387
Why did you save me?

629
01:16:57,067 --> 01:16:59,507
Why did you have me unchained?

630
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:21,788
What is your name, 41 ?

631
01:17:23,948 --> 01:17:25,469
Judah Ben-Hur.

632
01:17:26,429 --> 01:17:28,269
Judah Ben-Hur. . .

633
01:17:29,829 --> 01:17:31,109
. . .Iet me die.

634
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:37,389
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

635
01:17:37,789 --> 01:17:39,269
Row well and live.

636
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:55,830
Is the sail square?

637
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:59,590
I can't tell.

638
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:03,431
Better for us both if it's the enemy.

639
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:05,831
My death.

640
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:08,031
Your freedom.

641
01:18:12,511 --> 01:18:14,551
It's a Roman sail.

642
01:18:43,113 --> 01:18:44,513
Face rear!

643
01:18:44,713 --> 01:18:48,593
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.

644
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:52,953
Water.

645
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:59,114
The fleet, all lost?

646
01:18:59,354 --> 01:19:00,914
Five galleys.

647
01:19:01,514 --> 01:19:04,714
-And the battle?
-The battle was won.

648
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,394
You have a victory.

649
01:19:07,354 --> 01:19:09,874
-It was a victory?
-Complete.

650
01:19:27,795 --> 01:19:29,955
In His eagerness to save you. . .

651
01:19:30,195 --> 01:19:33,675
. . .your God has also saved
the Roman fleet.

652
01:20:06,757 --> 01:20:09,277
Hail Arrius!

653
01:20:11,717 --> 01:20:13,758
Right oars!

654
01:23:00,086 --> 01:23:04,447
You have cleared the seaways
of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.

655
01:23:05,287 --> 01:23:08,607
This baton of victory
has been nobly won.

656
01:23:16,127 --> 01:23:19,008
This man riding beside you, who is he?

657
01:23:19,408 --> 01:23:22,368
The man who saved me, divine emperor,
to return and serve you.

658
01:23:22,568 --> 01:23:24,528
Is that all you know about him?

659
01:23:26,888 --> 01:23:31,488
No. He was accused of an attack
on the governor of Judea.

660
01:23:31,688 --> 01:23:33,488
But he was innocent.

661
01:23:33,688 --> 01:23:36,368
If not, there's a strange
inconsistency in this man. . .

662
01:23:36,568 --> 01:23:40,809
. . .who tries to kill my governor,
yet saves the life of my consul.

663
01:23:41,729 --> 01:23:44,569
Come tomorrow. We'll talk of it.

664
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:15,851
We have all the information
on this man. . .

665
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,411
. . .a man of some influence
in his own country.

666
01:24:18,771 --> 01:24:22,771
His attack upon our governor is one
upon the senate and the people of Rome.

667
01:24:22,971 --> 01:24:25,731
I am convinced that
no such attack was intended.

668
01:24:26,131 --> 01:24:29,411
Consul, allow us to continue.

669
01:24:30,531 --> 01:24:32,851
Allow us to be generous.

670
01:24:34,012 --> 01:24:37,132
As a reward to you
for your great victory. . .

671
01:24:37,452 --> 01:24:41,012
. . .we shall not send him back to
the galleys. Take him as your slave.

672
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:47,572
Such is the will of the senate. . .

673
01:24:48,372 --> 01:24:50,252
. . .and the people of Rome.

674
01:26:07,577 --> 01:26:09,737
Not long ago, I returned to Rome. . .

675
01:26:09,937 --> 01:26:12,617
. . .with a young man
who had saved my life.

676
01:26:12,817 --> 01:26:15,897
You all know him as
the finest charioteer in Rome.

677
01:26:16,097 --> 01:26:19,457
Five times, he's driven
my horses to victory.

678
01:26:25,538 --> 01:26:30,018
I know him as one who stands
in the place of the son I lost.

679
01:26:31,018 --> 01:26:33,578
I have the love and pride
in a son's achievements. . .

680
01:26:34,018 --> 01:26:36,098
. . .which I thought
I should never have again.

681
01:26:41,338 --> 01:26:43,378
Nothing could make stronger
our bond. . .

682
01:26:43,578 --> 01:26:46,019
. . .but tonight I wish
to share it with you all.

683
01:26:47,139 --> 01:26:50,939
The formalities of adoption
have been completed.

684
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:54,179
Young Arrius is now
the legal bearer of my name. . .

685
01:26:54,379 --> 01:26:56,499
. . .and the heir to my property.

686
01:27:00,939 --> 01:27:03,260
This ring of my ancestors. . .

687
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:05,780
. . .would have gone to my son.

688
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,660
So now it is yours.

689
01:27:29,821 --> 01:27:34,381
It's a strange destiny that
brought me to a new life. . .

690
01:27:35,141 --> 01:27:36,661
. . .a new home. . .

691
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:39,021
. . .a new father.

692
01:27:40,462 --> 01:27:42,502
It brought me here.

693
01:27:43,142 --> 01:27:45,062
It may take me away.

694
01:27:45,822 --> 01:27:47,542
But wherever I may be. . .

695
01:27:47,782 --> 01:27:51,782
. . .I shall always try to wear this ring
as a son of Arrius should.

696
01:27:52,302 --> 01:27:55,302
With gratitude and affection. . .

697
01:27:56,502 --> 01:27:57,782
. . .and with honor.

698
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:19,024
My old friend Pontius Pilate,
young Arrius.

699
01:28:19,264 --> 01:28:22,304
Before you came to this city,
my horses always won.

700
01:28:22,504 --> 01:28:24,424
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.

701
01:28:24,624 --> 01:28:26,824
Yes, but not swift enough
to defeat you.

702
01:28:27,024 --> 01:28:29,384
-Tell me, you come from Judea?
-Yes, sir.

703
01:28:29,584 --> 01:28:32,264
I hear that the climate
is difficult to live in.

704
01:28:32,464 --> 01:28:34,304
Not for Judeans.

705
01:28:37,785 --> 01:28:40,985
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.

706
01:28:41,225 --> 01:28:42,905
-Of Judea?
-Yes.

707
01:28:43,105 --> 01:28:44,505
I asked for Alexandria.

708
01:28:44,705 --> 01:28:47,465
But it seems the wilderness
needs my particular talents.

709
01:28:47,665 --> 01:28:50,625
The scorpions and holy prophets
can't get on without me.

710
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:54,145
Lay the dust of Judea,
at least for this evening.

711
01:28:54,386 --> 01:28:56,706
Goats and Jehovah.

712
01:29:14,467 --> 01:29:15,787
You're leaving.

713
01:29:18,827 --> 01:29:20,267
I must.

714
01:29:21,587 --> 01:29:23,947
It's a journey I can't keep you from.

715
01:29:25,427 --> 01:29:29,707
Your eyes have never left it all
these months. I can recognize pain.

716
01:29:29,907 --> 01:29:33,508
But still, my counsel is to wait.

717
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:36,068
Gratus is to be replaced.

718
01:29:36,308 --> 01:29:39,348
The governorship goes
to Pontius Pilate.

719
01:29:43,028 --> 01:29:44,108
When?

720
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:45,988
Very soon.

721
01:29:46,548 --> 01:29:48,748
It's very much to our purpose.

722
01:29:49,868 --> 01:29:54,269
Nothing is to the purpose if, when
I come back to Judea, I come too late.

723
01:29:57,309 --> 01:30:01,389
That is the thought which has punished
me every moment I've spent here.

724
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,270
Will Rome see you again?

725
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:20,510
Here is a part of my life
which you have made for me.

726
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:23,790
I shall remember it.

727
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:31,111
Whoever the gods are, they take
small interest in an old man's hopes.

728
01:30:31,991 --> 01:30:33,351
They have their way.

729
01:32:09,996 --> 01:32:11,436
Forgive me.

730
01:32:11,796 --> 01:32:13,916
You're a stranger here.

731
01:32:15,116 --> 01:32:17,436
Would you be from Nazareth?

732
01:32:19,597 --> 01:32:20,957
Why do you ask?

733
01:32:21,437 --> 01:32:22,397
I thought. . .

734
01:32:23,957 --> 01:32:26,157
. . .you might be the one--

735
01:32:28,077 --> 01:32:31,517
The one that I have come back
from my country to find.

736
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:37,677
He would be about your age.

737
01:32:38,798 --> 01:32:39,598
Who?

738
01:32:43,158 --> 01:32:44,918
When I find Him. . .

739
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:47,718
. . .I shall know Him.

740
01:32:52,838 --> 01:32:56,078
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.

741
01:32:56,318 --> 01:32:58,679
I am the guest of Sheik llderim.

742
01:32:59,519 --> 01:33:01,239
Sack of flesh without brains!

743
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:04,079
No! No! Not the whip!

744
01:33:05,599 --> 01:33:06,639
That is my host.

745
01:33:06,839 --> 01:33:07,959
Gently! Gently!

746
01:33:08,559 --> 01:33:11,919
Fool! Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!

747
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:15,360
Whip my children once and
I'll drain every drop of your blood.

748
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:19,520
Now, gently around the first turn,
and let them run! Go on!

749
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,880
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!

750
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:29,880
Beautiful horses.

751
01:33:41,081 --> 01:33:43,441
Now! Now! They are ready!
Let them go!

752
01:33:49,921 --> 01:33:52,281
Watch. They'll never hold the turn.

753
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:56,842
No! No!

754
01:33:58,602 --> 01:34:00,682
Abadon, stop him!

755
01:34:02,602 --> 01:34:03,922
Stop that whip!

756
01:34:04,122 --> 01:34:06,042
I'll kill him! I'll kill--!

757
01:34:11,323 --> 01:34:14,363
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!

758
01:34:17,323 --> 01:34:19,963
You think you can treat
my horses like animals?!

759
01:34:21,403 --> 01:34:24,123
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!

760
01:34:24,363 --> 01:34:25,883
Get off, idiot!

761
01:34:31,004 --> 01:34:32,524
Drive goats, not horses!

762
01:34:32,724 --> 01:34:34,804
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?

763
01:34:35,004 --> 01:34:38,124
This traveler told what would happen
before it happened.

764
01:34:39,964 --> 01:34:42,804
Your horses are very fine,
but they're not a team.

765
01:34:43,004 --> 01:34:44,364
Not a team?

766
01:34:44,564 --> 01:34:47,284
But one of them held steady,
the one on the outside.

767
01:34:47,484 --> 01:34:49,685
-Antares.
-The slow one?

768
01:34:49,885 --> 01:34:54,045
He should run on the inside where
he can steady the others in the turns.

769
01:34:59,565 --> 01:35:02,845
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?

770
01:35:03,045 --> 01:35:04,845
In the circus in Rome.

771
01:35:06,805 --> 01:35:09,286
You have driven in the great circus?

772
01:35:10,926 --> 01:35:15,086
Tell me, my friend, could you
make my four run as one?

773
01:35:15,326 --> 01:35:16,806
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.

774
01:35:17,006 --> 01:35:19,006
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?

775
01:35:19,246 --> 01:35:21,246
We have time enough
to eat, drink and talk.

776
01:35:21,446 --> 01:35:23,526
Come into my tent
and refresh yourself.

777
01:35:23,726 --> 01:35:26,967
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.

778
01:35:28,767 --> 01:35:32,567
If I had a voice to sing,
I would sing you the psalm of horses.

779
01:35:32,767 --> 01:35:35,327
No other animal has
descended so in scale. . .

780
01:35:35,527 --> 01:35:38,007
. . .from the first innocent falling
of the world.

781
01:35:39,007 --> 01:35:42,607
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares
on the inside.

782
01:35:42,807 --> 01:35:46,128
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.

783
01:35:46,608 --> 01:35:48,528
Judah Ben-Hur.

784
01:35:48,728 --> 01:35:51,448
You're a Jew,
yet you drove in the great circus.

785
01:35:51,648 --> 01:35:52,768
Yes.

786
01:35:54,288 --> 01:35:58,128
By a strange choice
and a stranger fortune.

787
01:35:58,928 --> 01:36:01,448
Your coming here was so fit, so right.

788
01:36:01,648 --> 01:36:04,129
We might have achieved wonders!

789
01:36:04,329 --> 01:36:06,089
You have to go.

790
01:36:10,329 --> 01:36:12,289
I make a journey which will not wait.

791
01:36:12,489 --> 01:36:14,729
Ah, well, then perhaps
you will come back.

792
01:36:14,929 --> 01:36:17,249
And when you do,
bring your friends, your wives.

793
01:36:17,449 --> 01:36:19,089
I have no wives.

794
01:36:19,329 --> 01:36:21,169
No wives at all?

795
01:36:21,489 --> 01:36:23,690
I have six, no, seven.

796
01:36:23,890 --> 01:36:25,490
I've counted eight.

797
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:28,850
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.

798
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:32,290
Believe me, it is a great advantage
to have many wives.

799
01:36:32,490 --> 01:36:35,050
-Someday, I hope to have one.
-One wife!

800
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:39,490
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.

801
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:41,691
It is not generous.

802
01:36:46,731 --> 01:36:50,331
-Was the food not to your liking?
-Indeed.

803
01:37:01,812 --> 01:37:03,652
Thank you. Thank you.

804
01:37:03,852 --> 01:37:08,332
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.

805
01:37:09,492 --> 01:37:12,932
And now I must say good night
to my beauties.

806
01:37:13,572 --> 01:37:16,252
When ready for sleep,
they get impatient and jealous.

807
01:37:16,452 --> 01:37:19,173
They wait to see which one
I will embrace first.

808
01:37:19,693 --> 01:37:21,933
-I'll make my farewells then.
-No, no, no, stay.

809
01:37:22,133 --> 01:37:24,013
Stay and see them.

810
01:37:37,334 --> 01:37:40,134
Come, my children. Come.

811
01:37:45,974 --> 01:37:47,574
Strangers make them shy.

812
01:37:48,854 --> 01:37:49,734
Come.

813
01:37:50,174 --> 01:37:52,894
Come, do not be afraid. Come.

814
01:37:58,455 --> 01:38:00,415
There, my children.

815
01:38:00,735 --> 01:38:03,455
They are descended from
the Arabians of the Pharaohs. . .

816
01:38:03,655 --> 01:38:05,895
. . .and I have named them
for the stars.

817
01:38:07,535 --> 01:38:09,055
Come, Antares.

818
01:38:09,295 --> 01:38:12,695
You are the slowest, and you can
run all day without tiring.

819
01:38:12,895 --> 01:38:15,336
What? Yes, yes.

820
01:38:15,536 --> 01:38:19,176
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.

821
01:38:19,416 --> 01:38:20,576
Come, Rigel.

822
01:38:20,776 --> 01:38:24,336
We've both supped well,
and the world is good.

823
01:38:24,696 --> 01:38:25,856
There's my good Rigel.

824
01:38:28,016 --> 01:38:30,256
Yes, you are ready for sleep.

825
01:38:31,496 --> 01:38:33,897
The day's work done for you, eh?

826
01:38:35,137 --> 01:38:37,417
Yes, well, you can go
to sleep in a minute.

827
01:38:37,657 --> 01:38:39,977
Good night. Good night, my treasure.

828
01:38:42,017 --> 01:38:45,097
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.

829
01:38:45,337 --> 01:38:48,857
No. You are the swiftest,
but you must be steady.

830
01:38:51,298 --> 01:38:53,578
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.

831
01:38:53,778 --> 01:38:55,698
You should see their mother, Mira.

832
01:38:55,898 --> 01:38:58,818
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.

833
01:38:59,018 --> 01:39:00,898
All right, all right.

834
01:39:05,098 --> 01:39:08,738
You are their friend, and they do
not give their affections readily.

835
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:12,899
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.

836
01:39:13,659 --> 01:39:17,739
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.

837
01:39:18,459 --> 01:39:20,859
You must be strong and swift.

838
01:39:21,059 --> 01:39:23,419
Go, my children. Go.

839
01:39:27,619 --> 01:39:30,580
At Jerusalem, they'll race
the world's finest teams. . .

840
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:34,380
. . .and the champion of the East,
Messala, with his black devils.

841
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:36,180
He stops at nothing to win.

842
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:39,140
-Messala? ln the circus?
-Yes.

843
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:40,940
You knew him?

844
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:43,140
I know him.

845
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,620
Perhaps without much liking.

846
01:39:49,021 --> 01:39:50,741
My people are praying for a man. . .

847
01:39:50,941 --> 01:39:53,381
. . .to drive their team
to victory over Messala.

848
01:39:53,581 --> 01:39:55,621
You could be that man, the one. . .

849
01:39:55,821 --> 01:39:57,861
. . .to stamp his arrogance
into the sand.

850
01:39:58,061 --> 01:40:01,061
My horses need only a driver
who is worthy of them. . .

851
01:40:01,301 --> 01:40:04,781
. . .one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.

852
01:40:04,981 --> 01:40:06,662
It's not possible.

853
01:40:07,902 --> 01:40:09,462
That is a pity.

854
01:40:10,422 --> 01:40:12,382
Think of it. To break his pride. . .

855
01:40:12,582 --> 01:40:15,942
. . .to humble this tribune before
the very people he has degraded.

856
01:40:16,142 --> 01:40:20,502
Just think, his defeat and humiliation
at the hands of a Jew!

857
01:40:21,102 --> 01:40:23,182
I know it is not possible.

858
01:40:23,542 --> 01:40:26,183
Does it not delight your imagination?

859
01:40:27,583 --> 01:40:29,823
Does it not answer your purpose?

860
01:40:30,823 --> 01:40:32,943
I must deal with Messala
in my own way.

861
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:35,663
And your way is to kill him.

862
01:40:39,303 --> 01:40:42,063
I see this terrible thing
in your eyes.

863
01:40:42,423 --> 01:40:46,464
But no matter what this man has done,
you have no right to kill him.

864
01:40:46,864 --> 01:40:49,144
He will be punished inevitably.

865
01:40:50,184 --> 01:40:51,744
I don't believe in miracles.

866
01:40:52,744 --> 01:40:54,584
But all life is a miracle.

867
01:40:54,784 --> 01:40:57,024
Why will you not
accept God's judgment?

868
01:40:59,784 --> 01:41:01,625
You do not believe in miracles.

869
01:41:02,465 --> 01:41:05,385
Yet God once spoke to me
out of the darkness. . .

870
01:41:05,585 --> 01:41:08,145
. . .and a star led me
to a village called Bethlehem. . .

871
01:41:08,345 --> 01:41:11,305
. . .where I found a newborn child
in a manger.

872
01:41:11,505 --> 01:41:13,305
And God lived in this child.

873
01:41:14,385 --> 01:41:18,105
By now, He is a grown man
and must be ready to begin his work.

874
01:41:18,345 --> 01:41:19,945
That is why I have returned here. . .

875
01:41:20,146 --> 01:41:22,826
. . .so that I may be at hand
when He comes among us.

876
01:41:24,946 --> 01:41:26,466
He is near.

877
01:41:27,426 --> 01:41:30,906
He saw the sun set this evening,
as we did.

878
01:41:31,426 --> 01:41:35,186
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway
somewhere or on a hilltop.

879
01:41:35,826 --> 01:41:37,906
Perhaps He is a shepherd. . .

880
01:41:38,106 --> 01:41:40,867
. . .a merchant, a fisherman.

881
01:41:41,347 --> 01:41:42,987
But He lives. . .

882
01:41:43,187 --> 01:41:47,347
. . .and all our lives from now on
will carry His mark.

883
01:41:49,427 --> 01:41:52,067
There are many paths to God, my son.

884
01:41:53,147 --> 01:41:55,307
I hope yours will not
be too difficult.

885
01:42:05,708 --> 01:42:07,468
I'm ready for sleep.

886
01:42:21,309 --> 01:42:23,629
Balthasar is a good man. . .

887
01:42:23,829 --> 01:42:27,909
. . .but until all men are like him,
we must keep our swords bright.

888
01:42:28,189 --> 01:42:30,189
And our intention true.

889
01:42:31,309 --> 01:42:32,989
So I must leave you.

890
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:36,910
One last thought.

891
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:39,710
There is no law in the arena.

892
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:42,310
Many are killed.

893
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,230
I hope to see you again.

894
01:43:01,551 --> 01:43:03,831
Fine Damascus silk.

895
01:43:04,111 --> 01:43:06,351
Fine Damascus silk.

896
01:45:08,278 --> 01:45:09,598
Esther?

897
01:45:20,678 --> 01:45:22,359
It's Judah.

898
01:45:30,279 --> 01:45:32,119
You are alive.

899
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:35,279
You are alive.

900
01:45:36,959 --> 01:45:40,759
What are you doing here?
What has happened?

901
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:51,080
I'm here.

902
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,080
I'm with you.

903
01:46:00,321 --> 01:46:01,921
Where's your father?

904
01:46:06,721 --> 01:46:10,401
The day they took you away,
they imprisoned him.

905
01:46:10,841 --> 01:46:12,561
They tortured him.

906
01:46:13,001 --> 01:46:17,361
When they were sure he was hiding
nothing, they let him go.

907
01:46:18,762 --> 01:46:23,322
Ever since then, we have been
living here, in hiding.

908
01:46:23,922 --> 01:46:26,042
You never went back to Antioch?

909
01:46:26,402 --> 01:46:27,522
No.

910
01:46:27,762 --> 01:46:32,002
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.

911
01:46:38,283 --> 01:46:40,163
Where are my mother and sister?

912
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:51,363
Let me tell him first.

913
01:47:09,124 --> 01:47:10,284
Father.

914
01:47:11,484 --> 01:47:14,084
Father, something wonderful
has happened.

915
01:47:15,365 --> 01:47:17,365
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.

916
01:47:18,725 --> 01:47:21,925
He has come home. He is here.

917
01:47:38,886 --> 01:47:40,166
Judah.

918
01:47:41,926 --> 01:47:44,166
Judah Ben-Hur.

919
01:47:46,726 --> 01:47:48,806
My dear old friend.

920
01:47:50,726 --> 01:47:52,607
Let me look at you.

921
01:47:53,127 --> 01:47:54,607
Let me see you.

922
01:47:55,967 --> 01:47:58,807
Yes, yes. It is true.

923
01:47:59,527 --> 01:48:02,967
Praise God for His mercy.

924
01:48:23,648 --> 01:48:24,968
Where are they?

925
01:48:26,128 --> 01:48:29,209
Since that terrible day. . .

926
01:48:30,089 --> 01:48:32,529
. . .there has been no word of them.

927
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:49,650
You should have been less loyal.

928
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:51,770
Do not pity me, Master Judah.

929
01:48:51,970 --> 01:48:54,890
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.

930
01:48:56,370 --> 01:49:00,330
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.

931
01:49:00,530 --> 01:49:02,530
We were released on the same day.

932
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:07,371
Malluch without a tongue,
and I without life in my legs.

933
01:49:07,571 --> 01:49:09,891
Since then, I have been his tongue. . .

934
01:49:10,091 --> 01:49:11,691
. . .and he has been my legs.

935
01:49:11,891 --> 01:49:14,971
Together, we make a considerable man.

936
01:49:16,811 --> 01:49:18,371
Old friend.

937
01:49:19,771 --> 01:49:22,451
She always said you would return.

938
01:49:22,651 --> 01:49:24,892
She never gave up hope.

939
01:49:26,892 --> 01:49:29,372
Though I hoped it,
I didn't believe it.

940
01:49:30,612 --> 01:49:34,292
I see that your one thought is
to save your mother and sister.

941
01:49:35,572 --> 01:49:37,772
But suppose that isn't possible.

942
01:49:37,972 --> 01:49:40,452
If one purpose fails,
it is good to have another.

943
01:49:41,332 --> 01:49:43,373
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.

944
01:49:43,573 --> 01:49:46,373
They could not make me
tell them where it is.

945
01:49:46,573 --> 01:49:47,653
It is there still. . .

946
01:49:47,853 --> 01:49:51,133
. . .to put power into our hands
and buy death for the Romans.

947
01:49:54,293 --> 01:49:56,533
That's not why I came back.

948
01:49:56,773 --> 01:49:59,573
Judah, they are dead.

949
01:49:59,973 --> 01:50:04,454
Four years. No one could live
so long in the dungeons.

950
01:50:09,014 --> 01:50:11,814
Who lives more than one year
in the galleys?

951
01:50:12,494 --> 01:50:14,614
Yes, it is true.

952
01:50:16,854 --> 01:50:19,574
Judah Ben-Hur.

953
01:50:22,055 --> 01:50:25,735
You have come back to us
like a returning faith.

954
01:50:25,935 --> 01:50:28,935
Judah, I should like to laugh again.

955
01:50:29,135 --> 01:50:30,415
-Let us laugh.
-We will.

956
01:50:30,615 --> 01:50:32,415
There will be joy again
in this house.

957
01:50:32,615 --> 01:50:35,455
We will celebrate among the dust.

958
01:50:47,896 --> 01:50:49,296
I will take him.

959
01:51:19,578 --> 01:51:21,458
We stood here before.

960
01:51:24,578 --> 01:51:26,538
A long while ago.

961
01:51:27,618 --> 01:51:28,978
Four years.

962
01:51:32,698 --> 01:51:34,418
But now it seems as if. . .

963
01:51:35,018 --> 01:51:36,859
. . .only yesterday. . . .

964
01:51:38,699 --> 01:51:40,139
I was saying:

965
01:51:42,299 --> 01:51:45,899
"If you were not a bride,
I should kiss you goodbye. "

966
01:51:47,859 --> 01:51:49,899
"If I were not a bride. . .

967
01:51:50,099 --> 01:51:52,779
. . .there would be
no goodbyes to be said. "

968
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:04,820
I am not a bride.

969
01:52:35,462 --> 01:52:37,622
Why did you never marry?

970
01:52:39,702 --> 01:52:41,422
My father needed me.

971
01:52:45,982 --> 01:52:47,302
And also. . . .

972
01:52:55,863 --> 01:52:57,783
It's still on my finger.

973
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:04,583
I said I should wear it
till I met a woman I would marry.

974
01:53:11,224 --> 01:53:13,784
It's become a part of my hand.

975
01:53:22,224 --> 01:53:25,144
If Messala once knew you were here. . . .

976
01:53:25,584 --> 01:53:26,945
As he must.

977
01:53:27,505 --> 01:53:29,385
He will know where they are.

978
01:53:37,105 --> 01:53:38,785
And if you should find. . .?

979
01:53:41,425 --> 01:53:44,985
-If he says they're dead--
-Messala will wish they were living.

980
01:53:50,306 --> 01:53:53,426
I've seen too much
of what hate can do.

981
01:53:53,986 --> 01:53:56,106
My father is burned up with it.

982
01:53:58,106 --> 01:54:02,546
But I've heard of a young rabbi who
says that forgiveness is greater. . .

983
01:54:02,746 --> 01:54:05,467
. . .and love more powerful than hatred.

984
01:54:06,547 --> 01:54:07,987
I believe it.

985
01:54:08,587 --> 01:54:10,427
-Esther.
-Judah.

986
01:54:10,947 --> 01:54:12,547
Stay alive.

987
01:54:13,107 --> 01:54:14,987
Keep away from Messala.

988
01:54:15,227 --> 01:54:17,947
Only if I can give up
thinking and feeling.

989
01:54:19,987 --> 01:54:21,907
That time isn't yet come.

990
01:54:22,107 --> 01:54:26,428
The stone that fell from this roof
so long ago is still falling.

991
01:54:26,908 --> 01:54:29,508
Only this time you won't be sent
to the galleys.

992
01:54:29,708 --> 01:54:31,828
This time you will be destroyed.

993
01:54:32,028 --> 01:54:33,508
You'll die.

994
01:55:15,550 --> 01:55:18,951
Tribune, compliments of Quintus
Arrius. He awaits your pleasure.

995
01:55:19,151 --> 01:55:21,711
-Consul here?
-Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.

996
01:55:21,911 --> 01:55:23,911
Thank him. Bring him to me.

997
01:55:24,711 --> 01:55:29,791
-I didn't know the consul had a son.
-He's a champion of the great circus.

998
01:55:30,111 --> 01:55:31,471
Why is he presenting me with gifts?

999
01:55:33,551 --> 01:55:35,831
-Perhaps he'll race against you.
-Look.

1000
01:55:37,672 --> 01:55:39,312
It's magnificent.

1001
01:55:39,512 --> 01:55:41,352
And from a man I've never met.

1002
01:55:41,552 --> 01:55:43,512
You're wrong, Messala.

1003
01:56:07,073 --> 01:56:09,953
By what magic do you bear
the name of a consul of Rome?

1004
01:56:11,233 --> 01:56:13,433
You were the magician, Messala.

1005
01:56:13,633 --> 01:56:15,834
You condemned me to the galleys.

1006
01:56:16,554 --> 01:56:19,234
When my ship was sunk,
I saved the consul's life.

1007
01:56:30,954 --> 01:56:32,514
You know his seal?

1008
01:56:44,035 --> 01:56:45,875
Now I have come back. . .

1009
01:56:46,155 --> 01:56:48,435
. . .as I swore I would.

1010
01:56:53,716 --> 01:56:57,756
Your gift is exquisitely
appropriate, young Arrius.

1011
01:56:58,756 --> 01:57:01,356
You suggest I use it on myself?

1012
01:57:02,796 --> 01:57:06,516
What has become of
my mother and my sister?

1013
01:57:10,116 --> 01:57:13,037
It is not my duty
to keep track of prisoners.

1014
01:57:13,677 --> 01:57:14,957
Find them, Messala.

1015
01:57:16,397 --> 01:57:18,837
Restore them to me,
and I'll forget what I vowed. . .

1016
01:57:19,037 --> 01:57:22,437
. . .with every stroke of that oar
you chained me to.

1017
01:57:25,877 --> 01:57:28,837
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.

1018
01:57:29,037 --> 01:57:29,998
Then get it.

1019
01:57:34,758 --> 01:57:36,878
I will come back tomorrow.

1020
01:57:37,758 --> 01:57:40,438
Don't disappoint me, Messala.

1021
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:56,319
What became of them?

1022
01:57:56,599 --> 01:57:59,999
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?

1023
01:58:00,199 --> 01:58:02,719
Go to the citadel, Drusus. Find out.

1024
01:58:02,919 --> 01:58:05,039
-And if they're dead?
-They're dead!

1025
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:22,360
"Miriam, wife. Tirzah, daughter. "

1026
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:25,000
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?

1027
01:58:25,441 --> 01:58:26,761
E section. . .

1028
01:58:28,001 --> 01:58:29,441
. . .Iower level.

1029
01:58:30,521 --> 01:58:33,641
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.

1030
01:58:50,602 --> 01:58:51,722
Water.

1031
01:58:52,242 --> 01:58:53,322
Water.

1032
01:58:53,922 --> 01:58:55,162
Let me out!

1033
01:59:29,324 --> 01:59:32,084
-How long since you've seen them?
-Never.

1034
01:59:32,324 --> 01:59:36,204
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.

1035
01:59:39,324 --> 01:59:40,965
The food disappears.

1036
02:00:14,006 --> 02:00:15,326
Lepers.

1037
02:00:43,408 --> 02:00:46,168
They must be taken outside the city
and released at once.

1038
02:00:46,408 --> 02:00:47,968
Then we'll burn out the cell.

1039
02:01:32,851 --> 02:01:34,331
Is someone there?

1040
02:01:39,731 --> 02:01:41,771
There is someone there.

1041
02:01:54,572 --> 02:01:55,772
Who are you?

1042
02:01:58,772 --> 02:02:00,492
Don't come any closer.

1043
02:02:03,652 --> 02:02:04,612
Who are you?

1044
02:02:07,892 --> 02:02:08,853
Esther.

1045
02:02:10,773 --> 02:02:12,053
It's Miriam.

1046
02:02:12,573 --> 02:02:13,653
Miriam.

1047
02:02:15,893 --> 02:02:17,133
Miriam?

1048
02:02:19,693 --> 02:02:21,773
Stay where you are.

1049
02:02:23,893 --> 02:02:25,693
You have come home.

1050
02:02:27,373 --> 02:02:29,374
Stand back, Esther.

1051
02:02:37,694 --> 02:02:39,094
We are lepers.

1052
02:02:52,135 --> 02:02:53,695
Oh, Esther.

1053
02:02:55,535 --> 02:02:56,775
Tirzah.

1054
02:03:05,176 --> 02:03:06,576
Esther. . .

1055
02:03:08,256 --> 02:03:10,496
. . .is Judah living?

1056
02:03:11,256 --> 02:03:13,976
Yes, he is alive.

1057
02:03:14,736 --> 02:03:16,376
He is here.

1058
02:03:19,096 --> 02:03:20,056
Where?

1059
02:03:21,936 --> 02:03:25,217
He is searching for you now.

1060
02:03:25,537 --> 02:03:28,337
I must find him and tell him.

1061
02:03:28,537 --> 02:03:29,697
-No!
-Tell my father.

1062
02:03:29,897 --> 02:03:31,017
No.

1063
02:03:31,937 --> 02:03:33,577
Tell no one.

1064
02:03:36,177 --> 02:03:39,497
We are going away
to the Valley of the Lepers.

1065
02:03:39,897 --> 02:03:41,377
We won't return.

1066
02:03:44,458 --> 02:03:46,498
Judah has to be told.

1067
02:03:46,938 --> 02:03:47,898
No.

1068
02:03:50,818 --> 02:03:51,898
Please.

1069
02:04:10,419 --> 02:04:12,779
I couldn't see his face.

1070
02:04:14,499 --> 02:04:16,059
Is it changed?

1071
02:04:18,859 --> 02:04:21,820
No, he is not changed.

1072
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:28,980
He's not changed.

1073
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:33,220
You love him, Esther.

1074
02:04:43,901 --> 02:04:45,541
Promise me. . .

1075
02:04:46,141 --> 02:04:48,141
. . .on your love for him. . .

1076
02:04:49,341 --> 02:04:51,901
. . .you will never tell him
you've seen us.

1077
02:05:00,622 --> 02:05:02,502
Is he never to know?

1078
02:05:06,342 --> 02:05:08,822
Let him remember us as we were.

1079
02:05:10,342 --> 02:05:11,502
Promise me.

1080
02:05:21,743 --> 02:05:24,903
There's nothing else I can hope for.

1081
02:05:25,903 --> 02:05:27,503
Only this.

1082
02:05:34,344 --> 02:05:35,984
I promise.

1083
02:05:39,904 --> 02:05:41,584
I am content.

1084
02:06:00,185 --> 02:06:01,345
Wait.

1085
02:06:45,547 --> 02:06:47,587
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.

1086
02:06:47,787 --> 02:06:51,708
I pray to God they're alive
and that Messala will free them.

1087
02:06:51,908 --> 02:06:53,708
He'll free them.

1088
02:06:53,908 --> 02:06:55,948
He wants to survive.

1089
02:06:57,388 --> 02:06:59,108
He cannot free them, Judah.

1090
02:07:02,828 --> 02:07:03,788
What do you mean?

1091
02:07:12,549 --> 02:07:13,549
I saw them.

1092
02:07:13,949 --> 02:07:15,549
You saw them?

1093
02:07:15,749 --> 02:07:16,869
Where?

1094
02:07:17,069 --> 02:07:18,669
When did you see them?

1095
02:07:24,069 --> 02:07:25,469
They were dead.

1096
02:07:27,950 --> 02:07:29,550
They were dead.

1097
02:07:31,590 --> 02:07:32,550
When?

1098
02:07:34,150 --> 02:07:36,430
When? When?!

1099
02:07:38,670 --> 02:07:40,030
In the prison.

1100
02:07:42,150 --> 02:07:44,911
When I was waiting
for news of my father.

1101
02:07:49,351 --> 02:07:51,071
Why didn't you tell me?

1102
02:07:56,551 --> 02:07:57,911
I couldn't tell you.

1103
02:07:59,111 --> 02:08:00,791
Nor even you, Father.

1104
02:08:02,391 --> 02:08:04,712
I was afraid that
if you saw Messala. . . .

1105
02:08:05,472 --> 02:08:08,592
Judah, you have come
to the end of your search.

1106
02:08:08,792 --> 02:08:10,112
It's over now.

1107
02:08:10,592 --> 02:08:11,752
Over?

1108
02:08:12,632 --> 02:08:14,152
-Judah.
-Over?

1109
02:08:14,392 --> 02:08:18,472
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.

1110
02:09:47,930 --> 02:09:49,090
Gentlemen.

1111
02:09:49,290 --> 02:09:50,090
Officers.

1112
02:09:52,130 --> 02:09:54,770
Defenders of great Rome's imperium. . .

1113
02:09:55,570 --> 02:09:57,171
. . .may I enter?

1114
02:09:57,811 --> 02:09:59,251
Certainly, sheik.

1115
02:09:59,651 --> 02:10:01,571
You do us an unexpected honor.

1116
02:10:02,651 --> 02:10:04,931
The noble tribune is most gracious.

1117
02:10:14,131 --> 02:10:15,051
And now. . .

1118
02:10:15,251 --> 02:10:17,012
. . .the question you're asking:

1119
02:10:17,212 --> 02:10:18,812
Why am I here?

1120
02:10:19,252 --> 02:10:21,132
As you know, I am a gambling man.

1121
02:10:21,332 --> 02:10:22,572
The games approach.

1122
02:10:22,772 --> 02:10:27,652
I am racing my whites against the
noble tribune's undefeated blacks.

1123
02:10:27,852 --> 02:10:29,932
I will back my own poor horses.

1124
02:10:30,132 --> 02:10:31,572
No limits?

1125
02:10:47,973 --> 02:10:49,453
-Mark me first!
-And me!

1126
02:10:49,653 --> 02:10:51,093
-What odds?
-A moment, please. . .

1127
02:10:51,293 --> 02:10:54,214
. . .my lords, protectors
of the far flung marshes.

1128
02:10:54,454 --> 02:10:55,814
May I first sit down?

1129
02:10:56,014 --> 02:10:57,774
Sit. How much will you wager?

1130
02:10:57,974 --> 02:11:00,694
-Yes, let's call his game.
-Give the Arab a seat.

1131
02:11:00,894 --> 02:11:02,734
A bench, quickly.

1132
02:11:03,734 --> 02:11:05,014
Thank you.

1133
02:11:08,254 --> 02:11:10,294
-Now.
-1 000 denarii.

1134
02:11:10,494 --> 02:11:12,895
-2000!
-Mark me!

1135
02:11:13,095 --> 02:11:17,695
Your spirit does you credit, but do
not be impatient. There is time.

1136
02:11:18,095 --> 02:11:21,055
First gentlemen, the odds.

1137
02:11:21,535 --> 02:11:24,895
The tribune has won many times. The
odds should be in the same measure.

1138
02:11:25,935 --> 02:11:28,055
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?

1139
02:11:29,135 --> 02:11:30,376
Two to one.

1140
02:11:32,176 --> 02:11:36,096
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber,
masters of the Earth. . .

1141
02:11:36,296 --> 02:11:39,776
. . .where is the courage
that made Rome master of the world?

1142
02:11:39,976 --> 02:11:42,576
I can get better odds
on any street market.

1143
02:11:43,376 --> 02:11:44,736
Three to one.

1144
02:11:45,216 --> 02:11:47,376
Let us not haggle. Let us be fair.

1145
02:11:47,616 --> 02:11:50,817
In four years, the tribune has won
four victories in the circus.

1146
02:11:51,017 --> 02:11:53,177
-In all truth--
-Just a moment.

1147
02:11:54,217 --> 02:11:57,217
We know you have good horses,
but who is your driver?

1148
02:11:59,697 --> 02:12:03,057
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.

1149
02:12:03,257 --> 02:12:05,177
The Prince of Hur.

1150
02:12:06,817 --> 02:12:09,258
Judah Ben-Hur.

1151
02:12:09,498 --> 02:12:11,058
Prince of Hur?

1152
02:12:11,978 --> 02:12:14,858
-He was sent to the galleys years ago.
-He has returned.

1153
02:12:15,058 --> 02:12:17,178
Returned? lmpossible.

1154
02:12:17,378 --> 02:12:20,738
The divine Tiberius is merciful
as always.

1155
02:12:23,338 --> 02:12:24,298
Well?

1156
02:12:24,578 --> 02:12:28,699
Will no one back the noble tribune
against a Jew, a galley slave?

1157
02:12:32,059 --> 02:12:34,299
Perhaps I made a mistake
in coming here.

1158
02:12:38,059 --> 02:12:39,499
You, tribune. . .

1159
02:12:39,779 --> 02:12:41,699
. . .will you give me four to one?

1160
02:12:45,820 --> 02:12:47,100
Four to one.

1161
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:48,300
Good.

1162
02:12:48,980 --> 02:12:53,620
Four to one, sheik. The difference
between a Roman and a Jew.

1163
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:55,340
Or an Arab.

1164
02:13:00,940 --> 02:13:02,540
Bravely spoken.

1165
02:13:04,541 --> 02:13:08,741
Now we will settle the amount
of our wager. I will venture. . . .

1166
02:13:19,181 --> 02:13:21,021
A thousand talents?

1167
02:13:22,582 --> 02:13:26,502
-A thousand talents?
-Yes, a thousand talents.

1168
02:13:32,062 --> 02:13:33,902
Of course, if it is too much. . . .

1169
02:13:35,342 --> 02:13:37,342
A thousand talents it will be.

1170
02:13:37,742 --> 02:13:38,902
Agreed.

1171
02:14:24,185 --> 02:14:26,665
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.

1172
02:14:37,826 --> 02:14:39,346
You're good fellows.

1173
02:14:39,666 --> 02:14:41,586
If only men were this good.

1174
02:14:43,866 --> 02:14:45,066
Remember, Altair. . .

1175
02:14:45,266 --> 02:14:47,826
. . .nine times around the circus.

1176
02:14:50,106 --> 02:14:51,306
Aldebaran.

1177
02:14:55,106 --> 02:14:57,147
Rigel, did you hear?

1178
02:14:57,347 --> 02:14:59,187
Nine lives to live.

1179
02:15:00,907 --> 02:15:02,827
My swift fellow.

1180
02:15:03,587 --> 02:15:06,907
You must not win the race
the first time around.

1181
02:15:07,547 --> 02:15:09,827
You win the last time around.

1182
02:15:11,107 --> 02:15:15,108
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.

1183
02:15:18,108 --> 02:15:20,348
Steady Antares.

1184
02:15:20,588 --> 02:15:22,028
Like a rock.

1185
02:15:23,468 --> 02:15:25,228
You will be our anchor.

1186
02:15:32,468 --> 02:15:35,069
I thought they'd never love
another as they love me.

1187
02:15:35,269 --> 02:15:37,549
They have taken me into their family.

1188
02:15:38,509 --> 02:15:40,309
Rest well, my stars.

1189
02:15:40,549 --> 02:15:42,509
Tomorrow we go up to the city.

1190
02:15:43,349 --> 02:15:47,309
Then if you defeat Messala and
the new governor there to see it. . .

1191
02:15:47,549 --> 02:15:50,309
. . .the news will scorch the streets
of the Roman world.

1192
02:15:50,549 --> 02:15:51,550
Pontius Pilate here?

1193
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:53,670
Yes, and ready to grind
his heel into us.

1194
02:15:53,870 --> 02:15:57,070
You will make him see
what men are born in this land.

1195
02:15:57,670 --> 02:16:00,910
I only know that
I race against Messala.

1196
02:16:16,511 --> 02:16:17,911
Look for the yoke.

1197
02:16:20,111 --> 02:16:21,591
Ease that strap.

1198
02:17:00,953 --> 02:17:05,513
God forgive me for seeking vengeance,
but my path is set.

1199
02:17:05,713 --> 02:17:09,994
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.

1200
02:17:24,795 --> 02:17:26,515
The Star of David.

1201
02:17:26,715 --> 02:17:29,715
To shine out for your people
and my people together. . .

1202
02:17:29,915 --> 02:17:31,955
. . .and blind the eyes of Rome.

1203
02:17:34,275 --> 02:17:35,075
They are ready.

1204
02:18:02,957 --> 02:18:04,877
Easy, girl, easy.

1205
02:18:42,879 --> 02:18:44,519
Number five.

1206
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:47,599
Where is number five?

1207
02:19:17,121 --> 02:19:20,881
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.

1208
02:19:21,201 --> 02:19:24,401
Yes, this is the day.

1209
02:19:27,481 --> 02:19:30,401
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.

1210
02:19:46,162 --> 02:19:49,602
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.

1211
02:20:00,763 --> 02:20:04,043
Hail, Jupiter. Give me victory.

1212
02:23:35,294 --> 02:23:37,895
Watch your line! Keep your places!

1213
02:24:01,176 --> 02:24:03,736
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.

1214
02:24:24,417 --> 02:24:25,657
Citizens. . .

1215
02:24:26,537 --> 02:24:31,057
. . .I welcome you to these games
in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.

1216
02:24:31,657 --> 02:24:34,178
We dedicate them to his glory. . .

1217
02:24:34,378 --> 02:24:36,818
. . .and to the glory of Rome. . .

1218
02:24:37,018 --> 02:24:39,578
. . .of which you are all part.

1219
02:24:42,738 --> 02:24:45,818
Let us honor those
who race for us today.

1220
02:24:46,298 --> 02:24:48,738
They come here from Alexandria. . .

1221
02:24:48,938 --> 02:24:50,098
. . .Messina. . .

1222
02:24:50,338 --> 02:24:51,618
. . .Carthage. . .

1223
02:24:51,818 --> 02:24:53,019
. . .Cyprus. . .

1224
02:24:53,219 --> 02:24:54,339
. . .Rome. . .

1225
02:24:54,659 --> 02:24:55,739
. . .Corinth. . .

1226
02:24:56,019 --> 02:24:57,299
. . .Athens. . .

1227
02:24:57,539 --> 02:24:58,699
. . .Phrygia. . .

1228
02:24:58,899 --> 02:25:00,579
. . .and Judea.

1229
02:25:08,419 --> 02:25:11,540
To the best of these,
a crown of victory.

1230
02:25:12,260 --> 02:25:14,300
The race begins.

1231
02:25:14,900 --> 02:25:17,060
Hail, Caesar!

1232
02:29:10,592 --> 02:29:12,592
Come, my children, come!

1233
02:29:28,913 --> 02:29:30,433
The Roman pig!

1234
02:35:46,814 --> 02:35:48,094
Salute.

1235
02:36:02,134 --> 02:36:03,815
A great victory.

1236
02:36:04,015 --> 02:36:06,535
You are the people's one true god. . .

1237
02:36:06,735 --> 02:36:08,295
. . .for the time being.

1238
02:36:08,855 --> 02:36:10,535
Permit us to worship.

1239
02:36:18,135 --> 02:36:20,535
I crown their god.

1240
02:36:39,656 --> 02:36:43,297
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.

1241
02:36:43,977 --> 02:36:48,017
A long life, young Arrius
and the good sense to live it.

1242
02:37:12,138 --> 02:37:14,298
We cannot wait, tribune.

1243
02:37:14,538 --> 02:37:16,738
He will come. He will--

1244
02:37:24,539 --> 02:37:26,539
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.

1245
02:37:26,739 --> 02:37:28,419
He will come!

1246
02:37:31,819 --> 02:37:33,219
He will come.

1247
02:37:33,939 --> 02:37:37,260
I've sent for him, and he will come.

1248
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:41,660
If you wish us to keep you alive,
we have to go to work now, tribune.

1249
02:37:42,380 --> 02:37:43,660
Do you understand?

1250
02:37:43,860 --> 02:37:45,900
To hack the legs off me?

1251
02:37:46,140 --> 02:37:49,700
Not yet. Not till I've seen him.

1252
02:37:50,260 --> 02:37:52,620
I don't receive him with half a body.

1253
02:38:05,901 --> 02:38:07,101
No!

1254
02:38:14,462 --> 02:38:17,382
I told you, Drusus. I told you.

1255
02:38:17,742 --> 02:38:19,302
Here he is.

1256
02:38:53,464 --> 02:38:55,904
Triumph complete, Judah.

1257
02:38:56,624 --> 02:38:59,544
The race won. The enemy destroyed.

1258
02:39:04,464 --> 02:39:06,464
I see no enemy.

1259
02:39:08,024 --> 02:39:09,785
What do you think you see?

1260
02:39:09,985 --> 02:39:12,785
The smashed body of a wretched animal?

1261
02:39:15,345 --> 02:39:18,945
There's enough of a man
still left here for you to hate.

1262
02:39:23,945 --> 02:39:25,705
Let me help you.

1263
02:39:39,626 --> 02:39:42,786
You think they're dead,
your mother and sister.

1264
02:39:43,626 --> 02:39:46,266
Dead. And the race over.

1265
02:39:48,467 --> 02:39:50,707
It isn't over, Judah.

1266
02:39:51,547 --> 02:39:52,667
They're not dead.

1267
02:39:58,107 --> 02:39:59,867
Where are they?

1268
02:40:10,908 --> 02:40:12,348
Where are they?

1269
02:40:16,028 --> 02:40:17,548
Where are they?!

1270
02:40:21,188 --> 02:40:22,828
Look for them. . .

1271
02:40:23,108 --> 02:40:26,669
. . .in the Valley of the Lepers. . .

1272
02:40:28,589 --> 02:40:31,189
. . .if you can recognize them.

1273
02:40:45,750 --> 02:40:47,350
It goes on.

1274
02:40:48,710 --> 02:40:50,750
It goes on, Judah.

1275
02:40:52,830 --> 02:40:54,190
The race. . . .

1276
02:40:56,470 --> 02:41:00,710
The race is not over.

1277
02:42:47,316 --> 02:42:49,116
Is there a way down here?

1278
02:42:49,436 --> 02:42:52,436
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.

1279
02:43:39,399 --> 02:43:40,559
Man.

1280
02:43:45,319 --> 02:43:49,000
I'm searching for two women,
a mother and daughter.

1281
02:43:52,480 --> 02:43:54,480
There are many women.

1282
02:43:56,040 --> 02:43:58,320
Of the family of Hur.

1283
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:02,360
We have no names here.

1284
02:44:59,403 --> 02:45:00,363
For them?

1285
02:45:05,484 --> 02:45:08,284
-Why did you say they were dead?
-It was what they wanted.

1286
02:45:08,484 --> 02:45:12,444
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?

1287
02:45:12,764 --> 02:45:14,404
Not to see them?

1288
02:45:14,684 --> 02:45:15,764
They are coming.

1289
02:45:15,964 --> 02:45:20,484
Love them in the way they must need
to be loved. Not to look at them.

1290
02:45:20,684 --> 02:45:23,285
Let them be as if you had
never come here. Please!

1291
02:46:34,608 --> 02:46:35,888
Is Judah well?

1292
02:46:37,169 --> 02:46:39,129
Is he happy?

1293
02:46:40,289 --> 02:46:43,169
Yes, he is well.

1294
02:46:46,289 --> 02:46:48,849
Your mind can be at rest for him.

1295
02:46:49,449 --> 02:46:51,049
He is well, Miriam.

1296
02:47:00,610 --> 02:47:02,050
God be with you.

1297
02:47:36,972 --> 02:47:38,332
They have gone.

1298
02:47:44,972 --> 02:47:46,452
We can go back.

1299
02:47:50,772 --> 02:47:53,373
Go back to what?

1300
02:47:55,693 --> 02:47:58,093
Judah, they have one blessing left.

1301
02:47:58,453 --> 02:48:01,573
To think you remember them
as they were. . .

1302
02:48:02,853 --> 02:48:04,773
. . .and live your own life.

1303
02:48:07,373 --> 02:48:09,053
Forget what is here.

1304
02:48:09,253 --> 02:48:10,414
Forget?

1305
02:48:13,254 --> 02:48:14,934
It's as though
they're alive in a grave.

1306
02:48:15,134 --> 02:48:17,734
-But what can you do?
-Undo what you've done.

1307
02:48:17,934 --> 02:48:21,254
How could you have suffered them
to come here? I must see them.

1308
02:48:21,454 --> 02:48:23,894
No, Judah, please! Judah!

1309
02:48:28,054 --> 02:48:32,255
Think, Judah, think. It would
tear them apart if they see you.

1310
02:49:37,938 --> 02:49:41,698
He is here. I have found Him.
The child has become a man.

1311
02:49:41,938 --> 02:49:46,019
And the man, I know it now,
is the Son of God.

1312
02:49:50,019 --> 02:49:51,739
The promise is true.

1313
02:49:52,939 --> 02:49:56,579
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.

1314
02:49:56,779 --> 02:49:58,779
Life has been answered.

1315
02:49:59,019 --> 02:50:00,819
God has answered it.

1316
02:50:15,260 --> 02:50:17,180
Come. Come with me.

1317
02:50:20,381 --> 02:50:22,741
When the Romans were marching me
to the galleys. . .

1318
02:50:22,941 --> 02:50:24,941
. . .thirst had nearly killed me.

1319
02:50:25,141 --> 02:50:27,781
A man gave me water to drink.

1320
02:50:28,021 --> 02:50:29,661
I went on living.

1321
02:50:30,021 --> 02:50:33,261
I should have done better
if I had poured it into the sand.

1322
02:50:33,461 --> 02:50:34,301
No.

1323
02:50:35,221 --> 02:50:36,701
I am thirsty still.

1324
02:50:37,421 --> 02:50:39,182
Come and listen.

1325
02:50:41,102 --> 02:50:43,062
I have business with Rome.

1326
02:50:44,822 --> 02:50:46,782
You insist on death.

1327
02:50:51,782 --> 02:50:53,262
Goodbye, Judah.

1328
02:52:41,908 --> 02:52:42,828
You sent for me?

1329
02:52:43,028 --> 02:52:45,908
I hope I bring you
a good conclusion to your victory.

1330
02:52:46,108 --> 02:52:49,148
I have a message for you
from the consul, your father.

1331
02:52:51,149 --> 02:52:54,109
-I honor him.
-As you may honor yourself.

1332
02:52:54,309 --> 02:52:56,509
You have been made a citizen of Rome.

1333
02:53:00,229 --> 02:53:02,269
Do you say nothing to this?

1334
02:53:04,949 --> 02:53:08,150
I have just come
from the Valley of Stone. . .

1335
02:53:08,350 --> 02:53:12,070
. . .where my mother and sister live
what's left of their lives.

1336
02:53:12,270 --> 02:53:16,950
By Rome's will,
lepers, outcasts without hope.

1337
02:53:17,190 --> 02:53:21,350
I have heard this. There was great
blame there, very deeply regretted.

1338
02:53:21,590 --> 02:53:26,070
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.

1339
02:53:26,270 --> 02:53:28,791
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.

1340
02:53:28,991 --> 02:53:32,311
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.

1341
02:53:32,511 --> 02:53:35,271
Before the cruelty of Rome
spread in his blood.

1342
02:53:35,471 --> 02:53:39,711
Rome destroyed Messala as surely
as Rome has destroyed my family.

1343
02:53:39,911 --> 02:53:43,991
Where there is greatness,
great government or power. . .

1344
02:53:44,191 --> 02:53:46,392
. . .even great feeling or compassion. . .

1345
02:53:46,632 --> 02:53:48,992
. . .error also is great.

1346
02:53:49,192 --> 02:53:51,192
We progress and mature by fault.

1347
02:53:51,392 --> 02:53:54,912
Rome has said she is ready to join
your life to hers in a great future.

1348
02:53:55,192 --> 02:53:56,592
There are other voices.

1349
02:53:56,792 --> 02:54:00,152
The voice, for instance, of Arrius
waiting for you in Rome.

1350
02:54:00,352 --> 02:54:02,752
He would tell you,
if I may speak in his place. . .

1351
02:54:03,232 --> 02:54:06,273
. . .not to crucify yourself
on a shadow such as old resentment. . .

1352
02:54:06,473 --> 02:54:08,513
. . .or impossible loyalties.

1353
02:54:08,713 --> 02:54:10,953
Perfect freedom has no existence.

1354
02:54:11,153 --> 02:54:13,953
A grown man knows the world
he lives in.

1355
02:54:14,153 --> 02:54:17,473
And for the present, the world is Rome.

1356
02:54:18,473 --> 02:54:20,753
Young Arrius, I am sure,
will choose it.

1357
02:54:22,754 --> 02:54:24,594
I am Judah Ben-Hur.

1358
02:54:36,234 --> 02:54:38,714
I cross this floor
in spoken friendship. . .

1359
02:54:38,914 --> 02:54:41,034
. . .as I would speak to Arrius.

1360
02:54:41,475 --> 02:54:44,995
But when I go up those stairs,
I become the hand of Caesar. . .

1361
02:54:45,195 --> 02:54:47,635
. . .ready to crush those
who challenge his authority.

1362
02:54:48,395 --> 02:54:50,475
There are too many men
of envy and ambition. . .

1363
02:54:50,715 --> 02:54:52,795
. . .who try to disrupt
the government of Rome.

1364
02:54:52,995 --> 02:54:55,475
You have become the victor
and hero to those people.

1365
02:54:56,035 --> 02:54:59,996
They look to you,
their one true god, as I call you.

1366
02:55:00,436 --> 02:55:04,236
If you stay here, you will find
yourself part of this tragedy.

1367
02:55:05,156 --> 02:55:08,076
I am already part of this tragedy.

1368
02:55:14,236 --> 02:55:16,236
Return this to Arrius.

1369
02:55:17,716 --> 02:55:20,157
I honor him too well
to wear it any longer.

1370
02:55:29,477 --> 02:55:31,597
Even for Arrius' sake,
I cannot protect you. . .

1371
02:55:31,797 --> 02:55:34,357
. . .from personal disaster
if you stay here.

1372
02:55:35,157 --> 02:55:37,117
You are too great a danger.

1373
02:55:52,278 --> 02:55:54,038
Leave Judea.

1374
02:55:55,798 --> 02:55:57,599
You have my word.

1375
02:56:30,440 --> 02:56:32,760
I was afraid
you would never come back. . .

1376
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:35,161
. . .afraid of what would happen to you.

1377
02:56:36,881 --> 02:56:38,801
But I see you again.

1378
02:56:41,161 --> 02:56:43,601
Your father's waiting for me.

1379
02:56:47,761 --> 02:56:48,921
Where is he?

1380
02:56:51,641 --> 02:56:52,882
What do you mean to do?

1381
02:57:03,682 --> 02:57:05,802
Rest, sleep.

1382
02:57:06,002 --> 02:57:09,162
For a few hours of the night
let your mind be at peace.

1383
02:57:09,362 --> 02:57:10,643
Peace?

1384
02:57:10,843 --> 02:57:12,723
Love and peace.

1385
02:57:12,923 --> 02:57:15,803
Do you think I don't long for them
as much as you do?

1386
02:57:16,123 --> 02:57:17,203
Where do you see them?

1387
02:57:18,683 --> 02:57:20,643
If you had heard this man
from Nazareth.

1388
02:57:20,843 --> 02:57:22,083
Balthasar's word.

1389
02:57:23,883 --> 02:57:26,363
He is more than Balthasar's word.

1390
02:57:26,883 --> 02:57:30,724
His voiced traveled
with such a still purpose.

1391
02:57:31,084 --> 02:57:33,084
It was more than a voice.

1392
02:57:33,964 --> 02:57:36,084
A man more than a man.

1393
02:57:39,644 --> 02:57:43,484
He said, "Blessed are the merciful. . .

1394
02:57:43,684 --> 02:57:45,884
. . .for they shall obtain mercy.

1395
02:57:46,724 --> 02:57:48,925
Blessed are the peacemakers. . .

1396
02:57:49,125 --> 02:57:52,125
. . .for they shall be called
the children of God. "

1397
02:57:52,685 --> 02:57:53,885
Children of God?

1398
02:57:54,885 --> 02:57:57,605
In that dead valley
where we left them?

1399
02:57:57,805 --> 02:58:01,445
I tell you every man of Judea is
unclean and will stay unclean. . .

1400
02:58:01,685 --> 02:58:04,725
. . .until we have scoured off
our bodies the crust and filth. . .

1401
02:58:04,925 --> 02:58:07,046
. . .of being at the mercy of tyranny.

1402
02:58:07,486 --> 02:58:10,926
No other life is possible
except to wash this land clean.

1403
02:58:11,126 --> 02:58:12,806
-In blood?
-Yes, in blood!

1404
02:58:14,926 --> 02:58:16,686
I know there is a law in life.

1405
02:58:16,886 --> 02:58:20,686
That blood begets more blood
as dog begets dog.

1406
02:58:20,926 --> 02:58:22,926
Death generates death. . .

1407
02:58:23,126 --> 02:58:25,647
. . .as the vulture breeds the vulture.

1408
02:58:26,367 --> 02:58:28,847
But the voice I heard today
on the hill said:

1409
02:58:29,047 --> 02:58:30,687
"Love your enemy.

1410
02:58:31,007 --> 02:58:34,047
Do good to those who
despitefully use you. "

1411
02:58:34,727 --> 02:58:38,087
All who are born in this land
hereafter can suffer as we have done.

1412
02:58:38,287 --> 02:58:40,487
As you make us do now.

1413
02:58:44,008 --> 02:58:46,288
Are we to bear nothing together?

1414
02:58:48,008 --> 02:58:49,288
Even love?

1415
02:58:52,848 --> 02:58:55,328
I can hardly draw breath. . .

1416
02:58:55,728 --> 02:58:57,888
. . .without feeling you in my heart.

1417
02:58:59,128 --> 02:59:00,528
But I know. . .

1418
02:59:02,168 --> 02:59:04,529
. . .that everything I do
from this moment. . .

1419
02:59:04,729 --> 02:59:07,769
. . .bears greater pain
than you have ever suffered.

1420
02:59:09,089 --> 02:59:11,169
It is better not to love me.

1421
02:59:12,689 --> 02:59:17,049
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?

1422
02:59:17,489 --> 02:59:20,329
You seem to be now the very thing
you set out to destroy. . .

1423
02:59:20,529 --> 02:59:24,810
. . .giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.

1424
02:59:25,010 --> 02:59:26,850
It's as though
you had become Messala.

1425
02:59:35,210 --> 02:59:37,210
I've lost you, Judah.

1426
03:00:37,254 --> 03:00:38,934
No further.

1427
03:00:39,854 --> 03:00:41,134
What are you doing here?

1428
03:00:41,854 --> 03:00:44,294
I was here last evening
waiting for you.

1429
03:00:44,494 --> 03:00:46,854
I have waited all night.
What has happened?

1430
03:00:47,734 --> 03:00:49,134
Where is Tirzah?

1431
03:00:52,214 --> 03:00:53,934
Leave the food.

1432
03:00:55,015 --> 03:00:57,655
I am coming closer. Don't be afraid.

1433
03:00:57,855 --> 03:01:00,135
-What are you doing?
-Don't be afraid.

1434
03:01:00,535 --> 03:01:03,055
I've heard Him again,
the man from Nazareth.

1435
03:01:03,255 --> 03:01:07,455
If ever words were from God,
they are in everything He says.

1436
03:01:07,695 --> 03:01:10,655
I cannot bear that
you should have never known. . .

1437
03:01:10,855 --> 03:01:14,536
. . .this hand of quiet
reaching towards us.

1438
03:01:14,936 --> 03:01:17,856
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.

1439
03:01:18,056 --> 03:01:20,376
Bring Tirzah
and we can go together to find Him.

1440
03:01:23,176 --> 03:01:25,296
Tirzah is dying.

1441
03:01:31,457 --> 03:01:33,897
Leave the food and go.

1442
03:01:36,017 --> 03:01:37,617
It's Judah.

1443
03:01:41,657 --> 03:01:43,697
Why did you tell him?

1444
03:01:44,457 --> 03:01:46,297
Yes, Judah, yes.

1445
03:01:46,897 --> 03:01:49,977
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.

1446
03:01:50,178 --> 03:01:51,178
Mother.

1447
03:01:53,978 --> 03:01:56,818
Wait, Mother, wait.

1448
03:01:57,018 --> 03:01:58,098
Let me talk with you.

1449
03:01:58,298 --> 03:01:59,658
Please.

1450
03:01:59,858 --> 03:02:02,338
No, no further. Please.

1451
03:02:02,538 --> 03:02:06,098
No, Judah. Son, no.

1452
03:02:06,818 --> 03:02:09,699
Mother, let me see Tirzah.

1453
03:02:09,899 --> 03:02:10,859
Tirzah is dying.

1454
03:02:21,099 --> 03:02:24,179
Judah, if they would see Jesus
of Nazareth they will know. . .

1455
03:02:24,379 --> 03:02:26,299
. . .that life is everlasting. . .

1456
03:02:26,499 --> 03:02:30,020
. . .and death is nothing to fear
if you have faith.

1457
03:02:32,540 --> 03:02:34,140
I will take them to Him.

1458
03:02:36,140 --> 03:02:37,180
No!

1459
03:02:38,020 --> 03:02:39,500
God, no!

1460
03:02:52,701 --> 03:02:55,501
No, no, dear son.

1461
03:02:56,501 --> 03:02:57,661
Mother. . .

1462
03:03:00,301 --> 03:03:01,781
. . .where is Tirzah?

1463
03:03:04,862 --> 03:03:05,822
Judah, no.

1464
03:03:07,382 --> 03:03:09,102
Judah, no.

1465
03:03:17,502 --> 03:03:20,262
You must not go to her, dear son.

1466
03:03:21,542 --> 03:03:22,822
Please.

1467
03:03:23,383 --> 03:03:24,863
Dear son.

1468
03:04:14,025 --> 03:04:15,625
I am afraid.

1469
03:04:16,545 --> 03:04:18,105
No cause.

1470
03:04:19,506 --> 03:04:21,826
The world is more than we know.

1471
03:04:56,548 --> 03:04:59,628
Tirzah, it's Judah.

1472
03:05:02,068 --> 03:05:03,828
No, Judah.

1473
03:05:45,710 --> 03:05:48,230
Alms for the blind?

1474
03:05:49,230 --> 03:05:51,790
Alms for the blind?

1475
03:05:54,791 --> 03:05:57,351
Alms for the blind?

1476
03:05:59,111 --> 03:06:03,231
-Why are the streets deserted?
-They have gone to the trial.

1477
03:06:03,431 --> 03:06:05,751
Trial? Whose trial?

1478
03:06:05,951 --> 03:06:09,111
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.

1479
03:06:09,311 --> 03:06:11,352
-This cannot be true.
-Alms?

1480
03:06:12,752 --> 03:06:14,032
What has he done?

1481
03:06:14,232 --> 03:06:17,832
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.

1482
03:06:18,032 --> 03:06:19,872
Help for the blind.

1483
03:06:20,072 --> 03:06:22,152
-Look, lepers!
-Lepers!

1484
03:06:23,472 --> 03:06:26,032
Get away! Stay away!

1485
03:06:27,312 --> 03:06:28,552
Go away!

1486
03:08:42,280 --> 03:08:44,320
Lepers! Lepers!

1487
03:09:05,001 --> 03:09:07,121
How can this be?

1488
03:09:15,841 --> 03:09:18,082
I know this man.

1489
03:09:31,642 --> 03:09:33,442
Will someone help Him?

1490
03:09:40,643 --> 03:09:41,883
Take pity on Him.

1491
03:09:49,003 --> 03:09:50,763
Have mercy.

1492
03:10:12,004 --> 03:10:13,845
In His pain. . .

1493
03:10:14,485 --> 03:10:16,765
. . .this look of peace.

1494
03:10:18,765 --> 03:10:20,565
Watch over them, Esther.

1495
03:10:57,047 --> 03:10:58,287
We must go back.

1496
03:10:58,487 --> 03:11:00,767
I brought you here to this. . .

1497
03:11:01,447 --> 03:11:03,087
. . .when I hoped. . . .

1498
03:11:05,887 --> 03:11:08,167
You haven't failed, Esther.

1499
03:11:25,968 --> 03:11:28,449
Hail King of the Jews!

1500
03:14:00,017 --> 03:14:03,417
This is where your search
has brought you, Balthasar.

1501
03:14:09,937 --> 03:14:11,657
He gave me water. . .

1502
03:14:12,417 --> 03:14:14,337
. . .and a heart to live.

1503
03:14:17,178 --> 03:14:18,978
What has He done to merit this?

1504
03:14:21,098 --> 03:14:24,698
He has taken the world
of our sins onto Himself.

1505
03:14:25,898 --> 03:14:28,658
To this end He said He was born. . .

1506
03:14:29,858 --> 03:14:31,698
. . .in that stable. . .

1507
03:14:32,378 --> 03:14:34,419
. . .where I first saw Him.

1508
03:14:37,899 --> 03:14:41,099
For this cause,
He came into the world.

1509
03:14:47,579 --> 03:14:49,259
For this death?

1510
03:14:51,939 --> 03:14:53,380
This beginning.

1511
03:15:24,581 --> 03:15:26,581
I have lived too long.

1512
03:15:56,423 --> 03:15:59,383
As though He were carrying
in that cross. . .

1513
03:15:59,583 --> 03:16:01,703
. . .the pain of the world.

1514
03:16:03,103 --> 03:16:07,464
So fearful, and yet why is it. . .

1515
03:16:07,664 --> 03:16:09,864
. . .I'm not afraid anymore?

1516
03:16:18,744 --> 03:16:20,984
The shadow of a storm.

1517
03:16:45,546 --> 03:16:47,706
A strange darkness. . .

1518
03:16:47,906 --> 03:16:49,786
. . .but still day.

1519
03:16:58,386 --> 03:17:00,506
His life is over.

1520
03:17:20,907 --> 03:17:22,148
What is it?

1521
03:17:30,868 --> 03:17:32,428
This tearing.

1522
03:17:33,308 --> 03:17:35,108
I am in pain.

1523
03:17:36,028 --> 03:17:37,988
I feel it too.

1524
03:18:21,031 --> 03:18:22,751
Do you see your hand?

1525
03:20:54,719 --> 03:20:57,079
Almost at the moment He died. . .

1526
03:20:58,519 --> 03:21:01,879
. . .I heard Him say,
"Father, forgive them. . .

1527
03:21:02,079 --> 03:21:04,319
. . .for they know not what they do. "

1528
03:21:06,440 --> 03:21:07,920
Even then.

1529
03:21:08,160 --> 03:21:09,560
Even then.

1530
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:19,320
And I felt His voice take
the sword out of my hand.
