1
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:21,813
<i>My name is Max.</i>

2
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,275
<i>My world is fire and blood.</i>

3
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:27,694
<i>Why are you hurting these people?</i>

4
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,279
<i>It's the oil, stupid.</i>

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,990
<i>- Oil wars.
- We are killing for guzzoline.</i>

6
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,909
<i>The world is running out of water.</i>

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,911
<i>Now there's the water wars.</i>

8
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:39,998
<i>Once, I was a cop.</i>

9
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,792
<i>A road warrior searching
for a righteous cause.</i>

10
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:44,628
<i>...to the terminal freak-out point.</i>

11
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,964
<i>Mankind has gone rogue, terrorizing itself.</i>

12
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:49,549
<i>Thermonuclear skirmish.</i>

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,967
<i>The earth is sour.</i>

14
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,469
<i>Our bones are poisoned.</i>

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,679
<i>We have become half-life.</i>

16
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,557
<i>As the world fell...</i>

17
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,727
<i>...each of us, in our own way,
was broken.</i>

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,439
<i>It was hard to know
who was more crazy:</i>

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,609
<i>Me...</i>

20
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,736
<i>...or everyone else.</i>

21
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,573
<i>Hello?</i>

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,619
<i>Where are you?</i>

23
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:26,169
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,380
<i>- Here they come again.
- Max Rockatansky.</i>

25
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:31,800
<i>Worming their way
into the black matter of my brain.</i>

26
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:34,052
- Help us, Max.
- You promised to help us.

27
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:40,225
<i>I tell myself...</i>

28
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,560
<i>...they cannot touch me.</i>

29
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,231
<i>They are long dead.</i>

30
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:45,165
<i>I am the one...</i>

31
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,501
<i>...who runs from both
the living and the dead.</i>

32
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,921
<i>Hunted by scavengers.</i>

33
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,467
<i>Haunted by those I could not protect.</i>

34
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,354
<i>So I exist in this wasteland.</i>

35
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,404
<i>A man reduced to a single instinct:</i>

36
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,573
<i>Survive.</i>

37
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:39,863
Max?

38
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:40,989
Is that you?

39
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:42,991
Where were you?

40
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,078
Help us. Where were you?

41
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,121
Where were you, Max?

42
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,097
Where were you, Max?

43
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:07,348
Stop running.

44
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,517
You let us die!

45
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,437
You let us die!

46
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:13,897
You let us die!

47
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,690
You promised to help us!

48
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,733
Why?

49
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,170
Witness!

50
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,590
I got him.

51
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,808
We are War Boys!

52
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:32,976
War Boys!

53
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,061
Kamakrazee War Boys!

54
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,104
War Boys!

55
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,481
Fucacima kamakrazee...

56
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,024
...War Boys!

57
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,235
Hooked on!

58
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:43,903
Today we're heading...

59
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,488
...to Gas Town!

60
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,073
Gas Town!

61
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,325
Today we're hauling Aqua Cola.

62
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:51,369
Aqua Cola!

63
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,414
- Today we're hauling produce!
- Produce!

64
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,082
And today we're hauling...

65
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,542
...Mother's Milk!

66
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,294
Mother's Milk!

67
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:27,488
<i>Joe! Joe! Joe! Immortan Joe!</i>

68
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,386
Rev it up for the Immortan Joe!

69
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:03,650
Once again, we send off my War Rig
to bring back...

70
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,235
...guzzoline from Gas Town...

71
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,238
...and bullets from the Bullet Farm!

72
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:13,451
Once again, I salute my Imperator...

73
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,328
...Furiosa!

74
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,496
And I salute...

75
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,374
...my half-life War Boys...

76
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,959
...who will ride with me eternal...

77
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,587
...on the highways of Valhalla.

78
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,215
<i>V8! V8! V8! V8!</i>

79
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,093
I am your redeemer.

80
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,679
It is by my hand...

81
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,973
...you will rise from the ashes...

82
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,183
...of this world!

83
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,819
It's coming. Get ready.

84
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,031
Yes. Yes. Yes. It's coming.

85
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,715
Do not, my friends...

86
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,092
...become addicted to water.

87
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,927
It will take hold of you...

88
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,139
...and you will resent its absence.

89
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,499
Clear off!

90
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,085
Get them all off!

91
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,629
Clear off!

92
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,672
Get them all off.

93
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,759
Get off!

94
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,183
Signal Gas Town. Convoy's on its way.

95
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,377
I got a War Boy...

96
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,379
...running on empty.

97
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,673
Hook up that full-life.

98
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,929
Hey! Careful. That's a universal donor.

99
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,530
Boss, we're not going to Gas Town?

100
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,451
Bullet Farm?

101
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,496
We're heading east.

102
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,250
I'll pass it down the line.

103
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,377
New orders!

104
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,296
Thunder up! Thunder up!

105
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,006
This is not a supply run!

106
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:38,966
Go. Go.

107
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,761
- Ace, what's going on?
- Go. We're heading east.

108
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,388
- Why?
- I don't know. That's the order.

109
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,032
Moo.

110
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,325
- Hey, Pa.
- Hmm?

111
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,118
You know about this?

112
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,538
Your produce ain't going to Gas Town.

113
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,008
She's gone off-road...

114
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,302
...into hostile territory.

115
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,555
Why would she do that?

116
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,475
Let me see.

117
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,434
Rictus.

118
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,144
- I wanna see.
- Rictus.

119
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,647
Go see what's agitating Dad.

120
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,218
Splendid!

121
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,096
Angharad!

122
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,565
Where are they?

123
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,650
They are not your property.

124
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:20,693
Miss Giddy?

125
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,695
You cannot own a human being.

126
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,157
Sooner or later someone pushes back!

127
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,492
Where is she taking them?

128
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,953
She didn't take them.
They begged her to go!

129
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,498
Where is she taking them?

130
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,542
A long way from you.

131
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,028
Hey. Hey, what's happening?

132
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,323
Slit!

133
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,492
What's going on? Slit!

134
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,453
Treason. Betrayal.
An Imperator gone rogue.

135
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:13,370
An Imperator.

136
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:14,205
Who?

137
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,291
Furiosa! She took a lot of stuff
from Immortan Joe.

138
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,375
What stuff?

139
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,753
Breeders! His prize breeders!

140
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,506
He wants them back!
Not a hand laid on them.

141
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,389
By my deeds I honor him.

142
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,724
V8.

143
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,313
<i>V8! V8! V8!</i>

144
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:46,487
That's my wheel.

145
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:47,530
I'm driving.

146
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,739
You're my lancer.

147
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,366
I just promoted myself.

148
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,159
Not today. Today is my day.

149
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,202
Look at you.

150
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,287
If you can't stand up,
you can't do war.

151
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:56,789
He's right, son.

152
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,208
I'm not staying here dying soft.

153
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,960
You're already a corpse.

154
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,379
- I just need a top-up. More juice.
- No time!

155
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,172
We take my Blood Bag.

156
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,633
We take my Blood Bag
and strap him to the lancer's perch.

157
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,426
It's got a muzzle on it. It's feral.

158
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:10,261
That's right.

159
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,721
High-octane crazy blood
filling me up.

160
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:18,686
If I'm gonna die...

161
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,106
...I'm gonna die historic
on the Fury Road.

162
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,531
Yeah. Yeah.

163
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:34,034
- Organic, hitch up his Blood Bag.
- Eh?

164
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,494
Right-o.

165
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,173
How much more can they take from me?

166
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,633
They've got my blood. Now it's my car!

167
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,714
Immortan!

168
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,592
Immortan Joe!

169
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,930
He looked at me!

170
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,433
- He looked right at me!
- He looked at your Blood Bag!

171
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,977
He turned his head.
He looked me in the eye.

172
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,396
He was scanning the horizon.

173
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:45,898
No.

174
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,316
I am awaited.

175
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,944
I am awaited in Valhalla!

176
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,531
<i>Confucamus!</i>

177
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:57,993
Immortan!

178
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:00,871
Yeah!

179
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,017
Hey! Heads up!

180
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,227
Heads up!

181
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,108
Boss!

182
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,068
We got vehicles from the Citadel.

183
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,611
They're firing flares.

184
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,363
They want reinforcements
from Gas Town...

185
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,198
...and the Bullet Farm.

186
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,199
What is this?

187
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,784
Backup? Decoy?

188
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,704
It's a detour.

189
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:14,862
Eyes right!

190
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,283
Buzzards!

191
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,453
- Buzzards right! Eyes on! Eyes on!
- Buzzards right!

192
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:23,787
- Eyes on!
- Eyes on!

193
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,626
Should we turn it around
and run them into our backup?

194
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,838
No! We're good!

195
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,049
We fang it!

196
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,512
Thunder up! Here we go!

197
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,434
Prepare the gunners!

198
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:15,381
Morsov!

199
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,010
Come on, attack!

200
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:33,607
War!

201
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,700
Ready!

202
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,371
She's ours, Slit!

203
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,247
She's ours.

204
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,916
First, we get the Buzzards off her back!

205
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:39,631
Form up!

206
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,179
That's my head!

207
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,549
Get up! You can do it!

208
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:28,805
Morsov!

209
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,351
- Morsov!
- No!

210
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,311
- Witness me!
- Witness!

211
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,395
Witness!

212
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,730
Aah!

213
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,069
Fly!

214
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:47,366
Witness!

215
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:48,325
Witness!

216
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,995
Mediocre, Morsov!

217
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,456
- Mediocre!
- Hoorah!

218
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,604
Aah!

219
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:25,946
Get ready!

220
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:28,865
Back me in!

221
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,246
They're coming!

222
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,974
We can't breathe down there!

223
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,100
Stay out of sight!

224
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:56,810
Now!

225
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,440
Aah!

226
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,490
Go back!

227
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:12,409
Where's he going?

228
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,243
Hydraulics!

229
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,453
Hydraulics!

230
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,166
Aah!

231
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,809
Yeah.

232
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,150
Now we bring home the booty.

233
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,679
She thinks she can lose us, Dad.

234
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,764
She thinks we're stupid.

235
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,392
She thinks she can lose us in there!

236
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,036
Fang it!

237
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,038
Fang it!

238
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,129
Why can't you stop?

239
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,132
Crew! Out of the way!

240
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,091
Out of the way!

241
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,551
What have you done?

242
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:53,927
What have you done?

243
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:58,390
Yeah.

244
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,993
We need counterweight.
Get the Blood Bag down the back.

245
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,506
Hunt them down! Hunt them down!

246
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,325
Hey, head!

247
00:26:58,576 --> 00:26:59,743
Say bye-bye to the neck!

248
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:01,870
We're going in!

249
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,352
Come on! We've almost got her!

250
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,487
Come on! Hold it steady!

251
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:46,308
Oh, what a day!

252
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,310
What a lovely day!

253
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:08,538
I am the man...

254
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,124
...who grabs the sun...

255
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,670
...riding to Valhalla!

256
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:19,132
Witness me...

257
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,175
...Blood Bag!

258
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,847
Witness!

259
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,998
I live, I die, I live again!

260
00:29:58,589 --> 00:29:59,589
Aah!

261
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,472
We're not going back.

262
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:05,960
Water.

263
00:34:59,014 --> 00:34:59,639
Ah.

264
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:02,809
You.

265
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,702
Angharad, is that just the wind...

266
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,121
...or is that a furious vexation?

267
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,684
Ugh!

268
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,045
I got it!

269
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:05,681
Aah!

270
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:38,423
Glory me, Blood Bag!
We snagged her alive.

271
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:41,008
He's gonna shred her. Shred her.

272
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,593
Bolt cutters.

273
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,262
Chain.

274
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:47,098
Hey, hey!

275
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,395
Oh, look at them.

276
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:55,231
So shiny. So chrome.

277
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:56,941
He's gonna be so grateful.

278
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:59,402
We could ask for anything.

279
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,238
I wanna drive the War Rig.

280
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,450
- What are you gonna ask for?
- That's my jacket.

281
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,410
Heh, heh. Sure.

282
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:11,247
- You can ask for more than a jacket.
- We're going to the Green Place.

283
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,207
Wait, it's you and me. Ugh!

284
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:29,307
We're going to the Green Place
of Many Mothers.

285
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:49,452
How does it feel?

286
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:51,871
- It hurts.
- Out here, everything hurts.

287
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,501
You wanna get through this?

288
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:01,214
Do as I say.

289
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,471
Now pick up what you can and run.

290
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,270
Tsa!

291
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,473
Kill switches.

292
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,643
I set the sequence myself.

293
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,812
This Rig goes nowhere without me.

294
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,942
You can get in.

295
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,736
Not without them.

296
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,329
So we wait.

297
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,674
You're relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man.

298
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,885
You've damaged one of his wives.
How grateful do you think he's gonna be?

299
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:40,187
You're sitting on 2000 horsepower
of nitro-boosted war machine.

300
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:43,524
I'd say you got
about a five-minute head start.

301
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:53,326
You want that thing off your face?

302
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:07,214
Let's go.

303
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,147
Ah, uh-uh.

304
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:55,262
Of all the legs you had to shoot,
that one was attached to his favorite.

305
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:16,951
Smeg!

306
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:38,973
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.

307
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,517
- What choice does she have?
- He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.

308
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:42,685
- Why?
- To bargain.

309
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:43,936
Oh, he'll hurt us.

310
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,938
Think he's coming to the Green Place?

311
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,231
Never! He's a crazy smeg...

312
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,108
...who eats schlanger!

313
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:16,927
Nah, stay out of there.

314
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,262
Behind you.

315
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,014
Huh?

316
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,560
The Gas Town Boys.

317
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,189
Don't damage the goods.

318
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,113
What do you see?

319
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,867
Big Rigs...

320
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:42,953
...Polecats...

321
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:44,747
...Flamers...

322
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:49,168
...and there's the People Eater himself.

323
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,296
Coming to count the cost.

324
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,506
Hmm.

325
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:06,477
Aah!

326
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,564
We're dragging something out back.

327
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:12,149
I think it's the fuel pod.

328
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:13,859
No, no.

329
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,111
I'll go.

330
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:41,822
- Filth! You traitored him!
- Ah!

331
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:47,912
No unnecessary killing!

332
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:49,955
- This War Boy wants me dead!
- We agreed!

333
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:52,499
He's kamakrazee!

334
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,960
He's just a kid
at the end of his half-life!

335
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,254
No! I live. I die. I live again!

336
00:45:58,006 --> 00:45:59,548
- Hold him!
- Tie him up!

337
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:00,674
Throw him out!

338
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:02,259
Chuck him out!

339
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,054
You got more friends.

340
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,807
Bullet Farmer.

341
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:11,226
- They're coming from the Bullet Farm.
- Yeah?

342
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:14,146
It's over. You can't defy him.

343
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,397
Just watch us, mate!

344
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:16,440
He is the one...

345
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,817
- ...who grabbed the sun.
- Look how slick he's fooled you.

346
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:20,611
- He's a lying old man.
- By his hand...

347
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:22,696
- ...we'll be lifted up!
- That's why we have...

348
00:46:22,948 --> 00:46:24,490
...his logo seared on our backs!

349
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:26,367
"Breeding Stock!" "Battle Fodder!"

350
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:27,534
No, I am awaited!

351
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:30,079
- You're an old man's "Battle Fodder"!
- Killing everyone...

352
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,705
- ...and everything.
- We're not to blame!

353
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:33,791
Then who killed the world?

354
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:03,904
I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage.

355
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,490
I don't know if it's still any good.

356
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,367
Get back in the hold!

357
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:10,160
Keep the hatch open.

358
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:18,419
I need you here.

359
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:22,297
You may have to drive the Rig.

360
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:25,092
Mm.

361
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:28,470
You.

362
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:30,931
You stay.

363
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:33,225
You stay there.

364
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:39,189
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

365
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:41,233
I'm supposed to be alone.

366
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,985
That was the deal.

367
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:50,784
Down here.

368
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:12,514
Hey.

369
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,808
What's your name?

370
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:17,686
What do I call you?

371
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:20,272
Does it matter?

372
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:23,734
Fine.

373
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:25,360
When I yell "fool"...

374
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:27,905
...you drive out of here
as fast as you can.

375
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:31,033
This is the sequence:

376
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:33,494
One. One, two.

377
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:34,787
One.

378
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,873
Red. Black. Go.

379
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,792
You have it?

380
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,753
It's all here!

381
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,966
Three thousand gallons of guzzoline,
just like you asked!

382
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:16,722
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

383
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:20,225
You drop the rocks.

384
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,152
You said:

385
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:31,862
"A few vehicles in pursuit.

386
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,572
Maybe."

387
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:35,032
We count three War Parties!

388
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,785
Yeah, well, I got unlucky.

389
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,746
Let's do this!

390
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,398
Fool!

391
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,774
That's our fuel!

392
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,499
Make way for the Ripsaw!

393
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:12,963
Come on! Move them!

394
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:23,807
Once I'm over...

395
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,268
...clear the rocks
and bring everyone through.

396
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:27,477
Immortan!

397
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:29,771
Immortan Joe!

398
00:52:30,023 --> 00:52:33,275
I got a War Boy!
Says he was on the War Rig.

399
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:37,571
You! Climb aboard!

400
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:41,074
Hey. Hey!

401
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,285
I got his boot!

402
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:45,537
I got the Blood Bag's boot!

403
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:47,456
Take me!

404
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,291
I got his boot!

405
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:53,920
All this for a family squabble.

406
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,590
Healthy babies.

407
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:52,873
Aah!

408
00:55:04,886 --> 00:55:05,844
Reload the clip.

409
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:07,220
I can't.

410
00:55:14,437 --> 00:55:15,103
Gun!

411
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:17,606
Gimme the gun!

412
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:18,440
Not loaded yet!

413
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:19,316
Now!

414
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,150
We had a deal!

415
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:23,320
Ugh!

416
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:10,617
Rictus!

417
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:12,118
The wives!

418
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:13,703
No more flames.

419
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:21,711
Splendid!

420
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,338
Splendid!

421
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:24,464
That's my child!

422
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:27,092
My property!

423
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:30,011
Immorta...

424
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,608
Immortan. If I get on the Rig,
there's a way inside.

425
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,819
- What is your name?
- It's Nux.

426
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:48,488
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing.

427
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,698
No.

428
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:51,575
Put a bullet in her skull.

429
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:54,536
Stop the Rig,
return my treasures to me...

430
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,205
...and I, myself, will carry you...

431
00:56:57,832 --> 00:56:58,915
...to the Gates...

432
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,417
...of Valhalla.

433
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:02,168
Am I awaited?

434
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,462
You will ride eternal...

435
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,007
...shiny and chrome.

436
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:09,718
Rictus!

437
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,053
Help him aboard!

438
00:57:14,223 --> 00:57:14,806
Ready?

439
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,683
Here we go!

440
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,484
Aah!

441
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:29,237
Mediocre!

442
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:01,102
Schlanger!

443
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,541
Look out!

444
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:26,544
Angharad!

445
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:28,254
Get out!

446
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:50,819
No!

447
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:51,986
Angharad!

448
00:59:06,836 --> 00:59:09,087
Stop! Turn the Rig around!

449
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,506
Go back for her!

450
00:59:12,842 --> 00:59:13,758
No.

451
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:15,510
Tell him to turn the Rig around!

452
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,803
Did you see it?

453
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,264
She went under the wheels.

454
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:20,890
Did you see it?

455
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,269
She went under the wheels.

456
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:26,646
We keep moving.

457
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:27,939
- No!
- We keep moving!

458
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,817
He doesn't know what he's talking about!

459
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,069
Whatever happens,
we're going to the Green Place.

460
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,697
The stupid Green Place.
We don't even know where to find it!

461
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,795
- You all right?
- On! On!

462
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,043
Cheedo!

463
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:31,961
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

464
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:32,962
Stop!

465
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:34,756
He'll forgive us. I know he will.

466
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:36,174
There is no going back!

467
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:38,092
- We were his treasures!
- Cheedo!

468
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:41,221
We were protected! He gave us the high life!

469
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:44,224
- What's wrong with that?
- We are not things.

470
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:45,225
No!

471
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:47,644
We are not things!

472
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,145
We are not things.

473
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:52,315
- I don't want to hear that again!
- They were her words!

474
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:53,733
And now she's dead!

475
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,277
Wring your hands and tear your hair...

476
01:00:56,529 --> 01:00:57,987
...but you're not going back.

477
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,240
You're not going back to him.

478
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:01,407
Angharad!

479
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,535
Come on! Come on!

480
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,263
So, um, ahem...

481
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:25,139
...where is this...

482
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,226
...Green Place?

483
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,479
It's a long night's run, heading east.

484
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,108
We need inventory.

485
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,734
Match every gun with its bullets.

486
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:43,408
I'm gonna go and do some repairs.

487
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,076
We need someone down the back.

488
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:46,077
I'll go.

489
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:47,036
No.

490
01:01:47,288 --> 01:01:49,038
I want you to stay together.

491
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:50,874
I can do it.

492
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:25,199
What are you doing here?

493
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:27,869
He saw it.

494
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:29,871
He saw it all.

495
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,791
My own Blood Bag driving the Rig
that killed her.

496
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,759
Stop doing that.

497
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,095
Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

498
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:47,430
Stop.

499
01:02:57,566 --> 01:03:00,360
Three times the gates were open to me.

500
01:03:00,653 --> 01:03:01,653
What gates?

501
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:04,155
I was awaited in Valhalla.

502
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:05,990
They were calling my name.

503
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:10,536
I should be walking with the Immorta.
McFeasting with the heroes of all time.

504
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,960
I'd say it was your manifest destiny not to.

505
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:21,464
I thought I was being spared
for something great.

506
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:25,176
I got to drive a pursuit vehicle.

507
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:29,138
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.

508
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:31,182
Who are Larry and Barry?

509
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:33,309
My mates.

510
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:35,144
Larry and Barry.

511
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:39,774
If they don't get me,
then the Night Fevers will.

512
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:08,094
Well, we've only got four for Big Boy here,
so he's all but useless.

513
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:10,638
But...

514
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:14,892
...we can squirt off this little pinky
a raunchy 29 times.

515
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:19,439
Angharad used to call them Antiseed.

516
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,608
Plant one and watch something die.

517
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,436
Hold on, mate.

518
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,998
We are down
30,000 units of guzzoline...

519
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:04,127
...19 canisters of nitro, 12 assault bikes...

520
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:05,878
...seven pursuit vehicles.

521
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,005
The deficit mounts.

522
01:06:08,257 --> 01:06:09,340
And now, sir...

523
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:12,552
...you have us stuck in a quagmire.

524
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:14,262
Hey, Joe!

525
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,264
Boss!

526
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,518
Your girly's breathing her last!

527
01:06:21,145 --> 01:06:23,062
What about the child?

528
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:33,781
Are you coming, brother?

529
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,116
Wait!

530
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:37,952
It's gone awful quiet in there.

531
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:39,370
Get it out.

532
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:40,872
Get it out!

533
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:45,835
Come on! I've been called to the torture!

534
01:06:46,587 --> 01:06:47,587
Patience!

535
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:51,883
Oh, you stay here with your grief, Daddy.

536
01:06:52,134 --> 01:06:55,303
- I'll fetch them for you.
- Be careful! Protect the assets!

537
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,183
Just one angry shot...

538
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:02,476
...for Furiosa.

539
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:03,686
Hut!

540
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:04,896
Yeah!

541
01:07:11,195 --> 01:07:13,654
Crying shame. Heh.

542
01:07:13,906 --> 01:07:15,031
Come.

543
01:07:16,158 --> 01:07:17,033
Another month...

544
01:07:17,993 --> 01:07:19,827
...could have been your viable human!

545
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,412
Was it a male?

546
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:23,247
Your A-1 Alpha prime.

547
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:27,752
Hey, Rictus!

548
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,796
You lost a baby brother!

549
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,009
Perfect in every way.

550
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,347
I had a baby brother!

551
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:41,724
I had a little baby brother!

552
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,768
And he was perfect!

553
01:07:44,019 --> 01:07:45,895
Perfect in every way!

554
01:08:16,635 --> 01:08:17,760
Come on.

555
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:28,854
Wouldn't wanna shoot the wives, sir.

556
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:30,189
Just probing.

557
01:08:41,535 --> 01:08:43,119
He wants to help!

558
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:44,161
Who?

559
01:08:44,413 --> 01:08:45,746
The War Boy!

560
01:08:45,998 --> 01:08:47,415
Where did he come from?

561
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:49,000
I thought we threw him off the Rig!

562
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:54,505
There's high ground...

563
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:56,632
- ...just beyond that thing.
- He means the tree.

564
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:58,551
Yeah. Tree!

565
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:00,803
Leave him to me.

566
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:04,557
Say, anyone notice that bright light?
Encroaching gunfire?

567
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:05,933
Get out.

568
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:07,310
I can do this. I know this machine.

569
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:09,145
He does. He's a Revhead.

570
01:09:14,735 --> 01:09:15,735
You've got two left!

571
01:09:22,117 --> 01:09:23,242
On him.

572
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:42,470
Don't breathe.

573
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,722
Ugh!

574
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:47,016
Hey!

575
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:48,601
Hey! Hey!

576
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:49,852
War Boy!

577
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,688
I'm gonna use the winch
around the tree thing!

578
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:54,774
Take this.

579
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:56,734
Let's get the engine plates.

580
01:09:57,986 --> 01:09:58,944
You drive the Rig!

581
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:01,030
- Hold up a flare!
- I am holding a flare!

582
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:04,200
- Closer!
- It's right in front of your eyes!

583
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:06,202
Aah!

584
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,255
Hut! Hut!

585
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:25,846
Blood Bag!

586
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:34,688
I am the scales of justice!

587
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:37,525
Conductor of the choir of death!

588
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:40,403
Sing, Brother Heckler.

589
01:10:42,072 --> 01:10:43,656
Sing, Brother Koch!

590
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:50,162
Sing, brothers, sing! Sing!

591
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:52,331
Don't they know they're shooting at us?

592
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:08,556
Gun fever!

593
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,128
I never thought I'd do something
as shine as that.

594
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,130
How are the engines?

595
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,216
Very hot and real thirsty.

596
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:34,099
Hey. You need to take the War Rig
half a klick down the track.

597
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:38,187
What if you're not back by the time
the engines have cooled?

598
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:41,941
Well, you keep moving.

599
01:12:51,368 --> 01:12:53,410
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

600
01:12:54,496 --> 01:12:56,038
Retaliate first.

601
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:00,626
Let's go!

602
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:23,000
- Are you hurt?
- Huh?

603
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:24,460
You're bleeding.

604
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:26,670
That's not his blood.

605
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:29,840
What is this?

606
01:14:30,759 --> 01:14:31,925
It's Mother's Milk.

607
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:15,469
It's okay.

608
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,762
Sleep.

609
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:19,473
Get some rest.

610
01:15:29,943 --> 01:15:32,528
How do you know this place even exists?

611
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:36,699
I was born there.

612
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,077
So why'd you leave?

613
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:41,662
I didn't.

614
01:15:43,248 --> 01:15:45,165
I was taken as a child.

615
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:48,043
Stolen.

616
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:55,801
You done this before?

617
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:57,845
Many times.

618
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,140
Now that I drive a War Rig...

619
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:04,893
...this is the best shot I'll ever have.

620
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:07,146
And them?

621
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,691
They're looking for hope.

622
01:16:11,735 --> 01:16:13,110
What about you?

623
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:19,867
Redemption.

624
01:17:03,328 --> 01:17:05,746
Hey, what's that?

625
01:17:18,343 --> 01:17:20,469
I remember something like that.

626
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:34,274
Help me!

627
01:17:37,362 --> 01:17:38,946
Help me!

628
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:43,742
- Help me, please!
- Uh, uh.

629
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,244
Please!

630
01:17:45,954 --> 01:17:47,079
That's bait.

631
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:49,915
Stay in the Rig.

632
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:58,048
Hurry! Please, hurry! They'll be back!

633
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:00,300
I am one of...

634
01:18:00,552 --> 01:18:01,802
...the Vuvalini!

635
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:04,555
Of the Many Mothers!

636
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,351
My Initiate Mother was K.T. Concannon!

637
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,188
I am the daughter of Mary Jabassa.

638
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:17,234
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

639
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:05,741
It's me.

640
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,542
There's something in the eyes.

641
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,170
Perhaps it is Jabassa's child.

642
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:24,176
This is our Furiosa.

643
01:19:27,722 --> 01:19:29,097
How long has it been?

644
01:19:30,725 --> 01:19:32,100
Seven thousand days.

645
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:34,811
Plus the ones I don't remember.

646
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,272
Furiosa.

647
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,359
What happened to your mother?

648
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:43,153
She died.

649
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:45,656
On the third day.

650
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:53,914
From where did you come?

651
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:58,001
The West. Citadel. Beyond the mountains.

652
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:02,923
The men.

653
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:04,341
Who are they?

654
01:20:04,592 --> 01:20:05,926
They're reliable.

655
01:20:06,344 --> 01:20:08,011
They helped us get here.

656
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:22,109
Where did you find such creatures?

657
01:20:24,696 --> 01:20:25,988
So soft.

658
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:28,115
This one has all her teeth!

659
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:34,788
Oh.

660
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:39,334
I can't wait for them to see it.

661
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:41,086
See?

662
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:43,505
See what?

663
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,007
Home.

664
01:20:49,012 --> 01:20:50,512
The Green Place.

665
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,889
But if you came from the West...

666
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:55,475
...you passed it.

667
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:58,270
The crows.

668
01:20:58,563 --> 01:21:01,064
The creepy place with all the crows.

669
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,483
- The soil.
- We had to get out.

670
01:21:03,735 --> 01:21:05,527
- We had no water.
- The water was filth.

671
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,404
It was poisoned. It was sour.

672
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,031
And then the crows came.

673
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:11,033
We couldn't grow anything.

674
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:12,617
Where are the others?

675
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:13,827
What others?

676
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:15,245
The Many Mothers.

677
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:16,997
We're the only ones left.

678
01:22:17,934 --> 01:22:19,059
Look.

679
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:24,022
That's what you call a satellite.

680
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:27,025
Miss Giddy told us about those.

681
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:30,445
They used to bounce messages
across the Earth.

682
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:32,781
Shows.

683
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,325
Everyone in the old world
had a show.

684
01:22:37,662 --> 01:22:38,495
Do you think there's still...

685
01:22:38,746 --> 01:22:40,038
...somebody out there?

686
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:42,791
Sending shows?

687
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:44,417
Who knows?

688
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:47,796
Those are the Plains of Silence.

689
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:52,467
Stay right where you are, little Joe.

690
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,845
Kind of lost its novelty out here.

691
01:22:55,096 --> 01:22:56,680
You having a baby?

692
01:22:57,765 --> 01:22:59,224
Warlord Junior.

693
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:00,725
Gonna be so ugly.

694
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:02,769
It could be a girl.

695
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:06,231
You kill people with that, do you?

696
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:08,567
Killed everyone I ever met out here.

697
01:23:08,818 --> 01:23:11,153
Headshots. All of them.
Snap. Right in the medulla.

698
01:23:11,404 --> 01:23:13,363
Thought somehow you girls
were above that.

699
01:23:17,994 --> 01:23:19,161
Come here.

700
01:23:26,878 --> 01:23:27,878
Take a peek.

701
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,130
Seeds.

702
01:23:31,132 --> 01:23:32,591
These are from home.

703
01:23:32,842 --> 01:23:35,010
Heirlooms. The real thing.

704
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,512
I plant one every chance I get.

705
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:38,763
Where?

706
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:42,058
So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.

707
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:44,144
Aah. So many different kinds.

708
01:23:44,437 --> 01:23:46,479
Trees, flowers, fruit.

709
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,566
Back then, everyone had their fill.

710
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:52,485
Back then,
there was no need to snap anybody.

711
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:08,960
Can I talk to you?

712
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:31,107
I've talked with the others.

713
01:24:37,907 --> 01:24:41,159
We're never gonna have a better chance
to make it across the salt.

714
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:47,332
If we leave the Rig here, and load the
motorcycles up with as much as we can...

715
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:50,085
...we can maybe ride for 160 days.

716
01:24:52,797 --> 01:24:54,756
One of those bikes is yours.

717
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:57,133
Fully loaded.

718
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:02,430
You're more than welcome
to come with us.

719
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:08,395
I'll make my own way.

720
01:25:15,069 --> 01:25:17,153
You know, hope is a mistake.

721
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:27,330
If you can't fix what's broken, you'll, uh...

722
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:30,875
You'll go insane.

723
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:48,685
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

724
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:52,022
<i>Where are you?</i>

725
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,692
<i>Help us. You promised to help us.</i>

726
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,371
<i>Come on, Pa! Let's go.</i>

727
01:26:40,321 --> 01:26:41,404
All right.

728
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,908
This is your way home.

729
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:49,454
We go back?

730
01:26:49,914 --> 01:26:51,456
Mm.

731
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,500
- Back?
- Yeah.

732
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:55,460
I thought you weren't insane anymore.

733
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:56,920
What are they saying?

734
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:59,381
He wants to go back from where they came.

735
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:00,799
The Citadel.

736
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,218
What's there to find at the Citadel?

737
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,178
Green.

738
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:06,763
And water.

739
01:27:08,015 --> 01:27:11,893
There's a ridiculous amount of clear water.
And a lot of crops.

740
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,562
Got everything you need.
Long as you're not afraid of heights.

741
01:27:14,814 --> 01:27:15,939
Where does the water come from?

742
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:19,859
He pumps it up from deep in the earth.
Calls it Aqua Cola and claims it for himself.

743
01:27:20,111 --> 01:27:22,362
And because he owns it, he owns all of us.

744
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:23,780
I don't like him already.

745
01:27:24,031 --> 01:27:26,408
It'll take two weeks
to skirt the Wall of Mountains.

746
01:27:26,659 --> 01:27:27,575
No.

747
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:30,537
I suggest we go back the same way we came.

748
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:33,665
Through the canyon.

749
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:38,586
It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through.

750
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:42,465
So we take the War Rig and we charge it
right through the middle of them.

751
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:43,716
We can decouple the tanker...

752
01:27:43,968 --> 01:27:45,218
...at the pass.

753
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,095
Shut it off behind us.

754
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:48,471
Kaboom.

755
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:53,852
And how exactly do we take the Citadel?

756
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:56,187
Assuming we're still alive by then.

757
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:59,023
If we can block the pass, it'll be easy.

758
01:27:59,275 --> 01:28:03,027
All that's left are his War Pups
and War Boys too sick to fight.

759
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:05,488
And we'll be with Nux.

760
01:28:06,157 --> 01:28:07,365
He's a War Boy.

761
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:10,243
He'll be bringing us home.
Bringing back what's stolen, as he's meant to.

762
01:28:13,664 --> 01:28:14,831
Yeah.

763
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,375
It feels like hope.

764
01:28:18,586 --> 01:28:20,128
I like this plan.

765
01:28:20,713 --> 01:28:21,713
We can start again.

766
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:24,048
Just like the old days!

767
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:26,843
Look.

768
01:28:27,553 --> 01:28:29,262
It'll be a hard day.

769
01:28:29,722 --> 01:28:32,807
But I guarantee you
that a 160 days' ride that way...

770
01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:37,187
...there's nothing but salt.

771
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:42,525
At least that way, you know,
we might be able to...

772
01:28:44,028 --> 01:28:45,278
...together...

773
01:28:46,864 --> 01:28:48,948
...come across some kind of redemption.

774
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:21,105
War Rig!

775
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:23,316
That's the War Rig!

776
01:29:33,327 --> 01:29:34,536
That's them.

777
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:36,037
Why are they going back?

778
01:29:36,497 --> 01:29:38,164
Do they wish to surrender?

779
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,375
They are heading for the canyon.

780
01:29:42,253 --> 01:29:45,213
They're going back to the Citadel!

781
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:47,131
They know it's undefended!

782
01:29:47,383 --> 01:29:48,466
Bollocks!

783
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:50,969
Roll up!

784
01:30:01,272 --> 01:30:02,522
Go!

785
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:26,379
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

786
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:27,589
To who?

787
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,299
Anyone that's listening.

788
01:30:53,699 --> 01:30:54,657
Here we go, girls!

789
01:30:57,328 --> 01:30:58,578
That's mine!

790
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,917
He'll try to get in front of us.
Spike our wheels.

791
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:13,259
Don't blow my engine.

792
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:14,802
Gonna nudge him.

793
01:31:15,054 --> 01:31:16,137
Just a little.

794
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:32,070
You filth! You traitored him!

795
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:37,742
Yeah!

796
01:31:56,095 --> 01:31:56,803
Go.

797
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:00,390
Aah! Aah!

798
01:32:10,401 --> 01:32:11,526
Ha!

799
01:32:12,528 --> 01:32:13,194
Aah!

800
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:23,871
Gotta back off.

801
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:27,417
Engine one is gone.
Two's about to blow.

802
01:32:27,668 --> 01:32:28,251
Right.

803
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:30,086
Are you a Black Thumb?

804
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:31,379
Uh-huh.

805
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:32,880
All right. Engine one. Now.

806
01:32:33,132 --> 01:32:34,465
You and me. Fifth wheel.

807
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,008
We'll unhook the tanker.

808
01:32:48,647 --> 01:32:49,564
One man, one bullet.

809
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:09,167
- I cannot see.
- Maadi! Maadi!

810
01:33:09,418 --> 01:33:10,585
I can't see.

811
01:33:30,606 --> 01:33:31,397
Oh.

812
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:50,958
Hey!

813
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:52,710
Harpoons and plows!

814
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:54,337
They're hauling us back!

815
01:34:05,599 --> 01:34:07,809
Leave three bolts. Three.

816
01:35:26,346 --> 01:35:27,096
Hey, you! Aargh!

817
01:35:42,988 --> 01:35:44,280
Are you okay?

818
01:35:46,992 --> 01:35:48,618
I think she's hurt.

819
01:36:12,476 --> 01:36:13,267
Hey!

820
01:36:39,628 --> 01:36:40,211
No!

821
01:36:44,591 --> 01:36:45,549
No!

822
01:36:50,389 --> 01:36:51,722
<i>Hey.</i>

823
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:52,932
<i>Stay with me.</i>

824
01:36:53,517 --> 01:36:55,267
<i>- Stay with me.</i>
- Stay with me.

825
01:36:55,519 --> 01:36:56,894
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey! Are you there?

826
01:36:58,772 --> 01:36:59,730
You finish that! I'll finish her!

827
01:37:08,407 --> 01:37:09,073
Unh!

828
01:38:30,614 --> 01:38:31,238
Valhalla!

829
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,004
Aah!

830
01:38:52,969 --> 01:38:53,552
Ha!

831
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:13,155
Engine one's good.

832
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:15,449
For now.

833
01:40:03,665 --> 01:40:05,082
She's hurt! She's hurt...

834
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:06,375
...real bad!

835
01:40:27,814 --> 01:40:28,480
Aah!

836
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:37,424
You hear that?

837
01:41:38,426 --> 01:41:40,010
We're gonna see two airborne V8s.

838
01:41:41,554 --> 01:41:43,264
I'm gonna need you to drive.

839
01:41:45,475 --> 01:41:47,142
I'll get him out of our way.

840
01:42:54,169 --> 01:42:55,461
Rictus!

841
01:42:56,546 --> 01:42:57,379
Take me!

842
01:43:10,977 --> 01:43:11,727
Cheedo!

843
01:43:11,978 --> 01:43:13,520
- What are you doing?
- Good girl.

844
01:43:17,859 --> 01:43:18,984
- Come here.
- Aah!

845
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:22,571
Aah!

846
01:43:24,407 --> 01:43:25,282
Big Boy!

847
01:43:26,368 --> 01:43:28,035
Aah!

848
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:33,374
Here! Here!

849
01:43:51,643 --> 01:43:52,226
Unh!

850
01:44:27,262 --> 01:44:28,429
Remember me?

851
01:44:31,266 --> 01:44:32,099
Aah!

852
01:44:49,784 --> 01:44:50,826
He's dead!

853
01:44:51,661 --> 01:44:52,828
He's dead.

854
01:45:11,848 --> 01:45:14,808
When you're across safe,
I'll jam the throttle and follow you.

855
01:45:15,602 --> 01:45:16,643
Come on!

856
01:45:17,729 --> 01:45:20,272
Hurry! We're nearly at the pass.

857
01:46:07,904 --> 01:46:09,488
Witness me.

858
01:46:15,954 --> 01:46:16,954
Rictus!

859
01:47:12,552 --> 01:47:14,177
Why is she making that noise?

860
01:47:14,429 --> 01:47:16,138
She's pumping air into her chest cavity.

861
01:47:17,015 --> 01:47:18,557
She's collapsing her lungs...

862
01:47:18,808 --> 01:47:20,601
...one breath at a time.

863
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:27,524
I know.

864
01:47:30,486 --> 01:47:31,945
I am so sorry.

865
01:47:34,699 --> 01:47:35,949
I know. I know.

866
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,535
Hold it there.

867
01:47:39,412 --> 01:47:40,495
All right.

868
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:43,874
Put that on there. Press it in. Hey.

869
01:47:45,251 --> 01:47:45,917
Hey.

870
01:47:46,169 --> 01:47:47,294
Home.

871
01:47:54,594 --> 01:47:55,927
Home.

872
01:48:02,352 --> 01:48:04,394
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- She's exsanguinated.

873
01:48:04,646 --> 01:48:05,937
- Drained all her blood.
- Well...

874
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:08,607
Hold these.

875
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:10,025
We need that.

876
01:48:11,361 --> 01:48:12,527
Needle.

877
01:48:13,529 --> 01:48:14,404
Come on.

878
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:16,490
Take this.

879
01:48:19,661 --> 01:48:20,452
Keep her awake.

880
01:48:21,371 --> 01:48:22,621
Furiosa.

881
01:48:26,292 --> 01:48:28,460
Okay, that's not retracting.

882
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:30,337
There we go.

883
01:48:31,214 --> 01:48:33,131
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

884
01:48:34,717 --> 01:48:35,884
All right.

885
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:36,927
Sorry.

886
01:48:39,347 --> 01:48:41,807
There you go. Okay. There you go.

887
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:55,529
Max.

888
01:48:56,864 --> 01:48:58,365
My name is Max.

889
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:02,411
Yeah. Mm-hm.

890
01:49:02,745 --> 01:49:04,162
Mm.

891
01:49:07,125 --> 01:49:08,709
That's my name.

892
01:49:50,585 --> 01:49:51,251
Brake!

893
01:49:57,133 --> 01:49:58,258
Reveal yourself.

894
01:50:17,403 --> 01:50:18,695
He's got something.

895
01:50:25,995 --> 01:50:26,912
It's Immortan Joe.

896
01:50:27,663 --> 01:50:29,080
The Immortan Joe is dead!

897
01:50:56,275 --> 01:50:57,526
Furiosa!

898
01:50:57,819 --> 01:50:58,985
Furiosa!

899
01:50:59,237 --> 01:51:00,320
Furiosa!

900
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:01,696
Furiosa!

901
01:51:02,657 --> 01:51:03,865
Furiosa!

902
01:51:04,242 --> 01:51:05,659
She's back.

903
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:08,495
<i>Let them up! Let them up!</i>

904
01:51:08,746 --> 01:51:10,205
<i>Let them up!</i>

905
01:51:10,456 --> 01:51:12,499
<i>Let them up! Let them up!</i>

906
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:16,920
Come on, let's do it!

907
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:18,672
Let them up. Come on.

908
01:51:51,205 --> 01:51:52,497
Come on.

909
02:00:18,921 --> 02:00:20,922
