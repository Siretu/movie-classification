1
00:00:02,849 --> 00:00:07,249
DON CAMELLO
PRESENTS

2
00:00:07,972 --> 00:00:14,672
WITH ASSOCIATION OF
TAREK BADRA

3
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:23,525
AND KOL SALTANA WA
EL SULTAN 
BOASHA

4
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:14,138
-You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!

5
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:24,352
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

6
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:35,060
Go back to the Shadow.

7
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:39,766
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

8
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,134
You shall not pass!

9
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:16,966
No! No!

10
00:02:17,174 --> 00:02:19,142
Gandalf!

11
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,479
Fly, you fools.

12
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,984
No!

13
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:33,015
Gandalf!

14
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:40,525
Gandalf!

15
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,760
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

16
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:47,430
Nothing.

17
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,769
Just a dream.

18
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,152
Can you see the bottom?

19
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:14,555
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

20
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,535
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

21
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:30,615
Mr. Frodo!

22
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:34,947
I think I've found the bottom.

23
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:43,350
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

24
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:46,759
It's not natural. None of it.

25
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:51,927
-What's in this?
-Nothing.

26
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:54,363
Just a bit of seasoning.

27
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:57,771
I thought maybe if we were having
a roast chicken one night or something.

28
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,540
Roast chicken?!

29
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:02,408
You never know.

30
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:05,816
Sam. My dear Sam.

31
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,455
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

32
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:14,715
It is special.

33
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:20,496
It's a little bit of home.

34
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:25,236
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

35
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:29,196
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

36
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:33,876
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

37
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,514
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:39,817
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

39
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,953
Won't come free in a hurry.

40
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,957
Real Elves rope.

41
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:09,607
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

42
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:11,979
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

43
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,483
It's just where we can't get.

44
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:18,892
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

45
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:23,993
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

46
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:28,932
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam. . .

47
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,271
. . .but they did.

48
00:06:42,385 --> 00:06:43,317
Mr. Frodo?

49
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:48,656
It's the Ring, isn't it?

50
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,227
It's getting heavier.

51
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:07,604
-What food have we got left?
-Let me see.

52
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,403
Oh, yes. Lovely.

53
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,344
Lembas bread. And look!

54
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:18,049
More Lembas bread.

55
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:29,766
I don't usually hold with foreign food. . .

56
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:32,959
. . .but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

57
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:37,296
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

58
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,411
Those rain clouds might.

59
00:08:16,717 --> 00:08:19,481
This looks strangely familiar.

60
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:22,578
It's because we've been here before.

61
00:08:22,756 --> 00:08:25,316
We're going in circles.

62
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:27,924
What is that horrid stink?

63
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:30,290
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

64
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:32,398
-Can you smell it?
-Yes.

65
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:36,664
I can smell it.

66
00:08:39,907 --> 00:08:42,341
We're not alone.

67
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:59,085
The thieves. The thieves.

68
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,219
The filthy little thieves.

69
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:06,059
Where is it?

70
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:08,930
Where is it?

71
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:11,834
They stole it from us.

72
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:16,239
My precious.

73
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:20,377
Curse them, we hates them!

74
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:24,645
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

75
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,539
This is Sting.

76
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,234
You've seen it before. . .

77
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,913
. . . haven't you, Gollum?

78
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:30,477
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

79
00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:47,268
It burns!

80
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:49,771
It burns us!

81
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:52,711
It freezes!

82
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:56,778
Nasty Elves twisted it.

83
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,611
-Take it off us!
-Quiet, you!

84
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:07,288
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

85
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,054
-Let's just tie him up and leave him.
-No!

86
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:13,821
That would kill us! Kill us!

87
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,696
It's no more than you deserve!

88
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:19,429
Maybe he does deserve to die.

89
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:25,278
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

90
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:33,584
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

91
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:35,585
Take it off us.

92
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:42,629
We swears to do what you wants.

93
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:44,731
We swears.

94
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:47,467
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

95
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:51,900
We swears. . .

96
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:56,906
. . .to serve the master
of the precious.

97
00:11:57,546 --> 00:11:59,878
We will swear on. . .

98
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,017
. . .on the precious.

99
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:04,379
Gollum. Gollum.

100
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:08,683
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

101
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:10,856
Yes. . .

102
00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:13,918
. . .on the precious.

103
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:18,732
On the precious.

104
00:12:19,902 --> 00:12:21,392
I don't believe you!

105
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:26,897
-Get down! I said, down!
-Sam!

106
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:27,838
He's trying to trick us.

107
00:12:28,011 --> 00:12:31,003
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

108
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:44,953
-You know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.

109
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,629
You've been there before?

110
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,228
Yes.

111
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:05,776
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

112
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:18,227
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

113
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:23,198
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

114
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:27,600
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

115
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,242
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

116
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:37,404
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

117
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,450
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

118
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:44,750
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

119
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:51,527
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

120
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,163
There! What did I tell you?

121
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:57,566
He's run off, the old villain.

122
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:00,262
So much for his promises.

123
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:02,032
This way, Hobbits.

124
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,334
Follow me!

125
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:17,591
Merry!

126
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:20,051
Merry!

127
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:29,334
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

128
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:31,335
He wants the Shire-rats now.

129
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:36,804
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

130
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:40,907
Saruman will have his prize.

131
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,280
We will deliver them.

132
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:51,858
Merry!

133
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:54,358
Merry? Wake up.

134
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,698
My friend is sick.

135
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:01,798
He needs water. Please!

136
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:06,508
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

137
00:15:09,746 --> 00:15:11,407
Stop it!

138
00:15:13,617 --> 00:15:16,245
Can't take his draught!

139
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:21,482
-Leave him alone!
-Why?

140
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:24,391
You want some?

141
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:28,495
Then keep your mouth shut.

142
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,927
Merry.

143
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:35,328
Hello, Pip.

144
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:39,609
-You're hurt.
-I'm fine.

145
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:42,268
-It was just an act.
-An act?

146
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:45,814
See? I fooled you too.

147
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,248
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

148
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:53,548
What is it? What do you smell?

149
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:55,823
Man-flesh.

150
00:15:57,963 --> 00:16:00,329
They've picked up our trail.

151
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:02,559
Aragorn.

152
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,100
Let's move!

153
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:31,186
Their pace has quickened.

154
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,166
They must have caught our scent.

155
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:35,097
Hurry!

156
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:40,502
Come on, Gimli!

157
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:46,643
Three days and nights pursuit.

158
00:16:46,814 --> 00:16:49,783
No food. No rest.

159
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,943
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

160
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:25,549
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

161
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,256
They may yet be alive.

162
00:17:30,094 --> 00:17:32,722
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

163
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:37,823
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

164
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:42,301
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

165
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,105
Very dangerous over short distances.

166
00:17:57,855 --> 00:17:59,584
Rohan.

167
00:17:59,756 --> 00:18:02,554
Home of the Horse-lords.

168
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,320
There's something strange at work here.

169
00:18:05,497 --> 00:18:08,466
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

170
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:11,602
Sets its will against us.

171
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:19,675
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

172
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:22,404
The Uruks turn northeast.

173
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:25,409
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

174
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:26,546
Saruman.

175
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,157
The world is changing.

176
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,927
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard. . .

177
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:47,367
. . . and Mordor?

178
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:54,706
To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman. . .

179
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,509
. . . and the union of the two towers?

180
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:07,993
Together, my Lord Sauron. . .

181
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,687
. . . we shall rule this Middle-earth.

182
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,046
The Old World will burn
In the fires of Industry.

183
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:32,883
The forests will fall.

184
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,657
A new order will rise.

185
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:43,630
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear. . .

186
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:45,758
. . . and the Iron fists of the Orc.

187
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:01,513
I want them armed and ready to march
within two weeks!

188
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:03,312
But, my lord, there are too many!

189
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:06,513
They cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

190
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,750
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

191
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:12,760
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

192
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:18,397
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

193
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:22,169
-Burn it.
-Yes.

194
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:25,204
We will fight for you.

195
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:27,344
Swear it.

196
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:42,622
We will die for Saruman.

197
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:45,718
The Horse-Men took your lands.

198
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:50,424
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

199
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:51,034
Murderers!

200
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,063
Take back the lands they stole from you.

201
00:20:54,272 --> 00:20:56,035
Burn every village!

202
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:04,408
We have only to remove those
who oppose us.

203
00:21:04,883 --> 00:21:07,408
It will begin In Rohan.

204
00:21:08,153 --> 00:21:11,680
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

205
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:13,653
But no more.

206
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:16,089
Éothain! Éothain!

207
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:20,925
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

208
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,961
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

209
00:21:24,135 --> 00:21:25,796
He is too big for him.

210
00:21:25,004 --> 00:21:27,973
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

211
00:21:28,174 --> 00:21:30,665
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, Mama.

212
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:33,877
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

213
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:37,777
Freda, I will find you there.

214
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,383
Quickly!

215
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:50,354
Go, child.

216
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:05,144
Rohan, my lord. . .

217
00:22:05,613 --> 00:22:08,343
. . .is ready to fall.

218
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:21,118
Théodred.

219
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:22,956
Find the king's son!

220
00:22:37,414 --> 00:22:43,444
-Mordor will pay for this.
-These Orcs are not from Mordor.

221
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:47,187
My Lord Éomer, over here!

222
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,796
He's alive.

223
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:28,691
Théodred.

224
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,106
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

225
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:48,008
He was ambushed by Orcs.

226
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:53,183
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

227
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:56,049
That is a lie.

228
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:03,064
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

229
00:24:02,736 --> 00:24:04,727
Gríma.

230
00:24:06,173 --> 00:24:08,107
Gríma.

231
00:24:10,644 --> 00:24:12,134
Gríma.

232
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:16,006
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

233
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:20,011
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

234
00:24:20,687 --> 00:24:23,588
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

235
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:37,199
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

236
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:39,872
Can you not see?

237
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,068
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent. . .

238
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,804
. . .your warmongering.

239
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:50,985
Warmongering?

240
00:24:51,152 --> 00:24:53,313
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

241
00:24:54,155 --> 00:24:56,521
What was the promised price, Gríma?

242
00:24:56,758 --> 00:25:00,353
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

243
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,468
Too long have you watched my sister.

244
00:25:14,677 --> 00:25:16,645
Too long have you haunted her steps.

245
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,054
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

246
00:25:29,224 --> 00:25:30,384
Too much.

247
00:25:31,728 --> 00:25:36,529
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan. . .

248
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,501
. . .and all its domains
under pain of death.

249
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:44,304
You have no authority here.

250
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:46,942
Your orders mean nothing.

251
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:51,311
This order does not come from me.

252
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:52,642
It comes from the king.

253
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,844
He signed it this morning.

254
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,114
Keep breathing. That's the key.

255
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:30,049
Breathe.

256
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,994
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

257
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:55,172
We're not going no further. . .

258
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:57,340
. . . until we've had a breather.

259
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:59,853
Get a fire going!

260
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:05,482
Merry!

261
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,190
Merry!

262
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:14,095
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

263
00:27:23,577 --> 00:27:25,772
What's making that noise?

264
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:28,814
It's the trees.

265
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,608
What?

266
00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:34,785
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

267
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:39,449
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall. . .

268
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:41,150
. . .and come alive.

269
00:27:40,395 --> 00:27:42,090
Alive?

270
00:27:42,964 --> 00:27:44,659
Trees that could whisper. . .

271
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:48,135
. . .talk to each other. . .

272
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:50,100
. . .even move.

273
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,970
I'm starving.

274
00:27:53,142 --> 00:27:57,203
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

275
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,842
Yeah!

276
00:27:59,048 --> 00:28:02,313
Why can't we have some meat?!

277
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:05,882
What about them?

278
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:07,956
They're fresh.

279
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:12,391
They are not for eating.

280
00:28:18,368 --> 00:28:20,336
What about their legs?

281
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:22,835
They don't need those.

282
00:28:23,307 --> 00:28:26,504
-They look tasty.
-Get back, scum!

283
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:33,215
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

284
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:35,518
Alive?

285
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:42,755
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

286
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:48,530
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

287
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:51,725
The master wants it for the war.

288
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:56,504
They think we have the Ring.

289
00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:59,108
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

290
00:28:59,978 --> 00:29:01,946
Just a mouthful. . .

291
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:03,308
. . .a bit of the flank.

292
00:29:10,122 --> 00:29:13,683
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

293
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:21,561
Pippin.

294
00:29:21,733 --> 00:29:23,428
Let's go.

295
00:29:31,877 --> 00:29:33,367
Go on.

296
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:35,046
Call for help.

297
00:29:35,448 --> 00:29:36,540
Squeal.

298
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:39,912
No one's going to save you now.

299
00:29:49,095 --> 00:29:50,494
Pippin!

300
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:15,278
A red sun rises.

301
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,725
Blood has been spilled this night.

302
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,756
Riders of Rohan. . .

303
00:30:51,193 --> 00:30:53,627
. . .what news from the Mark?

304
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,793
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

305
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:25,857
Speak quickly!

306
00:31:26,197 --> 00:31:30,861
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

307
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:41,536
I would cut off your head, Dwarf. . .

308
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:44,347
. . .if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

309
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:47,443
You would die before your stroke fell.

310
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:58,061
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

311
00:31:58,397 --> 00:32:02,595
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

312
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:05,999
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

313
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,506
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

314
00:32:11,744 --> 00:32:13,939
Not even his own kin.

315
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,418
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king. . .

316
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:20,520
. . .and claimed lordship over these lands.

317
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,482
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

318
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:27,422
And for that, we are banished.

319
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:32,796
The White Wizard is cunning.

320
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:35,867
He walks here and there, they say. . .

321
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,004
. . .as an old man hooded and cloaked.

322
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,706
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

323
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,108
We are no spies.

324
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,215
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

325
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:51,849
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

326
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:55,121
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

327
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:58,452
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

328
00:32:57,626 --> 00:33:00,595
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

329
00:33:03,932 --> 00:33:05,923
We left none alive.

330
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,537
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

331
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,238
Dead?

332
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:19,942
I am sorry.

333
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:27,819
Hasufel! Arod!

334
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:34,289
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

335
00:33:35,498 --> 00:33:37,090
Farewell.

336
00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:43,535
Look for your friends.

337
00:33:44,007 --> 00:33:46,237
But do not trust to hope.

338
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:50,505
It has forsaken these lands.

339
00:33:50,714 --> 00:33:52,705
We ride north!

340
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,131
It's one of their wee belts.

341
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,974
We failed them.

342
00:35:11,032 --> 00:35:13,193
A Hobbit lay here.

343
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:16,729
And the other.

344
00:35:26,548 --> 00:35:28,140
They crawled.

345
00:35:32,254 --> 00:35:34,347
Their hands were bound.

346
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:48,332
Their bonds were cut.

347
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:05,946
They ran over here.

348
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:09,785
They were followed.

349
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:14,725
The belt!

350
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,761
Run!

351
00:36:22,506 --> 00:36:23,837
Tracks lead away from the battle. . .

352
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:30,739
. . .into Fangorn Forest.

353
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:33,082
Fangorn?

354
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,878
What madness drove them in there?

355
00:36:51,637 --> 00:36:54,629
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

356
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:04,783
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

357
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:12,012
Come here!

358
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,090
Trees. Climb a tree.

359
00:37:28,408 --> 00:37:30,137
He's gone.

360
00:37:42,222 --> 00:37:44,554
Merry!

361
00:37:56,036 --> 00:38:00,439
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

362
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:07,105
Run, Merry!

363
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:21,226
Little Orcs.

364
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:23,729
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

365
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:25,799
Tree?

366
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:28,960
I am no tree!

367
00:38:29,204 --> 00:38:31,365
I am an Ent.

368
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,067
A tree-herder.

369
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:36,611
A shepherd of the forest.

370
00:38:36,779 --> 00:38:38,144
Don't talk to it, Merry.

371
00:38:38,647 --> 00:38:40,114
Don't encourage it!

372
00:38:40,315 --> 00:38:44,547
Treebeard, some call me.

373
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,688
And whose side are you on?

374
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:48,916
Side?

375
00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:50,991
I am on nobody's side. . .

376
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:56,697
. . .because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

377
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,130
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

378
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,939
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

379
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:07,406
Hobbits?

380
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:12,514
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

381
00:39:13,717 --> 00:39:18,211
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

382
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,516
They come with fire.

383
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:23,284
They come with axes.

384
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:28,295
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

385
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:32,299
-Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
-No!

386
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,369
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

387
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:36,370
Halflings!

388
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:37,633
Shire-folk!

389
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:40,175
Maybe you are. . .

390
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:44,108
. . .and maybe you aren't.

391
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:49,119
The White Wizard will know.

392
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,855
The White Wizard?

393
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:53,881
Saruman.

394
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,133
See? See?

395
00:40:08,374 --> 00:40:10,774
We've led you out.

396
00:40:10,943 --> 00:40:13,434
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

397
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:19,017
Very lucky we find you.

398
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:26,420
Nice Hobbit.

399
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:32,594
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

400
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:35,394
A swamp, yes, yes.

401
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:39,868
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

402
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,646
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

403
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:51,545
I found it. I did.

404
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:54,415
The way through the marshes.

405
00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:58,114
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

406
00:40:58,326 --> 00:41:02,387
They go around for miles and miles.

407
00:41:02,597 --> 00:41:04,030
Come quickly.

408
00:41:04,232 --> 00:41:08,293
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

409
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,803
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

410
00:41:11,974 --> 00:41:14,238
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

411
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:17,777
No, no birdses to eat.

412
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:22,245
No crunchable birdses.

413
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:25,718
We are famished! Yes!

414
00:41:25,888 --> 00:41:30,188
Famished we are, precious!

415
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,664
Here.

416
00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:47,867
What does it eats?

417
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,047
Is it tasty?

418
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:57,947
It tries to chokes us!

419
00:41:58,222 --> 00:42:01,885
We can't eats Hobbit food!

420
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:07,621
We must starve!

421
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:09,164
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

422
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:12,130
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

423
00:42:12,337 --> 00:42:15,170
It does not care if we be hungry.

424
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:20,140
Does not care if we should die.

425
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:23,612
Not like master.

426
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:27,076
Master cares.

427
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:30,118
Master knows.

428
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,559
Yes.

429
00:42:33,726 --> 00:42:36,354
Precious.

430
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,561
Once it takes hold of us. . .

431
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:49,602
. . .it never lets go.

432
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:51,469
Don't touch me!

433
00:43:21,943 --> 00:43:23,808
There are dead things!

434
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:25,741
Dead faces in the water.

435
00:43:30,585 --> 00:43:34,544
All dead. All rotten.

436
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:38,822
Elves and Men and Orcses.

437
00:43:39,027 --> 00:43:42,656
A great battle long ago.

438
00:43:43,465 --> 00:43:45,194
Dead Marshes.

439
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,130
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

440
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,567
This way.

441
00:43:50,773 --> 00:43:53,537
Don't follow the lights.

442
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:59,145
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones. . .

443
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:03,444
. . .and light little candles
of their own.

444
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:29,112
Frodo!

445
00:45:12,591 --> 00:45:17,255
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights.

446
00:45:17,429 --> 00:45:19,294
-Gollum!
-Mr. Frodo!

447
00:45:19,464 --> 00:45:21,329
Are you all right?

448
00:45:48,229 --> 00:45:51,198
So bright.

449
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:55,198
So beautiful.

450
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:59,237
Our precious.

451
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:02,198
What did you say?

452
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:04,570
Master should be resting.

453
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:08,806
Master needs to keep up his strength.

454
00:46:10,784 --> 00:46:14,049
-Who are you?
-Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

455
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:15,711
Gollum. Gollum.

456
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:17,687
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

457
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:20,954
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

458
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:22,687
He said your life was a sad story.

459
00:46:22,898 --> 00:46:27,426
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has falled and moon is dead

460
00:46:27,602 --> 00:46:30,594
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

461
00:46:30,805 --> 00:46:32,534
Were you?

462
00:46:33,776 --> 00:46:36,006
Sméagol.

463
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:43,241
What did you call me?

464
00:46:44,587 --> 00:46:47,351
That was your name once, wasn't it?

465
00:46:47,924 --> 00:46:50,290
A long time ago.

466
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:51,288
My name.

467
00:46:52,363 --> 00:46:53,853
My name.

468
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:03,206
Sméagol.

469
00:47:07,345 --> 00:47:08,972
Black Riders!

470
00:47:09,147 --> 00:47:10,478
Hide! Hide!

471
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:22,357
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

472
00:47:22,528 --> 00:47:26,157
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

473
00:47:26,932 --> 00:47:29,594
-I thought they were dead.
-Dead?

474
00:47:29,768 --> 00:47:32,737
No, you cannot kill them. No.

475
00:47:58,898 --> 00:47:59,990
Wraiths!

476
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,395
Wraiths on wings!

477
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,435
They are calling for it.

478
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,206
They are calling for the precious.

479
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:19,478
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

480
00:48:19,653 --> 00:48:20,915
I'm here.

481
00:48:35,937 --> 00:48:37,461
Hurry, Hobbits.

482
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,976
The Black Gate is very close.

483
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,715
Orc blood.

484
00:49:00,662 --> 00:49:02,425
These are strange tracks.

485
00:49:03,698 --> 00:49:05,723
The air is so close in here.

486
00:49:06,868 --> 00:49:09,302
This forest is old.

487
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:12,096
Very old.

488
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:16,173
Full of memory. . .

489
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,112
. . .and anger.

490
00:49:26,289 --> 00:49:29,190
The trees are speaking to each other.

491
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:30,848
Gimli!

492
00:49:31,027 --> 00:49:32,961
Lower your ax.

493
00:49:34,765 --> 00:49:37,529
They have feelings, my friend.

494
00:49:38,068 --> 00:49:40,059
The Elves began it.

495
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:45,003
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

496
00:49:45,509 --> 00:49:47,875
Talking trees.

497
00:49:48,512 --> 00:49:51,538
What do trees have to talk about?

498
00:49:51,715 --> 00:49:54,878
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

499
00:50:07,832 --> 00:50:10,266
The White Wizard approaches.

500
00:50:16,474 --> 00:50:20,774
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

501
00:50:30,355 --> 00:50:32,619
We must be quick.

502
00:50:48,206 --> 00:50:51,835
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

503
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:51,809
Where are they?

504
00:50:51,978 --> 00:50:55,539
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

505
00:50:55,715 --> 00:50:59,981
They met someone they did not expect.

506
00:51:00,153 --> 00:51:02,280
Does that comfort you?

507
00:51:02,455 --> 00:51:04,423
Who are you?

508
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:07,860
Show yourself!

509
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:18,761
It cannot be.

510
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:22,708
Forgive me.

511
00:51:24,377 --> 00:51:26,311
I mistook you for Saruman.

512
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,844
I am Saruman.

513
00:51:31,384 --> 00:51:35,252
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

514
00:51:34,223 --> 00:51:35,713
You fell.

515
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:39,717
Through fire. . .

516
00:51:39,895 --> 00:51:41,192
. . .and water.

517
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:45,189
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak. . .

518
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:49,064
. . . I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.

519
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,650
Until at last I threw down
my enemy. . .

520
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:10,283
. . . and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.

521
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,860
Darkness took me. . .

522
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:23,698
. . . and I strayed out of thought
and time.

523
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,535
Stars wheeled overhead. . .

524
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:32,305
. . . and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

525
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,578
But It was not the end.

526
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,653
I felt life In me again.

527
00:52:39,592 --> 00:52:42,117
I've been sent back. . .

528
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:43,853
. . . until my task is done.

529
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,130
Gandalf.

530
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:48,790
Gandalf?

531
00:52:49,201 --> 00:52:50,998
Yes.

532
00:52:53,806 --> 00:52:55,603
That was what they used to call me.

533
00:52:58,477 --> 00:53:00,741
Gandalf the Grey.

534
00:53:02,081 --> 00:53:03,844
That was my name.

535
00:53:04,016 --> 00:53:05,449
Gandalf.

536
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,479
I am Gandalf the White.

537
00:53:12,525 --> 00:53:15,585
And I come back to you now. . .

538
00:53:15,761 --> 00:53:18,252
. . .at the turn of the tide.

539
00:53:19,365 --> 00:53:22,334
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

540
00:53:23,102 --> 00:53:26,265
-We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
-Edoras?

541
00:53:27,206 --> 00:53:29,231
That is no short distance!

542
00:53:29,508 --> 00:53:32,739
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes I'll with the king.

543
00:53:32,912 --> 00:53:35,005
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

544
00:53:35,181 --> 00:53:38,617
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

545
00:53:38,784 --> 00:53:40,775
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here. . .

546
00:53:40,953 --> 00:53:45,117
. . .in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested--?

547
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:49,890
I mean, charming. . .

548
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:52,793
. . .quite charming forest.

549
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:56,996
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

550
00:53:57,204 --> 00:54:01,573
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

551
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:04,178
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones. . .

552
00:54:04,345 --> 00:54:07,678
. . .that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

553
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:10,841
I n one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

554
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:14,613
You still speak in riddles.

555
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:23,863
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

556
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:27,660
The Ents are going to wake up. . .

557
00:54:28,202 --> 00:54:32,696
-. . .and find that they are strong.
-Strong?!

558
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:34,634
Oh, that's good.

559
00:54:33,842 --> 00:54:36,538
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

560
00:54:37,646 --> 00:54:39,876
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

561
00:54:40,048 --> 00:54:43,643
I n fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

562
00:54:43,819 --> 00:54:47,550
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

563
00:55:08,845 --> 00:55:10,278
That is one of the Mearas. . .

564
00:55:10,447 --> 00:55:13,245
. . . unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

565
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:32,131
Shadowfax.

566
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,333
He is the lord of all horses. . .

567
00:55:37,976 --> 00:55:41,844
. . .and has been my friend
through many dangers.

568
00:55:56,094 --> 00:55:59,689
O rowan mine

569
00:55:59,865 --> 00:56:03,665
I saw you shine

570
00:56:02,835 --> 00:56:06,362
Upon a summer's day

571
00:56:07,473 --> 00:56:11,933
Upon your head
How golden-red

572
00:56:12,144 --> 00:56:16,877
The crown you bore aloft

573
00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:19,449
Such a beautiful verse.

574
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:24,522
-Is it much further?
-Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

575
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,955
You might call it far, perhaps.

576
00:56:27,861 --> 00:56:31,661
My home lies deep in the forest. . .

577
00:56:31,865 --> 00:56:35,767
. . . near the roots of the mountain.

578
00:56:37,037 --> 00:56:40,700
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

579
00:56:40,941 --> 00:56:44,900
And safe is where I'll keep you.

580
00:56:45,178 --> 00:56:49,547
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

581
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:52,942
It's one of my own compositions.

582
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,314
Right.

583
00:56:54,488 --> 00:57:00,620
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

584
00:57:00,794 --> 00:57:05,663
And the dreams of trees unfold

585
00:57:04,832 --> 00:57:11,294
When woodland halls are green and cool

586
00:57:11,506 --> 00:57:15,567
And the wind is In the West

587
00:57:15,044 --> 00:57:17,706
Come back to me

588
00:57:18,247 --> 00:57:22,707
Come back to me

589
00:57:22,885 --> 00:57:29,313
And say my land is best

590
00:57:35,765 --> 00:57:39,428
Sleep, little Shirelings.

591
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:43,198
Heed no nightly noise.

592
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:47,308
Sleep till morning light.

593
00:57:48,945 --> 00:57:53,109
I have business in the forest.

594
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:58,812
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

595
00:57:59,056 --> 00:58:03,720
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

596
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:09,730
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

597
00:58:18,176 --> 00:58:22,442
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

598
00:58:23,248 --> 00:58:25,842
Sauron will suffer no rival.

599
00:58:26,284 --> 00:58:30,550
From the summit of Barad-dûr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

600
00:58:30,722 --> 00:58:34,089
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

601
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:37,095
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

602
00:58:37,262 --> 00:58:39,822
The rumor has reached him.

603
00:58:39,998 --> 00:58:42,967
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.

604
00:58:43,935 --> 00:58:46,768
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

605
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:49,267
He fears what you may become.

606
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:53,979
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

607
00:58:54,147 --> 00:58:57,776
He will use his puppet Saruman
to destroy Rohan.

608
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,440
War is coming.

609
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:03,180
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge. . .

610
00:59:03,356 --> 00:59:05,790
. . .for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

611
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:09,655
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

612
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:12,923
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

613
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:17,798
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

614
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,765
But for all their cunning. . .

615
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,498
. . .we have one advantage.

616
00:59:24,678 --> 00:59:27,238
The Ring remains hidden.

617
00:59:27,282 --> 00:59:29,182
And that we should seek to destroy it. . .

618
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:32,319
. . . has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

619
00:59:32,921 --> 00:59:36,220
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor. . .

620
00:59:36,391 --> 00:59:37,881
. . .in the hands of a Hobbit.

621
00:59:38,059 --> 00:59:42,155
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

622
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,958
We must trust now in Frodo.

623
00:59:45,133 --> 00:59:46,964
Everything depends upon speed. . .

624
00:59:46,135 --> 00:59:49,127
. . .and the secrecy of his quest.

625
00:59:51,107 --> 00:59:54,440
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

626
00:59:55,311 --> 00:59:58,075
Frodo must finish this task alone.

627
00:59:58,814 --> 01:00:01,146
He's not alone.

628
01:00:01,317 --> 01:00:03,012
Sam went with him.

629
01:00:03,686 --> 01:00:04,880
Did he?

630
01:00:05,054 --> 01:00:09,684
Did he, indeed? Good.

631
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:12,726
Yes, very good.

632
01:00:19,736 --> 01:00:24,639
The Black Gate of Mordor.

633
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:29,845
Oh, save us.

634
01:00:35,652 --> 01:00:38,883
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

635
01:00:41,124 --> 01:00:45,584
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

636
01:00:45,762 --> 01:00:49,198
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

637
01:00:48,366 --> 01:00:49,594
I did.

638
01:00:58,376 --> 01:01:00,367
That's it, then.

639
01:01:01,946 --> 01:01:03,243
We can't get past that.

640
01:01:45,426 --> 01:01:46,757
Look!

641
01:01:46,927 --> 01:01:48,394
The gate.

642
01:01:48,562 --> 01:01:49,756
It's opening!

643
01:01:56,204 --> 01:01:58,172
I can see a way down.

644
01:01:58,907 --> 01:02:01,000
Sam, no!

645
01:02:03,211 --> 01:02:04,576
Master!

646
01:03:26,363 --> 01:03:29,890
-I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
-I know, Mr. Frodo.

647
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:33,830
I doubt even these Elves cloaks
will hide us in there.

648
01:03:32,271 --> 01:03:34,136
-Now!
-No!

649
01:03:34,707 --> 01:03:36,675
No! No, master!

650
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:39,844
They catch you! They catch you!

651
01:03:41,146 --> 01:03:43,706
Don't take it to him.

652
01:03:46,652 --> 01:03:49,382
He wants the precious.

653
01:03:49,555 --> 01:03:52,581
Always he is looking for it.

654
01:03:52,758 --> 01:03:56,660
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

655
01:03:56,895 --> 01:04:00,797
But we mustn't let him have it.

656
01:04:05,206 --> 01:04:07,299
No! There's another way.

657
01:04:07,508 --> 01:04:10,170
More secret. A dark way.

658
01:04:10,478 --> 01:04:14,141
-Why haven't you spoken of this before?
-Because master did not ask.

659
01:04:14,615 --> 01:04:15,639
He's up to something.

660
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:18,844
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

661
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,750
Yes. There's a path. . .

662
01:04:21,922 --> 01:04:24,413
. . .and some stairs.

663
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:26,286
And then. . .

664
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,793
. . .a tunnel.

665
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:44,608
He's led us this far, Sam.

666
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,179
Mr. Frodo, no.

667
01:04:47,315 --> 01:04:48,782
He's been true to his word.

668
01:04:53,655 --> 01:04:54,849
No.

669
01:04:56,992 --> 01:04:58,619
Lead the way, Sméagol.

670
01:04:59,227 --> 01:05:03,163
Good Sméagol always helps.

671
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:36,121
Hello?

672
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:40,594
Treebeard?

673
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:42,636
Where has he gone?

674
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,274
I had the loveliest dream last night.

675
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:48,605
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

676
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:51,270
And we smoked all of it.
And then. . .

677
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,716
. . .you were sick.

678
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:58,152
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

679
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:03,592
Did you hear that?

680
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:10,066
There it is again.

681
01:06:12,003 --> 01:06:16,599
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

682
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:23,346
You just said something. . .Treeish.

683
01:06:22,515 --> 01:06:26,508
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

684
01:06:34,059 --> 01:06:35,924
You're taller.

685
01:06:36,462 --> 01:06:37,952
-Who?
-You!

686
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:39,757
-Than what?
-Than me!

687
01:06:40,266 --> 01:06:42,393
I've always been taller than you.

688
01:06:41,568 --> 01:06:46,198
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

689
01:06:47,073 --> 01:06:48,563
Please, Merry.

690
01:06:48,775 --> 01:06:52,609
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

691
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:56,013
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7''.

692
01:06:58,151 --> 01:07:00,415
3'8''!

693
01:07:02,355 --> 01:07:04,186
Three-foot-eight.

694
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,160
You did something.

695
01:07:13,968 --> 01:07:15,560
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

696
01:07:16,504 --> 01:07:17,971
Merry!

697
01:07:18,172 --> 01:07:20,504
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

698
01:07:20,675 --> 01:07:24,577
-I want some!
-It could well be dangerous!

699
01:07:24,745 --> 01:07:26,906
Give me it back. Merry!

700
01:07:28,749 --> 01:07:30,114
What's happening?!

701
01:07:29,985 --> 01:07:31,452
It's got my leg!

702
01:07:31,787 --> 01:07:33,277
Merry!

703
01:07:52,674 --> 01:07:54,266
Help!

704
01:08:00,049 --> 01:08:01,914
Away with you.

705
01:08:02,085 --> 01:08:03,882
You should not be waking.

706
01:08:04,387 --> 01:08:09,256
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

707
01:08:09,859 --> 01:08:12,419
Go to sleep.

708
01:08:12,762 --> 01:08:14,627
Away with you.

709
01:08:14,797 --> 01:08:18,096
Come, the forest is waking up.

710
01:08:18,668 --> 01:08:20,602
It isn't safe.

711
01:08:23,273 --> 01:08:27,209
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

712
01:08:26,377 --> 01:08:29,369
Anger festers in their hearts.

713
01:08:30,247 --> 01:08:31,874
Black are their thoughts.

714
01:08:32,049 --> 01:08:34,574
Strong is their hate.

715
01:08:34,752 --> 01:08:37,516
They will harm you if they can.

716
01:08:37,688 --> 01:08:41,249
There are too few of us now.

717
01:08:40,425 --> 01:08:44,418
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

718
01:08:45,063 --> 01:08:47,691
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

719
01:08:47,866 --> 01:08:51,063
-Are there Ent children?
-Bru-ra-hroom.

720
01:08:51,236 --> 01:08:56,868
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

721
01:08:57,075 --> 01:09:02,308
-Why is that?
-We lost the Entwives.

722
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:03,979
Oh, I'm sorry.

723
01:09:04,082 --> 01:09:08,018
-How did they die?
-Die? No.

724
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:11,417
We lost them.

725
01:09:10,589 --> 01:09:15,652
And now we cannot find them.

726
01:09:15,828 --> 01:09:22,063
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

727
01:09:22,234 --> 01:09:24,794
Can't say that I have.

728
01:09:25,338 --> 01:09:27,363
You, Pip?

729
01:09:28,841 --> 01:09:31,241
What do they look like?

730
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:38,343
I don't remember now.

731
01:09:53,767 --> 01:09:57,669
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

732
01:09:57,438 --> 01:10:00,066
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan. . .

733
01:10:00,775 --> 01:10:03,642
. . . whose mind is overthrown.

734
01:10:03,811 --> 01:10:08,077
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

735
01:10:08,716 --> 01:10:11,879
My lord, your son. . .

736
01:10:12,053 --> 01:10:14,248
. . . he is dead.

737
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:17,554
My lord?

738
01:10:18,826 --> 01:10:19,986
Uncle?

739
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:28,065
Will you not go to him?

740
01:10:31,206 --> 01:10:33,606
Will you do nothing?

741
01:10:33,776 --> 01:10:35,744
Be careful what you say.

742
01:10:35,978 --> 01:10:38,105
Do not look for welcome here.

743
01:11:01,171 --> 01:11:05,301
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

744
01:11:05,508 --> 01:11:07,635
What a tragedy for the king. . .

745
01:11:07,877 --> 01:11:10,846
. . .to lose his only son and heir.

746
01:11:10,948 --> 01:11:15,476
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

747
01:11:15,653 --> 01:11:20,556
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

748
01:11:20,724 --> 01:11:22,191
Leave me alone, snake!

749
01:11:22,661 --> 01:11:24,288
Oh, but you are alone.

750
01:11:25,931 --> 01:11:30,698
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness. . .

751
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:34,327
. . .in the bitter watches of the night. . .

752
01:11:34,506 --> 01:11:38,169
. . .when all your life seems to shrink.

753
01:11:38,376 --> 01:11:42,574
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

754
01:11:42,747 --> 01:11:47,309
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

755
01:11:49,554 --> 01:11:51,454
So fair.

756
01:11:52,724 --> 01:11:54,089
So cold.

757
01:11:54,861 --> 01:11:57,022
Like a morning of pale spring. . .

758
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:00,666
. . .still clinging to winter's chill.

759
01:12:14,447 --> 01:12:16,938
Your words are poison.

760
01:13:46,508 --> 01:13:48,976
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

761
01:14:00,325 --> 01:14:04,125
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

762
01:14:05,631 --> 01:14:08,191
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.

763
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:27,313
Your staff.

764
01:14:30,722 --> 01:14:34,214
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

765
01:14:52,011 --> 01:14:54,878
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

766
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:04,747
He's a herald of woe.

767
01:15:04,924 --> 01:15:09,361
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late. . .

768
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,896
. . .Théoden King.

769
01:15:12,598 --> 01:15:15,123
He's not welcome.

770
01:15:15,069 --> 01:15:20,405
Why should I welcome you. . .

771
01:15:20,908 --> 01:15:24,571
. . .Gandalf Stormcrow?

772
01:15:24,745 --> 01:15:28,044
A just question, my liege.

773
01:15:26,215 --> 01:15:29,082
Late is the hour. . .

774
01:15:29,251 --> 01:15:33,210
. . .in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

775
01:15:34,023 --> 01:15:36,082
Láthspell I name him.

776
01:15:36,258 --> 01:15:39,159
I'll news is an I'll guest.

777
01:15:39,328 --> 01:15:43,890
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

778
01:15:44,066 --> 01:15:46,000
I have not passed
through fire and death. . .

779
01:15:46,102 --> 01:15:49,333
. . .to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

780
01:15:50,339 --> 01:15:52,432
His staff.

781
01:15:52,641 --> 01:15:56,771
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

782
01:16:00,116 --> 01:16:02,050
Théoden. . .

783
01:16:02,618 --> 01:16:05,178
. . .son of Théngel. . .

784
01:16:05,956 --> 01:16:08,322
. . .too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

785
01:16:11,294 --> 01:16:14,559
I would stay still if I were you.

786
01:16:14,731 --> 01:16:16,824
Hearken to me!

787
01:16:22,339 --> 01:16:24,466
I release you. . .

788
01:16:24,674 --> 01:16:26,642
. . .from the spell.

789
01:16:37,188 --> 01:16:40,214
You have no power here. . .

790
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:44,020
. . .Gandalf the Grey.

791
01:16:48,433 --> 01:16:53,496
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

792
01:17:01,948 --> 01:17:03,472
Wait.

793
01:17:04,918 --> 01:17:08,752
If I go, Théoden dies.

794
01:17:09,455 --> 01:17:11,650
You did not kill me. . .

795
01:17:11,825 --> 01:17:14,020
. . .you will not kill him.

796
01:17:17,931 --> 01:17:19,626
Rohan is mine.

797
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,431
Be gone.

798
01:18:03,946 --> 01:18:06,073
I know your face.

799
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:11,915
Éowyn.

800
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:15,485
Éowyn.

801
01:18:23,766 --> 01:18:24,960
Gandalf?

802
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:28,368
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

803
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,311
Dark have been my dreams of late.

804
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:52,223
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better. . .

805
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:55,364
. . .if they grasped your sword.

806
01:19:38,476 --> 01:19:40,444
I've only. . .

807
01:19:40,645 --> 01:19:43,705
. . .ever served you, my lord.

808
01:19:43,881 --> 01:19:48,875
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

809
01:19:48,887 --> 01:19:50,821
Send me not from your sight.

810
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:55,855
No, my lord! No, my lord.

811
01:19:56,061 --> 01:19:57,255
Let him go.

812
01:19:57,963 --> 01:20:01,194
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

813
01:20:09,342 --> 01:20:11,674
Get out of my way!

814
01:20:13,913 --> 01:20:17,076
Hail, Théoden King!

815
01:20:40,674 --> 01:20:43,165
Where is Théodred?

816
01:20:46,213 --> 01:20:48,773
Where is my son?

817
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:13,699
Simbelmynë.

818
01:22:18,877 --> 01:22:22,472
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

819
01:22:25,317 --> 01:22:28,286
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

820
01:22:30,356 --> 01:22:34,224
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

821
01:22:34,994 --> 01:22:39,397
The young perish and the old linger.

822
01:22:39,999 --> 01:22:42,092
That I should live. . .

823
01:22:42,268 --> 01:22:45,635
. . .to see the last days of my house.

824
01:22:46,906 --> 01:22:50,774
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

825
01:22:52,812 --> 01:22:56,213
No parent should have to bury
their child.

826
01:23:12,933 --> 01:23:14,798
He was strong in life.

827
01:23:15,902 --> 01:23:19,463
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

828
01:24:01,084 --> 01:24:02,984
They had no warning.

829
01:24:03,152 --> 01:24:05,552
They were unarmed.

830
01:24:06,022 --> 01:24:10,049
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

831
01:24:10,994 --> 01:24:12,962
Rick, cot and tree.

832
01:24:13,263 --> 01:24:15,493
Where is Mama?

833
01:24:16,266 --> 01:24:20,498
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

834
01:24:20,703 --> 01:24:25,037
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

835
01:24:26,643 --> 01:24:29,612
Ride out and meet him head on.

836
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:33,872
Draw him away from your women
and children.

837
01:24:34,217 --> 01:24:35,844
You must fight.

838
01:24:36,019 --> 01:24:39,853
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

839
01:24:39,023 --> 01:24:40,650
Éomer is loyal to you.

840
01:24:40,824 --> 01:24:43,520
His men will return
and fight for their king.

841
01:24:43,694 --> 01:24:47,596
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

842
01:24:50,268 --> 01:24:52,498
Éomer cannot help us.

843
01:24:53,138 --> 01:24:54,901
I know what it is you want of me. . .

844
01:24:55,106 --> 01:24:58,371
. . .but I will not bring further death
to my people.

845
01:25:00,045 --> 01:25:01,740
I will not risk open war.

846
01:25:03,948 --> 01:25:07,315
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

847
01:25:10,589 --> 01:25:12,216
When last I looked. . .

848
01:25:12,658 --> 01:25:16,287
. . .Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

849
01:25:22,102 --> 01:25:24,366
Then what is the king's decision?

850
01:25:29,976 --> 01:25:31,307
By order of the king. . .

851
01:25:31,478 --> 01:25:32,945
. . .the city must empty.

852
01:25:34,114 --> 01:25:36,981
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

853
01:25:37,284 --> 01:25:41,186
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

854
01:25:41,388 --> 01:25:42,878
Helm's Deep.

855
01:25:43,056 --> 01:25:46,583
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

856
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,728
Who will defend them if not their king?

857
01:25:48,895 --> 01:25:51,363
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

858
01:25:51,531 --> 01:25:53,328
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

859
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:57,402
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

860
01:25:56,604 --> 01:25:58,765
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

861
01:25:58,973 --> 01:26:01,100
What they will get is a massacre.

862
01:26:02,677 --> 01:26:05,145
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

863
01:26:06,047 --> 01:26:09,380
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

864
01:26:09,851 --> 01:26:12,718
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

865
01:26:13,187 --> 01:26:15,985
The people of Rohan will need you.

866
01:26:16,357 --> 01:26:18,825
The defenses have to hold.

867
01:26:19,261 --> 01:26:20,990
They will hold.

868
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,298
The Grey Pilgrim.

869
01:26:27,469 --> 01:26:30,097
That's what they used to call me.

870
01:26:30,305 --> 01:26:35,368
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

871
01:26:36,012 --> 01:26:38,207
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

872
01:26:38,748 --> 01:26:42,047
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

873
01:26:42,919 --> 01:26:45,615
At dawn, look to the east.

874
01:26:45,789 --> 01:26:47,347
Go.

875
01:27:12,684 --> 01:27:16,017
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

876
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:55,119
His name is Brego.

877
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:58,530
He was my cousin's horse.

878
01:27:58,765 --> 01:28:00,562
Brego.

879
01:28:14,282 --> 01:28:16,682
I have heard of the magic of Elves. . .

880
01:28:16,851 --> 01:28:20,150
. . .but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

881
01:28:21,189 --> 01:28:23,623
You speak as one of their own.

882
01:28:25,426 --> 01:28:27,860
I was raised in Rivendell. . .

883
01:28:28,129 --> 01:28:29,653
. . .for a time.

884
01:28:32,967 --> 01:28:34,992
Turn this fellow free.

885
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:38,138
He's seen enough of war.

886
01:28:48,918 --> 01:28:51,785
Gandalf the White.

887
01:28:51,954 --> 01:28:54,320
Gandalf the Fool!

888
01:28:55,591 --> 01:28:59,652
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

889
01:29:00,896 --> 01:29:04,832
There were three
who followed the wizard.

890
01:29:05,234 --> 01:29:10,604
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

891
01:29:10,973 --> 01:29:13,703
You stink of horse.

892
01:29:18,981 --> 01:29:20,846
The Man. . .

893
01:29:21,885 --> 01:29:26,083
-. . .was he from Gondor?
-No, from the North.

894
01:29:26,256 --> 01:29:30,056
One of the Dûnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

895
01:29:30,226 --> 01:29:32,023
His cloth was poor.

896
01:29:32,929 --> 01:29:38,060
And yet he bore a strange ring.

897
01:29:39,169 --> 01:29:42,696
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

898
01:29:42,906 --> 01:29:48,742
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

899
01:29:48,912 --> 01:29:50,812
The Ring of Barahir.

900
01:29:51,781 --> 01:29:55,376
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

901
01:29:54,552 --> 01:29:57,885
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

902
01:29:58,055 --> 01:30:00,785
The line was broken years ago.

903
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:03,683
It matters not.

904
01:30:03,861 --> 01:30:06,386
The world of Men shall fall.

905
01:30:06,564 --> 01:30:08,429
It will begin at Edoras.

906
01:30:16,608 --> 01:30:18,542
I am ready, Gamling.

907
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:21,178
Bring my horse.

908
01:30:24,349 --> 01:30:25,714
This is not a defeat.

909
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:29,348
We will return.

910
01:30:34,793 --> 01:30:37,193
We will return.

911
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:00,553
You have some skill with a blade.

912
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:11,089
Women of this country learned long ago:

913
01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:13,893
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

914
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:15,899
I fear neither death nor pain.

915
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:19,264
What do you fear, my lady?

916
01:31:22,676 --> 01:31:24,507
A cage.

917
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:28,647
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

918
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:32,719
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

919
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:38,182
You're a daughter of kings. . .

920
01:31:39,461 --> 01:31:42,760
. . .a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

921
01:31:47,069 --> 01:31:49,560
I do not think that would be your fate.

922
01:32:21,638 --> 01:32:24,630
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.

923
01:32:24,841 --> 01:32:26,900
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

924
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:30,011
He will expect an attack on the city.

925
01:32:31,314 --> 01:32:34,579
They will flee to Helm's Deep. . .

926
01:32:34,751 --> 01:32:37,083
. . .the great fortress of Rohan.

927
01:32:37,288 --> 01:32:41,691
It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

928
01:32:43,127 --> 01:32:44,856
They will be slow.

929
01:32:44,229 --> 01:32:48,666
They will have women and children
with them.

930
01:32:52,571 --> 01:32:54,801
Send out your Warg-riders.

931
01:33:08,655 --> 01:33:11,556
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

932
01:33:11,724 --> 01:33:14,386
-Why do you do that?
-What?

933
01:33:14,561 --> 01:33:17,086
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

934
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:19,555
Because.

935
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:23,227
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

936
01:33:23,436 --> 01:33:25,597
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

937
01:33:26,072 --> 01:33:28,836
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

938
01:33:29,008 --> 01:33:31,272
You have no idea what it did to him. . .

939
01:33:31,444 --> 01:33:33,912
. . .what it's still doing to him.

940
01:33:36,149 --> 01:33:38,242
I want to help him, Sam.

941
01:33:38,418 --> 01:33:39,680
Why?

942
01:33:43,991 --> 01:33:47,119
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

943
01:33:51,365 --> 01:33:53,299
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

944
01:33:53,467 --> 01:33:56,197
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

945
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:07,308
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

946
01:34:08,148 --> 01:34:09,274
I do.

947
01:34:10,318 --> 01:34:12,183
It's the Ring.

948
01:34:12,754 --> 01:34:14,312
You can't take your eyes off it.

949
01:34:15,056 --> 01:34:17,024
I've seen you.

950
01:34:17,492 --> 01:34:21,326
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

951
01:34:22,098 --> 01:34:24,328
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

952
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,196
-You have to fight it.
-I know what I have to do, Sam.

953
01:34:27,403 --> 01:34:30,338
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

954
01:34:30,506 --> 01:34:32,201
Mine! My own!

955
01:34:33,075 --> 01:34:35,168
Can't you hear yourself?

956
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:37,039
Don't you know who you sound like?

957
01:34:47,323 --> 01:34:49,450
We wants it.

958
01:34:49,625 --> 01:34:52,321
We needs it.

959
01:34:52,495 --> 01:34:57,296
Must have the precious.

960
01:34:57,466 --> 01:35:00,833
They stole it from us.

961
01:35:01,037 --> 01:35:04,404
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

962
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:07,475
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

963
01:35:07,644 --> 01:35:10,909
No. Not master.

964
01:35:11,081 --> 01:35:14,915
Yes, precious. False.

965
01:35:15,085 --> 01:35:19,579
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

966
01:35:20,724 --> 01:35:23,192
Master's my friend.

967
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:27,423
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

968
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:31,191
Not listening. I'm not listening.

969
01:35:31,369 --> 01:35:35,362
You're a liar and a thief.

970
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:37,564
No.

971
01:35:38,509 --> 01:35:41,410
Murderer.

972
01:35:42,881 --> 01:35:43,905
Go away.

973
01:35:44,083 --> 01:35:46,449
Go away?

974
01:35:48,454 --> 01:35:51,252
I hate you.

975
01:35:51,423 --> 01:35:53,823
I hate you.

976
01:35:54,126 --> 01:35:57,425
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

977
01:35:57,596 --> 01:35:59,427
I saved us.

978
01:35:59,598 --> 01:36:04,126
It was me. We survived because of me.

979
01:36:04,371 --> 01:36:07,932
Not anymore.

980
01:36:09,309 --> 01:36:10,833
What did you say?

981
01:36:12,946 --> 01:36:16,780
Master looks after us now.

982
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:20,442
We don't need you.

983
01:36:21,154 --> 01:36:22,712
What?

984
01:36:22,889 --> 01:36:24,652
Leave now. . .

985
01:36:24,824 --> 01:36:28,624
. . .and never come back.

986
01:36:28,795 --> 01:36:29,819
No.

987
01:36:30,330 --> 01:36:34,528
Leave now and never come back.

988
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:42,075
Leave now and never come back!

989
01:36:52,988 --> 01:36:55,684
We told him to go away.

990
01:36:55,857 --> 01:36:58,826
And away he goes, precious.

991
01:36:58,994 --> 01:37:00,985
Gone! Gone! Gone!

992
01:37:01,163 --> 01:37:02,994
Sméagol is free!

993
01:37:07,869 --> 01:37:09,359
Look.

994
01:37:08,571 --> 01:37:13,031
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

995
01:37:22,585 --> 01:37:24,018
They are young.

996
01:37:24,187 --> 01:37:26,712
They are tender. They are nice.

997
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:30,416
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

998
01:37:32,129 --> 01:37:33,721
You'll make him sick, you will. . .

999
01:37:34,932 --> 01:37:37,127
. . .behaving like that.

1000
01:37:39,570 --> 01:37:42,300
There's only one way to eat
a brace of boneys.

1001
01:37:46,543 --> 01:37:48,067
What's it doing?

1002
01:37:48,812 --> 01:37:51,406
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1003
01:37:51,582 --> 01:37:53,777
It ruins it.

1004
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:57,580
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

1005
01:38:01,725 --> 01:38:04,285
What we need is a few good taters.

1006
01:38:05,162 --> 01:38:08,222
What's taters, precious?

1007
01:38:08,398 --> 01:38:10,127
What's taters? Eh?

1008
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:12,029
Po-ta-toes.

1009
01:38:09,369 --> 01:38:12,600
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1010
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:22,602
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1011
01:38:22,947 --> 01:38:24,847
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1012
01:38:25,183 --> 01:38:27,378
Oh, yes, we could.

1013
01:38:26,552 --> 01:38:30,044
Spoil a nice fish.

1014
01:38:31,323 --> 01:38:33,951
Give it to us raw. . .

1015
01:38:34,126 --> 01:38:37,152
. . .and wriggling.

1016
01:38:37,329 --> 01:38:40,457
You keep nasty chips.

1017
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,459
You're hopeless.

1018
01:38:54,948 --> 01:38:56,438
Mr. Frodo?

1019
01:39:13,334 --> 01:39:15,996
-Who are they?
-Wicked Men.

1020
01:39:16,204 --> 01:39:18,672
Servants of Sauron.

1021
01:39:19,473 --> 01:39:21,634
They are called to Mordor.

1022
01:39:21,842 --> 01:39:24,834
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

1023
01:39:25,046 --> 01:39:28,209
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1024
01:39:29,784 --> 01:39:33,447
-Ready to do what?
-To make his war.

1025
01:39:33,621 --> 01:39:38,786
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1026
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:41,120
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1027
01:39:41,296 --> 01:39:42,524
Mr. Frodo.

1028
01:39:43,031 --> 01:39:44,658
Look.

1029
01:39:48,237 --> 01:39:50,535
It's an oliphant.

1030
01:39:57,747 --> 01:40:00,773
No one at home will believe this.

1031
01:40:11,928 --> 01:40:13,793
Sméagol?

1032
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:54,638
We've lingered here too long.

1033
01:40:57,642 --> 01:40:58,973
Come on, Sam.

1034
01:41:10,457 --> 01:41:13,153
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1035
01:41:14,861 --> 01:41:19,958
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1036
01:41:20,133 --> 01:41:23,034
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1037
01:41:24,438 --> 01:41:27,805
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1038
01:41:27,974 --> 01:41:29,999
The enemy?

1039
01:41:32,112 --> 01:41:35,604
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1040
01:41:38,051 --> 01:41:40,110
You wonder what his name is. . .

1041
01:41:39,621 --> 01:41:41,885
. . .where he came from.

1042
01:41:43,859 --> 01:41:46,293
And if he was really evil at heart.

1043
01:41:47,963 --> 01:41:51,421
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1044
01:41:53,035 --> 01:41:55,526
If he would not rather have stayed there. . .

1045
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:59,230
. . .in peace.

1046
01:42:02,811 --> 01:42:05,837
War will make corpses of us all.

1047
01:42:06,014 --> 01:42:08,073
Bind their hands.

1048
01:42:08,074 --> 01:42:09,074
.

1049
01:42:15,722 --> 01:42:18,418
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

1050
01:42:18,625 --> 01:42:22,288
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance. . .

1051
01:42:22,462 --> 01:42:25,625
. . .that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

1052
01:42:26,032 --> 01:42:27,932
It's the beards.

1053
01:42:27,134 --> 01:42:29,261
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief. . .

1054
01:42:29,437 --> 01:42:32,304
. . .that there are no Dwarf women. . .

1055
01:42:32,473 --> 01:42:36,739
. . .and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground. . .

1056
01:42:38,412 --> 01:42:40,277
. . .which is, of course, ridiculous.

1057
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:47,650
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1058
01:42:48,123 --> 01:42:50,148
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1059
01:42:52,094 --> 01:42:55,894
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1060
01:42:56,164 --> 01:42:58,928
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1061
01:42:59,101 --> 01:43:01,399
Cut down by Orcs.

1062
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:04,562
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1063
01:43:05,173 --> 01:43:09,803
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1064
01:43:09,978 --> 01:43:14,540
Doomed to wait upon an old man
who should have loved her as a father.

1065
01:43:23,559 --> 01:43:25,925
Gimli.

1066
01:43:26,095 --> 01:43:28,154
No, I couldn't

1067
01:43:28,331 --> 01:43:30,162
I really couldn't.

1068
01:43:34,671 --> 01:43:36,298
I made some stew.

1069
01:43:36,472 --> 01:43:39,737
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1070
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:48,609
Thank you.

1071
01:44:08,106 --> 01:44:10,631
-It's good.
-Really?

1072
01:44:14,612 --> 01:44:17,979
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1073
01:44:18,284 --> 01:44:22,345
He said that you rode to war
with Théngel, my grandfather.

1074
01:44:22,788 --> 01:44:25,256
But he must be mistaken.

1075
01:44:25,524 --> 01:44:29,927
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1076
01:44:31,063 --> 01:44:34,260
Then you must be at least 60.

1077
01:44:36,369 --> 01:44:37,927
Seventy?

1078
01:44:38,371 --> 01:44:40,032
But you cannot be 80!

1079
01:44:42,376 --> 01:44:43,741
Eighty-seven.

1080
01:44:46,847 --> 01:44:48,940
You are one of the Dûnedain.

1081
01:44:50,016 --> 01:44:53,110
A descendant of Nûmenor,
blessed with long life.

1082
01:44:54,354 --> 01:44:56,982
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1083
01:44:57,657 --> 01:44:59,420
There are few of us left.

1084
01:44:59,593 --> 01:45:02,357
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1085
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:06,531
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1086
01:45:19,181 --> 01:45:23,311
The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.

1087
01:45:24,119 --> 01:45:27,555
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1088
01:45:29,391 --> 01:45:31,791
Like my heart.

1089
01:45:33,228 --> 01:45:35,924
Go to sleep.

1090
01:45:36,098 --> 01:45:38,589
I am asleep.

1091
01:45:45,073 --> 01:45:47,007
This is a dream.

1092
01:45:49,244 --> 01:45:52,441
Then it is a good dream.

1093
01:46:03,426 --> 01:46:05,519
Sleep.

1094
01:47:05,491 --> 01:47:07,391
Arwen. . . .

1095
01:47:54,842 --> 01:47:56,673
Where is she?

1096
01:47:57,845 --> 01:48:00,279
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1097
01:48:03,585 --> 01:48:06,349
Our time here is ending.

1098
01:48:07,055 --> 01:48:09,580
Arwen's time is ending.

1099
01:48:09,358 --> 01:48:10,620
Let her go.

1100
01:48:10,793 --> 01:48:12,784
Let her take the ship into the west.

1101
01:48:12,995 --> 01:48:16,055
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

1102
01:48:16,231 --> 01:48:18,028
There it will be ever green.

1103
01:48:19,535 --> 01:48:21,901
But never more than memory.

1104
01:48:23,172 --> 01:48:26,198
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

1105
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:30,004
-She stays because she still has hope.
-She stays for you.

1106
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:32,477
She belongs with her people.

1107
01:49:17,796 --> 01:49:19,627
Why are you saying this?

1108
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:24,396
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1109
01:49:25,837 --> 01:49:28,499
It was a dream, Arwen.

1110
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:30,305
Nothing more.

1111
01:49:31,677 --> 01:49:34,908
I don't believe you.

1112
01:49:43,922 --> 01:49:45,753
This belongs to you.

1113
01:49:48,527 --> 01:49:50,085
It was a gift.

1114
01:49:51,698 --> 01:49:53,222
Keep it.

1115
01:49:55,735 --> 01:49:56,929
My lord?

1116
01:49:59,739 --> 01:50:04,301
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1117
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,267
What is it?

1118
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:30,829
-Háma?
-I'm not sure.

1119
01:50:47,355 --> 01:50:49,380
Wargs!

1120
01:51:01,936 --> 01:51:03,631
A scout!

1121
01:51:09,944 --> 01:51:12,469
-What is it? What do you see?
-Warg! We're under attack!

1122
01:51:11,815 --> 01:51:14,010
Get them out of here!

1123
01:51:18,789 --> 01:51:20,780
All riders to the head of the column.

1124
01:51:21,525 --> 01:51:23,493
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1125
01:51:23,693 --> 01:51:25,422
Come on!

1126
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:39,674
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1127
01:51:39,876 --> 01:51:41,343
-I can fight.
-No!

1128
01:51:44,047 --> 01:51:46,106
You must do this, for me.

1129
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:48,710
Follow me!

1130
01:51:52,256 --> 01:51:56,556
-Forward. I mean, charge forward.
-Make for the lower ground!

1131
01:51:56,761 --> 01:51:59,423
-That's it! Go on!
-Stay together!

1132
01:53:07,636 --> 01:53:09,934
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1133
01:53:11,741 --> 01:53:13,299
That one counts as mine!

1134
01:53:31,026 --> 01:53:32,653
Stinking creature.

1135
01:54:56,848 --> 01:54:58,748
Aragorn!

1136
01:55:03,488 --> 01:55:04,955
Aragorn?

1137
01:55:16,936 --> 01:55:19,871
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1138
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:21,473
He's. . .

1139
01:55:22,042 --> 01:55:23,634
. . .dead.

1140
01:55:24,277 --> 01:55:27,178
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1141
01:55:30,784 --> 01:55:32,081
You lie.

1142
01:56:02,985 --> 01:56:04,577
Get the wounded on horses.

1143
01:56:05,922 --> 01:56:09,050
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1144
01:56:09,492 --> 01:56:11,585
Leave the dead.

1145
01:56:19,035 --> 01:56:20,525
Come.

1146
01:56:30,713 --> 01:56:32,237
-At last!
-Helm's Deep.

1147
01:56:32,415 --> 01:56:35,316
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1148
01:56:37,887 --> 01:56:39,684
We're safe!

1149
01:56:41,224 --> 01:56:44,091
We're safe, my lady.

1150
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:45,454
Thank you.

1151
01:57:27,839 --> 01:57:29,238
-Mama!
-Éothain!

1152
01:57:29,407 --> 01:57:30,897
Freda!

1153
01:57:36,648 --> 01:57:39,481
-Where is the rest?
-This is all we could save, my lady.

1154
01:57:43,354 --> 01:57:44,651
Take it to the caves.

1155
01:57:44,856 --> 01:57:47,689
Make way for the king.

1156
01:57:48,726 --> 01:57:52,526
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

1157
01:58:00,438 --> 01:58:04,169
So few. So few of you have returned.

1158
01:58:04,945 --> 01:58:07,209
Our people are safe.

1159
01:58:08,548 --> 01:58:11,108
We have paid for it with many lives.

1160
01:58:11,952 --> 01:58:13,476
My lady.

1161
01:58:17,224 --> 01:58:19,488
Lord Aragorn. . .

1162
01:58:18,659 --> 01:58:19,887
. . .where is he?

1163
01:58:21,896 --> 01:58:23,420
He fell.

1164
01:58:45,087 --> 01:58:48,056
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1165
01:58:48,223 --> 01:58:51,158
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1166
01:58:51,393 --> 01:58:54,487
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

1167
01:58:54,663 --> 01:58:57,257
Get them into the caves.

1168
01:58:58,133 --> 01:59:03,002
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1169
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:08,441
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.

1170
01:59:08,610 --> 01:59:10,942
Its outer wall is solid rock. . .

1171
01:59:10,113 --> 01:59:13,207
. . . but for a small culvert
at its base. . .

1172
01:59:13,383 --> 01:59:16,147
. . . which is little more than a drain.

1173
01:59:19,022 --> 01:59:23,186
How? How can fire undo stone?

1174
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:27,853
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1175
01:59:31,467 --> 01:59:35,460
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1176
01:59:34,638 --> 01:59:38,165
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning. . .

1177
01:59:38,342 --> 01:59:40,902
. . .thousands, to storm the Keep.

1178
01:59:41,078 --> 01:59:42,511
Tens of thousands.

1179
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:46,741
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1180
01:59:57,696 --> 02:00:00,790
A new power is rising.

1181
02:00:00,965 --> 02:00:03,957
It's victory is at hand.

1182
02:00:09,641 --> 02:00:11,700
This night. . .

1183
02:00:11,143 --> 02:00:15,477
. . .the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1184
02:00:15,648 --> 02:00:18,981
March to Helm's Deep!

1185
02:00:19,151 --> 02:00:22,587
Leave none alive!

1186
02:00:25,124 --> 02:00:27,592
To war!

1187
02:00:31,530 --> 02:00:35,990
There will be no dawn for Men.

1188
02:00:53,185 --> 02:00:55,244
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1189
02:00:55,454 --> 02:00:58,582
There is always smoke rising. . .

1190
02:00:58,824 --> 02:01:02,658
. . .from Isengard these days.

1191
02:01:02,895 --> 02:01:04,487
Isengard?

1192
02:01:04,697 --> 02:01:06,562
There was a time. . .

1193
02:01:06,899 --> 02:01:10,426
. . .when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1194
02:01:10,603 --> 02:01:13,970
But now he has a mind of metal. . .

1195
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:17,074
. . .and wheels.

1196
02:01:16,843 --> 02:01:21,337
He no longer cares for growing things.

1197
02:01:21,515 --> 02:01:23,312
What is it?

1198
02:01:26,321 --> 02:01:28,516
It's Saruman's army.

1199
02:01:28,724 --> 02:01:30,248
The war has started.

1200
02:02:08,630 --> 02:02:12,999
May the grace of the Valar
protect you.

1201
02:02:45,267 --> 02:02:47,132
Brego.

1202
02:03:10,262 --> 02:03:11,456
Arwen.

1203
02:03:21,239 --> 02:03:23,036
I have made my choice.

1204
02:03:27,481 --> 02:03:30,348
He is not coming back.

1205
02:03:31,785 --> 02:03:35,118
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1206
02:03:36,056 --> 02:03:39,025
There is still hope.

1207
02:03:43,196 --> 02:03:46,962
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1208
02:03:50,370 --> 02:03:53,339
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king. . .

1209
02:03:53,507 --> 02:03:55,998
. . .and all that you hope for
comes true. . .

1210
02:03:56,176 --> 02:04:00,875
. . .you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1211
02:04:01,148 --> 02:04:04,140
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time. . .

1212
02:04:04,318 --> 02:04:07,287
. . .Aragorn will die.

1213
02:04:10,123 --> 02:04:12,648
And there will be no comfort
for you. . .

1214
02:04:12,859 --> 02:04:17,023
. . . no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.

1215
02:04:18,833 --> 02:04:21,563
He will come to death. . .

1216
02:04:21,736 --> 02:04:24,330
. . . an Image of the splendor
of the kings of Men. . .

1217
02:04:24,505 --> 02:04:29,169
. . .In glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

1218
02:04:37,286 --> 02:04:41,222
But you, my daughter. . .

1219
02:04:42,057 --> 02:04:47,085
. . .you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt. . .

1220
02:04:47,262 --> 02:04:51,323
. . . as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

1221
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:56,136
Here you will dwell. . .

1222
02:04:56,305 --> 02:05:01,208
. . . bound to your grief
under the fading trees. . .

1223
02:05:01,945 --> 02:05:03,936
. . . until all the world is changed. . .

1224
02:05:04,114 --> 02:05:08,608
. . .and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1225
02:05:16,127 --> 02:05:17,287
Arwen.

1226
02:05:23,934 --> 02:05:26,198
There is nothing for you here. . .

1227
02:05:26,871 --> 02:05:28,964
. . .only death.

1228
02:06:58,433 --> 02:07:02,062
The power of the enemy is growing.

1229
02:07:02,237 --> 02:07:04,865
Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman. . .

1230
02:07:05,039 --> 02:07:08,406
. . . to destroy the people of Rohan.

1231
02:07:08,478 --> 02:07:12,107
Isengard has been unleashed.

1232
02:07:16,453 --> 02:07:19,820
The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor. . .

1233
02:07:20,957 --> 02:07:23,926
. . . the last free kingdom of Men.

1234
02:07:24,127 --> 02:07:28,530
His war on this country
will come swiftly.

1235
02:07:32,235 --> 02:07:35,329
He senses the Ring Is close.

1236
02:07:35,505 --> 02:07:38,963
The strength of the Ring-bearer
Is failing.

1237
02:07:39,142 --> 02:07:43,203
In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand. . .

1238
02:07:44,748 --> 02:07:48,616
. . .the quest will claim his life.

1239
02:07:47,785 --> 02:07:49,946
You know this.

1240
02:07:50,588 --> 02:07:53,421
You have foreseen it.

1241
02:07:55,526 --> 02:07:58,962
It is the risk we all took.

1242
02:08:03,301 --> 02:08:07,499
In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.

1243
02:08:08,673 --> 02:08:13,110
It works hard now to find its way back
Into the hands of Men.

1244
02:08:12,277 --> 02:08:17,738
Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.

1245
02:08:17,950 --> 02:08:21,511
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand. . .

1246
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:25,781
. . . take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

1247
02:08:28,227 --> 02:08:30,058
It is close now.

1248
02:08:30,229 --> 02:08:34,495
So close to achieving its goal.

1249
02:08:37,603 --> 02:08:41,232
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth. . .

1250
02:08:40,406 --> 02:08:44,536
. . . even unto to the ending
of the world.

1251
02:08:46,379 --> 02:08:48,210
The time of the Elves. . .

1252
02:08:48,414 --> 02:08:50,348
. . .Is over.

1253
02:08:51,184 --> 02:08:54,779
Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?

1254
02:08:56,756 --> 02:09:00,021
Do we let them stand alone?

1255
02:09:03,564 --> 02:09:04,929
What news?

1256
02:09:05,099 --> 02:09:07,897
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1257
02:09:08,068 --> 02:09:10,935
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

1258
02:09:11,105 --> 02:09:15,132
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1259
02:09:15,309 --> 02:09:17,709
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1260
02:09:18,045 --> 02:09:20,172
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1261
02:09:20,347 --> 02:09:23,748
-How many?
-Some thousands. More come every day.

1262
02:09:24,852 --> 02:09:28,413
-Who's covering the river to the north?
-We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1263
02:09:28,622 --> 02:09:31,648
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1264
02:09:31,794 --> 02:09:33,989
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1265
02:09:34,163 --> 02:09:36,859
Sauron from Mordor.

1266
02:09:38,167 --> 02:09:41,398
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

1267
02:09:41,570 --> 02:09:43,265
Gondor is weak.

1268
02:09:43,439 --> 02:09:46,567
Sauron will strike us soon.

1269
02:09:47,310 --> 02:09:49,175
And he will strike hard.

1270
02:09:49,612 --> 02:09:53,708
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1271
02:10:07,596 --> 02:10:09,826
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1272
02:10:09,999 --> 02:10:12,729
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1273
02:10:12,902 --> 02:10:15,166
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1274
02:10:20,044 --> 02:10:21,773
Speak.

1275
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:25,474
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1276
02:10:25,817 --> 02:10:28,843
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1277
02:10:29,287 --> 02:10:30,777
Your bodyguard?

1278
02:10:30,989 --> 02:10:32,752
His gardener.

1279
02:10:33,391 --> 02:10:35,359
And where is your skulking friend?

1280
02:10:36,894 --> 02:10:39,192
That gangrel creature.

1281
02:10:39,530 --> 02:10:41,498
He had an ill-favored look.

1282
02:10:43,234 --> 02:10:45,134
There was no other.

1283
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:51,572
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1284
02:10:53,912 --> 02:10:56,972
One we lost in Moria. . .

1285
02:10:58,050 --> 02:10:59,574
. . .two were my kin. . .

1286
02:10:59,752 --> 02:11:03,483
. . .a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1287
02:11:03,689 --> 02:11:07,591
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1288
02:11:12,598 --> 02:11:14,361
You're a friend of Boromir?

1289
02:11:16,802 --> 02:11:18,292
Yes.

1290
02:11:18,371 --> 02:11:19,463
For my part.

1291
02:11:25,979 --> 02:11:28,914
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1292
02:11:29,950 --> 02:11:31,417
Dead?

1293
02:11:31,619 --> 02:11:33,644
How? When?

1294
02:11:33,921 --> 02:11:36,549
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1295
02:11:36,891 --> 02:11:40,725
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1296
02:11:43,464 --> 02:11:49,926
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1297
02:11:50,137 --> 02:11:53,231
It was cloven in two.

1298
02:11:54,842 --> 02:11:58,243
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1299
02:11:59,281 --> 02:12:01,078
He was my brother.

1300
02:12:47,031 --> 02:12:50,000
Boromir!

1301
02:12:50,535 --> 02:12:52,400
Boromir!

1302
02:12:56,641 --> 02:13:00,407
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

1303
02:13:00,578 --> 02:13:04,241
A place of light and beauty and music.

1304
02:13:04,415 --> 02:13:06,747
And so it shall be once more!

1305
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:11,948
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1306
02:13:12,157 --> 02:13:16,526
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1307
02:13:20,331 --> 02:13:25,997
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1308
02:13:26,371 --> 02:13:28,339
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!

1309
02:13:28,506 --> 02:13:31,339
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!

1310
02:13:39,051 --> 02:13:41,815
Good speech. Nice and short.

1311
02:13:42,021 --> 02:13:44,922
Leaves more time for drinking!

1312
02:13:45,224 --> 02:13:49,422
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1313
02:13:52,865 --> 02:13:55,026
Remember today, little brother.

1314
02:13:55,201 --> 02:13:58,193
Today, life is good.

1315
02:14:01,374 --> 02:14:02,966
What?

1316
02:14:03,343 --> 02:14:04,810
He's here.

1317
02:14:08,014 --> 02:14:09,845
One moment of peace,
can he not give us that?

1318
02:14:10,016 --> 02:14:11,040
Where is he?

1319
02:14:11,218 --> 02:14:14,676
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1320
02:14:15,255 --> 02:14:16,950
Father!

1321
02:14:21,828 --> 02:14:24,194
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1322
02:14:23,364 --> 02:14:26,765
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1323
02:14:27,236 --> 02:14:30,137
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1324
02:14:30,939 --> 02:14:33,237
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1325
02:14:33,408 --> 02:14:35,433
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1326
02:14:35,611 --> 02:14:37,306
Oh, too few.

1327
02:14:37,813 --> 02:14:40,213
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1328
02:14:42,417 --> 02:14:45,409
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1329
02:14:45,621 --> 02:14:47,851
That is not my intent.

1330
02:14:48,056 --> 02:14:51,822
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1331
02:14:55,197 --> 02:14:58,098
-He loves you, Father.
-Do not trouble me with Faramir. . .

1332
02:14:58,267 --> 02:15:01,031
. . . I know his uses, and they are few.

1333
02:15:01,203 --> 02:15:04,798
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1334
02:15:05,974 --> 02:15:08,408
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1335
02:15:08,577 --> 02:15:11,444
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1336
02:15:11,613 --> 02:15:15,413
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1337
02:15:17,653 --> 02:15:19,917
The One Ring.

1338
02:15:21,691 --> 02:15:26,355
-Isildur's Bane.
-It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1339
02:15:26,529 --> 02:15:30,158
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1340
02:15:30,333 --> 02:15:34,463
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1341
02:15:35,272 --> 02:15:37,934
-Gondor.
-It's dangerous, I know.

1342
02:15:38,108 --> 02:15:41,805
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

1343
02:15:41,979 --> 02:15:45,881
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1344
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:51,352
It is our blood, which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1345
02:15:51,555 --> 02:15:56,583
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1346
02:15:55,794 --> 02:15:57,261
He will return.

1347
02:15:57,462 --> 02:16:01,193
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1348
02:16:01,366 --> 02:16:03,926
You must go.

1349
02:16:05,103 --> 02:16:07,196
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1350
02:16:08,039 --> 02:16:13,534
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1351
02:16:13,712 --> 02:16:17,409
-Would you deny your own father?
-If there is need to go to Rivendell. . .

1352
02:16:17,582 --> 02:16:20,551
-. . .send me in his stead.
-You?

1353
02:16:20,753 --> 02:16:22,687
Oh, I see.

1354
02:16:22,855 --> 02:16:27,053
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

1355
02:16:27,493 --> 02:16:29,461
I think not.

1356
02:16:29,662 --> 02:16:32,529
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1357
02:16:32,698 --> 02:16:35,599
The one who will not fail me.

1358
02:16:51,685 --> 02:16:54,848
Remember today, little brother.

1359
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:14,231
Captain Faramir!

1360
02:17:15,510 --> 02:17:17,637
We found the third one.

1361
02:17:28,157 --> 02:17:30,125
You must come with me. Now.

1362
02:17:41,336 --> 02:17:42,428
Down there.

1363
02:17:56,352 --> 02:17:59,253
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1364
02:18:09,866 --> 02:18:11,356
They wait for my command.

1365
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:16,932
Shall I shoot?

1366
02:18:18,175 --> 02:18:21,201
The rock and pool
Is nice and cool

1367
02:18:21,378 --> 02:18:23,209
So juicy sweet

1368
02:18:23,848 --> 02:18:26,817
Our only wish
To catch a fish

1369
02:18:26,984 --> 02:18:29,680
So juicy sweet

1370
02:18:36,660 --> 02:18:38,059
Wait.

1371
02:18:38,563 --> 02:18:41,396
This creature is bound to me.

1372
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,934
And I to him.

1373
02:18:47,205 --> 02:18:48,502
He is our guide.

1374
02:18:53,245 --> 02:18:54,644
Please. . .

1375
02:18:54,813 --> 02:18:56,678
. . .let me go down to him.

1376
02:19:06,993 --> 02:19:08,654
Sméagol.

1377
02:19:09,662 --> 02:19:11,892
Master is here.

1378
02:19:13,099 --> 02:19:14,225
Come, Sméagol.

1379
02:19:17,103 --> 02:19:19,731
Trust master. Come.

1380
02:19:22,909 --> 02:19:26,743
We must go now?

1381
02:19:26,113 --> 02:19:29,549
Sméagol, you must trust master.

1382
02:19:29,716 --> 02:19:31,115
Follow me. Come on.

1383
02:19:32,352 --> 02:19:33,842
Come.

1384
02:19:36,390 --> 02:19:37,550
Come, Sméagol.

1385
02:19:38,091 --> 02:19:40,116
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

1386
02:19:40,661 --> 02:19:42,151
Come on.

1387
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:48,261
Don't hurt him!

1388
02:19:48,435 --> 02:19:51,165
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

1389
02:19:51,338 --> 02:19:52,635
Master!

1390
02:20:14,864 --> 02:20:17,230
That's enough.

1391
02:20:20,870 --> 02:20:23,031
Where are you leading them?

1392
02:20:24,841 --> 02:20:26,502
Answer me.

1393
02:20:27,310 --> 02:20:30,541
Sméagol.

1394
02:20:30,542 --> 02:20:31,542
.

1395
02:20:36,542 --> 02:20:36,542
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

1396
02:24:01,492 --> 02:24:02,407
Prepare to leave.

1397
02:24:07,492 --> 02:24:09,926
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1398
02:25:19,833 --> 02:25:22,461
-He's alive!
-Where is he? Where is he?

1399
02:25:22,636 --> 02:25:25,696
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1400
02:25:24,906 --> 02:25:28,637
You are the luckiest, the canniest. . .

1401
02:25:28,843 --> 02:25:32,836
. . .and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1402
02:25:33,548 --> 02:25:35,015
Bless you, laddie.

1403
02:25:35,616 --> 02:25:37,345
Gimli, where is the king?

1404
02:25:49,132 --> 02:25:50,463
You look terrible.

1405
02:26:30,208 --> 02:26:32,233
A great host, you say?

1406
02:26:32,444 --> 02:26:35,106
-All Isengard is emptied.
-How many?

1407
02:26:35,781 --> 02:26:38,773
Ten thousand strong at least.

1408
02:26:40,318 --> 02:26:41,751
Ten thousand?

1409
02:26:42,187 --> 02:26:44,678
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1410
02:26:47,359 --> 02:26:49,486
To destroy the world of Men.

1411
02:26:51,997 --> 02:26:53,988
They will be here by nightfall.

1412
02:26:59,838 --> 02:27:01,135
Let them come!

1413
02:27:02,674 --> 02:27:05,404
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms. . .

1414
02:27:05,610 --> 02:27:08,738
. . .to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1415
02:27:15,922 --> 02:27:18,857
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1416
02:27:19,025 --> 02:27:21,459
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall. . .

1417
02:27:21,627 --> 02:27:24,357
. . .or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1418
02:27:24,530 --> 02:27:26,930
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1419
02:27:27,533 --> 02:27:29,728
These are Uruk-hai.

1420
02:27:29,902 --> 02:27:33,338
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1421
02:27:35,007 --> 02:27:38,636
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1422
02:27:38,845 --> 02:27:42,440
I know how to defend my own keep.

1423
02:27:47,055 --> 02:27:50,456
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1424
02:27:50,625 --> 02:27:55,858
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1425
02:27:56,064 --> 02:27:58,726
Crops can be resown. . .

1426
02:27:58,900 --> 02:28:01,892
. . . homes rebuilt.

1427
02:28:02,504 --> 02:28:05,064
Within these walls. . .

1428
02:28:05,473 --> 02:28:06,940
. . .we will outlast them.

1429
02:28:07,142 --> 02:28:09,542
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1430
02:28:09,711 --> 02:28:11,235
They come to destroy its people. . .

1431
02:28:11,379 --> 02:28:13,847
. . .down to the last child.

1432
02:28:14,749 --> 02:28:17,013
What would you have me do?

1433
02:28:17,185 --> 02:28:18,914
Look at my men.

1434
02:28:19,087 --> 02:28:20,816
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1435
02:28:23,024 --> 02:28:27,427
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end. . .

1436
02:28:27,595 --> 02:28:30,621
. . .as to be worthy of remembrance.

1437
02:28:33,269 --> 02:28:35,169
Send out riders, my lord.

1438
02:28:35,471 --> 02:28:38,338
You must call for aid.

1439
02:28:41,644 --> 02:28:43,908
And who will come?

1440
02:28:44,313 --> 02:28:45,905
Elves?

1441
02:28:46,081 --> 02:28:48,140
Dwarves?

1442
02:28:48,918 --> 02:28:51,785
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1443
02:28:51,621 --> 02:28:53,885
The old alliances are dead.

1444
02:28:54,324 --> 02:28:57,122
-Gondor will answer.
-Gondor?!

1445
02:28:57,294 --> 02:28:59,489
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1446
02:29:00,463 --> 02:29:03,694
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1447
02:29:03,867 --> 02:29:05,801
Where was Gon--?

1448
02:29:08,471 --> 02:29:10,371
No, my Lord Aragorn. . .

1449
02:29:10,975 --> 02:29:13,443
. . .we are alone.

1450
02:29:19,318 --> 02:29:21,047
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1451
02:29:21,220 --> 02:29:22,482
We need more time
to lay provisions--

1452
02:29:22,654 --> 02:29:26,146
There is no time. War is upon us.

1453
02:29:26,425 --> 02:29:28,120
Secure the gate.

1454
02:29:33,332 --> 02:29:35,425
We Ents have not troubled. . .

1455
02:29:35,634 --> 02:29:39,001
. . .about the wars of Men and wizards. . .

1456
02:29:39,771 --> 02:29:42,763
. . .for a very long time.

1457
02:29:44,042 --> 02:29:48,809
But now, something
is about to happen. . .

1458
02:29:48,981 --> 02:29:51,313
. . .that has not happened. . .

1459
02:29:51,516 --> 02:29:53,984
. . .for an age.

1460
02:29:55,187 --> 02:29:57,451
Entmoot.

1461
02:29:56,889 --> 02:29:57,878
What's that?

1462
02:29:58,291 --> 02:30:01,124
'Tis a gathering.

1463
02:30:02,328 --> 02:30:04,888
A gathering of what?

1464
02:30:22,849 --> 02:30:25,215
Beech. Oak.

1465
02:30:25,385 --> 02:30:27,285
Chestnut. Ash.

1466
02:30:27,553 --> 02:30:29,521
Good. Good. Good.

1467
02:30:28,689 --> 02:30:31,055
Many have come.

1468
02:30:36,599 --> 02:30:39,363
Now we must decide
if the Ents. . .

1469
02:30:39,535 --> 02:30:42,095
. . .will go to war.

1470
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:54,140
Move back! Move to the caves!

1471
02:30:56,619 --> 02:30:58,678
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1472
02:30:59,088 --> 02:31:01,386
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1473
02:31:01,557 --> 02:31:03,787
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1474
02:31:03,959 --> 02:31:07,087
Aragorn, you must rest.

1475
02:31:07,263 --> 02:31:09,663
You're no use to us half alive.

1476
02:31:10,132 --> 02:31:11,326
Aragorn!

1477
02:31:14,737 --> 02:31:17,763
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1478
02:31:17,973 --> 02:31:19,600
That is an honorable charge.

1479
02:31:19,809 --> 02:31:22,676
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1480
02:31:22,845 --> 02:31:24,540
What renown is there in that?

1481
02:31:24,714 --> 02:31:28,411
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1482
02:31:28,684 --> 02:31:31,482
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1483
02:31:31,654 --> 02:31:36,648
-Let me stand at your side.
-It is not in my power to command it.

1484
02:31:36,959 --> 02:31:39,757
You do not command
the others to stay!

1485
02:31:39,929 --> 02:31:43,695
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1486
02:31:43,867 --> 02:31:46,062
Because they love you.

1487
02:31:52,210 --> 02:31:53,700
I'm sorry.

1488
02:32:57,644 --> 02:33:00,875
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1489
02:33:01,948 --> 02:33:03,745
These are no soldiers.

1490
02:33:06,019 --> 02:33:09,477
-Most have seen too many winters.
-Or too few.

1491
02:33:12,426 --> 02:33:15,327
Look at them. They're frightened.

1492
02:33:15,496 --> 02:33:16,963
I can see it in their eyes.

1493
02:33:35,952 --> 02:33:38,147
Then I shall die as one of them!

1494
02:33:44,594 --> 02:33:46,425
Let him go, lad.

1495
02:33:46,996 --> 02:33:48,964
Let him be.

1496
02:33:50,433 --> 02:33:55,894
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1497
02:34:00,142 --> 02:34:02,042
My lord?

1498
02:34:04,113 --> 02:34:06,673
Who am I, Gamling?

1499
02:34:09,052 --> 02:34:12,954
You are our king, sire.

1500
02:34:15,959 --> 02:34:19,224
And do you trust your king?

1501
02:34:20,764 --> 02:34:23,927
Your men, my lord will follow you
to what ever end

1502
02:34:33,810 --> 02:34:35,710
To whatever end.

1503
02:34:44,556 --> 02:34:48,117
Where is the horse and the rider?

1504
02:34:48,293 --> 02:34:51,353
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1505
02:34:52,864 --> 02:34:57,233
They have passed like rain
on the mountains.

1506
02:34:57,236 --> 02:35:00,467
Like wind in the meadow.

1507
02:35:04,176 --> 02:35:07,942
The days have gone down in the West. . .

1508
02:35:08,647 --> 02:35:11,275
. . . behind the hills. . .

1509
02:35:13,185 --> 02:35:14,812
. . .Into Shadow.

1510
02:35:22,262 --> 02:35:25,698
How did it come to this?

1511
02:35:45,020 --> 02:35:46,885
It's been going for hours.

1512
02:35:48,023 --> 02:35:50,389
They must have decided something
by now.

1513
02:35:50,559 --> 02:35:54,655
Decided? No.

1514
02:35:54,830 --> 02:35:59,961
We only just finished saying. . .

1515
02:36:01,169 --> 02:36:03,034
. . .good morning.

1516
02:36:04,406 --> 02:36:07,569
But it's nighttime already.

1517
02:36:07,776 --> 02:36:09,573
You can't take forever.

1518
02:36:10,579 --> 02:36:12,604
Don't be hasty.

1519
02:36:13,081 --> 02:36:15,481
We're running out of time!

1520
02:36:18,487 --> 02:36:21,456
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1521
02:36:38,041 --> 02:36:39,338
Give me your sword.

1522
02:36:48,851 --> 02:36:49,977
What is your name?

1523
02:36:50,520 --> 02:36:52,886
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

1524
02:36:54,024 --> 02:36:56,652
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.

1525
02:36:58,629 --> 02:37:00,597
They say that it is hopeless.

1526
02:37:18,449 --> 02:37:20,076
This is a good sword.

1527
02:37:22,119 --> 02:37:24,451
Haleth, son of Háma. . .

1528
02:37:27,792 --> 02:37:29,953
. . .there is always hope.

1529
02:37:51,884 --> 02:37:55,251
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1530
02:37:55,421 --> 02:37:56,979
Forgive me.

1531
02:37:57,156 --> 02:37:58,589
I was wrong to despair.

1532
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:10,598
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1533
02:38:14,073 --> 02:38:16,098
It's a little tight across the chest.

1534
02:38:21,214 --> 02:38:23,182
That is no Orc horn.

1535
02:38:28,855 --> 02:38:30,686
Send for the king.

1536
02:38:30,857 --> 02:38:34,452
-Open the gate!
-Open up the gate!

1537
02:39:04,093 --> 02:39:05,754
How is this possible?

1538
02:39:06,762 --> 02:39:10,391
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1539
02:39:10,566 --> 02:39:13,797
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1540
02:39:14,503 --> 02:39:18,735
Long ago we fought and died together.

1541
02:39:20,043 --> 02:39:22,944
We come to honor that allegiance.

1542
02:39:31,421 --> 02:39:33,355
You are most welcome.

1543
02:39:38,728 --> 02:39:42,664
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1544
02:40:14,332 --> 02:40:17,597
You could have picked a better spot.

1545
02:40:22,507 --> 02:40:26,671
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1546
02:40:31,851 --> 02:40:33,648
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1547
02:40:34,287 --> 02:40:36,778
Let's hope they last the night.

1548
02:42:14,190 --> 02:42:16,988
-What's happening out there?
-Shall I describe it to you?

1549
02:42:18,261 --> 02:42:20,058
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1550
02:43:20,259 --> 02:43:22,056
So it begins.

1551
02:43:37,259 --> 02:43:39,759
their armors are weak
 at the neck

1552
02:43:47,888 --> 02:43:49,253
Did they hit anything?

1553
02:43:49,923 --> 02:43:51,914
Give them a volley.

1554
02:43:52,092 --> 02:43:54,185
-Fire!
-Fire!

1555
02:44:08,943 --> 02:44:10,638
Send them to me! Come on!

1556
02:44:29,332 --> 02:44:30,424
Good!

1557
02:44:37,240 --> 02:44:40,209
Swords! Swords!

1558
02:45:18,348 --> 02:45:20,475
Legolas! Two already!

1559
02:45:20,650 --> 02:45:22,777
I'm on 1 7!

1560
02:45:22,953 --> 02:45:25,513
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1561
02:45:31,262 --> 02:45:32,991
Nineteen!

1562
02:45:56,990 --> 02:45:58,423
Merry.

1563
02:46:02,829 --> 02:46:06,629
We have just agreed.

1564
02:46:16,676 --> 02:46:18,143
Yes?

1565
02:46:19,646 --> 02:46:23,810
I have told your names to the Entmoot. . .

1566
02:46:24,951 --> 02:46:28,114
. . .and we have agreed. . .

1567
02:46:27,588 --> 02:46:31,615
. . .you are not Orcs.

1568
02:46:33,360 --> 02:46:35,487
Well, that's good news.

1569
02:46:35,663 --> 02:46:39,793
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1570
02:46:40,434 --> 02:46:44,234
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1571
02:46:44,405 --> 02:46:45,929
Hasty?

1572
02:46:46,740 --> 02:46:48,640
Our friends are out there.

1573
02:46:47,809 --> 02:46:51,973
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1574
02:46:52,314 --> 02:46:54,578
War? Yes.

1575
02:46:54,749 --> 02:46:56,649
It affects us all.

1576
02:46:56,818 --> 02:46:59,810
Tree, root and twig.

1577
02:47:00,689 --> 02:47:04,716
But you must understand, young Hobbit. . .

1578
02:47:04,926 --> 02:47:06,860
. . .it takes a long time. . .

1579
02:47:07,028 --> 02:47:11,931
. . .to say anything in Old Entish. . .

1580
02:47:12,100 --> 02:47:16,332
. . .and we never say anything. . .

1581
02:47:16,504 --> 02:47:20,440
. . . unless it is worth taking. . .

1582
02:47:19,609 --> 02:47:23,568
. . .a long time to say.

1583
02:47:24,380 --> 02:47:27,679
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1584
02:47:27,850 --> 02:47:28,908
Nineteen!

1585
02:47:29,485 --> 02:47:31,350
Twenty!

1586
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:33,181
Twenty-one!

1587
02:47:41,266 --> 02:47:43,257
Causeway!

1588
02:47:51,075 --> 02:47:53,441
Is this it?

1589
02:47:53,611 --> 02:47:56,546
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1590
02:48:22,780 --> 02:48:25,230
legolis kill the urukai fire holder

1591
02:48:27,347 --> 02:48:28,347
kill him
kill him

1592
02:49:19,533 --> 02:49:20,898
Brace the gate!

1593
02:49:37,253 --> 02:49:39,517
Hold them! Stand firm!

1594
02:49:47,397 --> 02:49:48,728
Aragorn!

1595
02:49:53,369 --> 02:49:54,563
Gimli!

1596
02:50:41,319 --> 02:50:45,255
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1597
02:50:46,024 --> 02:50:50,051
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1598
02:50:50,862 --> 02:50:52,955
How can that be your decision?!

1599
02:50:53,631 --> 02:50:57,260
This is not our war.

1600
02:50:57,569 --> 02:50:59,764
But you're part of this world!

1601
02:51:03,942 --> 02:51:05,773
Aren't you?!

1602
02:51:09,848 --> 02:51:12,214
You must help. Please.

1603
02:51:13,451 --> 02:51:16,215
You must do something.

1604
02:51:15,488 --> 02:51:19,788
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1605
02:51:20,993 --> 02:51:24,724
But your part in this tale is over.

1606
02:51:24,897 --> 02:51:27,127
Go back to your home.

1607
02:51:36,176 --> 02:51:38,440
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1608
02:51:38,612 --> 02:51:40,477
We don't belong here, Merry.

1609
02:51:40,647 --> 02:51:42,911
It's too big for us.

1610
02:51:43,083 --> 02:51:45,745
What can we do in the end?

1611
02:51:48,054 --> 02:51:50,682
We've got the Shire.

1612
02:51:51,224 --> 02:51:53,749
Maybe we should go home.

1613
02:51:55,595 --> 02:51:58,826
The fires of Isengard will spread. . .

1614
02:51:58,999 --> 02:52:03,902
. . .and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1615
02:52:04,070 --> 02:52:05,662
And. . . .

1616
02:52:07,507 --> 02:52:10,533
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1617
02:52:12,047 --> 02:52:14,982
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1618
02:52:34,503 --> 02:52:35,731
Aragorn!

1619
02:52:35,904 --> 02:52:38,270
Fall back to the Keep!

1620
02:52:38,473 --> 02:52:41,533
Get your men out of there!

1621
02:52:50,219 --> 02:52:51,880
Haldir!

1622
02:52:53,247 --> 02:52:54,747
retreat

1623
02:52:55,992 --> 02:52:59,257
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1624
02:53:18,448 --> 02:53:19,676
Haldir!

1625
02:53:59,392 --> 02:54:00,882
Brace the gate!

1626
02:54:03,129 --> 02:54:04,426
Hold them!

1627
02:54:06,198 --> 02:54:09,565
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1628
02:54:35,730 --> 02:54:37,664
Make way!

1629
02:54:40,568 --> 02:54:42,297
We cannot hold much longer!

1630
02:54:48,309 --> 02:54:51,836
-Hold them!
-How long do you need?

1631
02:54:52,046 --> 02:54:54,606
As long as you can give me.

1632
02:54:54,782 --> 02:54:56,443
Gimli!

1633
02:54:57,919 --> 02:54:59,284
Timbers!

1634
02:54:59,454 --> 02:55:01,422
Brace the gate!

1635
02:55:15,137 --> 02:55:16,832
Come on. We can take them.

1636
02:55:17,706 --> 02:55:19,298
It's a long way.

1637
02:55:24,580 --> 02:55:26,343
Toss me.

1638
02:55:27,516 --> 02:55:29,347
-What?
-I cannot jump the distance!

1639
02:55:29,518 --> 02:55:31,076
You'll have to toss me!

1640
02:55:34,692 --> 02:55:35,954
Don't tell the Elf.

1641
02:55:36,494 --> 02:55:38,257
Not a word.

1642
02:55:53,544 --> 02:55:54,977
Shore up the door!

1643
02:55:55,146 --> 02:55:57,239
-Make way!
-Follow me to the barricade.

1644
02:55:57,414 --> 02:55:58,472
Watch our backs!

1645
02:56:02,553 --> 02:56:04,783
-Throw another one over here!
-Higher!

1646
02:56:52,772 --> 02:56:54,171
Hold fast the gate!

1647
02:56:58,377 --> 02:57:01,312
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1648
02:57:06,052 --> 02:57:07,644
Aragorn!

1649
02:57:39,120 --> 02:57:41,554
Pull everybody back.

1650
02:57:41,923 --> 02:57:43,720
Pull them back.

1651
02:57:44,259 --> 02:57:45,726
Fall back!

1652
02:57:45,894 --> 02:57:48,385
Fall back!

1653
02:57:49,564 --> 02:57:51,259
They have broken through!

1654
02:57:51,432 --> 02:57:53,696
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1655
02:57:53,868 --> 02:57:56,098
-Fall back!
-Retreat!

1656
02:57:56,204 --> 02:57:58,798
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1657
02:57:59,007 --> 02:58:01,237
Into the Keep!

1658
02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:15,680
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1659
02:58:15,859 --> 02:58:20,558
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1660
02:58:26,303 --> 02:58:27,565
Wait! Stop!

1661
02:58:28,471 --> 02:58:29,961
Stop!

1662
02:58:33,109 --> 02:58:34,804
Turn around.

1663
02:58:35,745 --> 02:58:38,441
-Turn around. Take us south.
-South?

1664
02:58:38,615 --> 02:58:43,609
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1665
02:58:43,954 --> 02:58:46,650
Yes. Exactly.

1666
02:58:46,823 --> 02:58:50,054
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1667
02:58:49,226 --> 02:58:51,888
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1668
02:58:52,063 --> 02:58:54,054
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1669
02:58:56,667 --> 02:58:59,693
That doesn't make sense to me.

1670
02:58:59,870 --> 02:59:01,030
But then. . .

1671
02:59:01,238 --> 02:59:03,900
. . .you are very small.

1672
02:59:04,408 --> 02:59:06,137
Perhaps you're right.

1673
02:59:08,813 --> 02:59:10,303
South it is, then.

1674
02:59:11,849 --> 02:59:15,182
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1675
02:59:15,221 --> 02:59:17,985
I always like going south.

1676
02:59:18,157 --> 02:59:22,457
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1677
02:59:23,062 --> 02:59:25,530
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1678
02:59:25,698 --> 02:59:27,632
No, we won't.

1679
02:59:28,368 --> 02:59:30,632
Not this time.

1680
02:59:37,310 --> 02:59:38,299
Look!

1681
02:59:39,979 --> 02:59:42,413
Osgiliath burns!

1682
02:59:42,582 --> 02:59:44,015
Mordor has come.

1683
02:59:45,151 --> 02:59:47,551
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1684
02:59:47,888 --> 02:59:50,083
It has only the power to destroy.

1685
02:59:50,924 --> 02:59:52,357
Please. . .

1686
02:59:52,526 --> 02:59:54,153
. . .let me go.

1687
02:59:55,195 --> 02:59:56,787
Hurry.

1688
03:00:00,267 --> 03:00:01,666
Faramir!

1689
03:00:01,835 --> 03:00:04,326
You must let me go!

1690
03:00:04,772 --> 03:00:08,230
And those little family of field mice. . .

1691
03:00:08,409 --> 03:00:11,242
. . .that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1692
03:00:11,979 --> 03:00:15,278
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they. . . .

1693
03:00:24,460 --> 03:00:27,395
Many of these trees were my friends.

1694
03:00:28,097 --> 03:00:32,727
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1695
03:00:33,903 --> 03:00:35,097
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1696
03:00:35,271 --> 03:00:38,035
They had voices of their own.

1697
03:00:40,309 --> 03:00:42,834
Saruman.

1698
03:00:43,212 --> 03:00:46,272
A wizard should know better!

1699
03:00:58,496 --> 03:01:02,125
There is no curse in Elvish. . .

1700
03:01:02,333 --> 03:01:04,995
. . . Entish or the tongues of Men. . .

1701
03:01:05,169 --> 03:01:07,501
. . .for this treachery.

1702
03:01:08,940 --> 03:01:11,773
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1703
03:01:16,481 --> 03:01:17,675
Where are they going?

1704
03:01:18,216 --> 03:01:21,447
They have business with the Orcs.

1705
03:01:21,919 --> 03:01:26,185
My business is with Isengard tonight. . .

1706
03:01:26,357 --> 03:01:28,985
. . .with rock and stone.

1707
03:01:50,884 --> 03:01:52,010
Yes.

1708
03:01:53,119 --> 03:01:54,552
Come, my friends.

1709
03:01:55,889 --> 03:02:00,087
The Ents are going to war.

1710
03:02:00,260 --> 03:02:02,023
It is likely. . .

1711
03:02:02,195 --> 03:02:05,722
. . .that we go to our doom.

1712
03:02:07,133 --> 03:02:09,601
Last march. . .

1713
03:02:10,136 --> 03:02:12,161
. . .of the Ents.

1714
03:02:58,286 --> 03:03:02,017
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1715
03:03:02,190 --> 03:03:04,249
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1716
03:03:07,028 --> 03:03:08,495
Mr. Frodo?

1717
03:03:08,797 --> 03:03:12,893
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1718
03:03:13,068 --> 03:03:15,559
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1719
03:03:28,918 --> 03:03:30,317
Take them to my father.

1720
03:03:31,887 --> 03:03:34,879
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1721
03:03:37,293 --> 03:03:40,319
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1722
03:03:41,430 --> 03:03:44,126
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1723
03:03:44,767 --> 03:03:47,531
You want to know
why your brother died?

1724
03:03:47,037 --> 03:03:50,768
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1725
03:03:50,974 --> 03:03:52,874
He tried to kill him!

1726
03:03:53,043 --> 03:03:55,375
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1727
03:03:56,146 --> 03:03:58,011
Watch out!

1728
03:04:07,925 --> 03:04:09,051
Mr. Frodo?

1729
03:04:11,696 --> 03:04:13,527
They're here.

1730
03:04:16,634 --> 03:04:19,102
They've come.

1731
03:04:21,706 --> 03:04:23,606
Nazgûl!

1732
03:04:45,663 --> 03:04:47,824
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1733
03:04:49,634 --> 03:04:51,864
Take cover!

1734
03:05:06,220 --> 03:05:07,778
The fortress is taken.

1735
03:05:08,556 --> 03:05:09,750
It is over.

1736
03:05:09,924 --> 03:05:13,860
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1737
03:05:14,028 --> 03:05:16,963
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1738
03:05:19,700 --> 03:05:21,099
They're breaking in!

1739
03:05:23,738 --> 03:05:26,229
They're past the door!

1740
03:05:29,610 --> 03:05:33,740
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1741
03:05:36,350 --> 03:05:38,284
Is there no other way?

1742
03:05:39,854 --> 03:05:42,914
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1743
03:05:43,591 --> 03:05:45,786
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1744
03:05:48,664 --> 03:05:51,064
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1745
03:05:51,234 --> 03:05:54,101
-And barricade the entrance!
-So much death.

1746
03:05:56,305 --> 03:05:59,706
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1747
03:06:04,380 --> 03:06:05,813
Ride out with me.

1748
03:06:09,919 --> 03:06:11,546
Ride out and meet them.

1749
03:06:12,321 --> 03:06:14,482
For death and glory.

1750
03:06:14,657 --> 03:06:16,056
For Rohan.

1751
03:06:17,560 --> 03:06:19,027
For your people.

1752
03:06:19,762 --> 03:06:21,696
The sun is rising.

1753
03:06:25,202 --> 03:06:28,194
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

1754
03:06:28,372 --> 03:06:29,771
At dawn. . .

1755
03:06:29,973 --> 03:06:31,634
. . . look to the east.

1756
03:06:35,813 --> 03:06:37,440
Yes.

1757
03:06:39,917 --> 03:06:41,578
Yes.

1758
03:06:42,920 --> 03:06:45,320
The horn of Helm Hammerhand. . .

1759
03:06:45,489 --> 03:06:48,287
. . .shall sound in the Deep. . .

1760
03:06:47,725 --> 03:06:49,716
. . .one last time.

1761
03:06:49,894 --> 03:06:51,384
Yes!

1762
03:06:54,432 --> 03:06:58,232
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1763
03:07:06,044 --> 03:07:07,375
Fell deeds, awake.

1764
03:07:08,580 --> 03:07:09,638
Now for wrath. . .

1765
03:07:09,848 --> 03:07:13,249
. . . now for ruin and a red dawn.

1766
03:07:18,291 --> 03:07:20,555
Forth Eorlingas!

1767
03:08:08,341 --> 03:08:09,535
Gandalf.

1768
03:08:13,850 --> 03:08:17,513
Théoden King stands alone.

1769
03:08:18,121 --> 03:08:20,282
Not alone.

1770
03:08:20,690 --> 03:08:21,816
Rohirrim!

1771
03:08:27,730 --> 03:08:28,890
Éomer.

1772
03:08:29,065 --> 03:08:31,590
To the king!

1773
03:09:46,245 --> 03:09:48,008
Yes!

1774
03:09:57,156 --> 03:10:00,592
A hit. A fine hit.

1775
03:10:23,117 --> 03:10:25,585
Break the dam!

1776
03:10:25,753 --> 03:10:29,189
Release the river!

1777
03:10:56,551 --> 03:10:59,281
Pippin! Hold on!

1778
03:11:03,559 --> 03:11:06,494
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1779
03:11:45,803 --> 03:11:47,828
What are you doing?

1780
03:11:56,447 --> 03:11:57,971
Where are you going?

1781
03:12:53,173 --> 03:12:54,470
It's me.

1782
03:12:57,010 --> 03:12:59,205
It's your Sam.

1783
03:13:03,550 --> 03:13:06,178
Don't you know your Sam?

1784
03:13:23,837 --> 03:13:27,204
I can't do this, Sam.

1785
03:13:27,141 --> 03:13:29,109
I know.

1786
03:13:30,144 --> 03:13:32,510
It's all wrong.

1787
03:13:33,248 --> 03:13:35,273
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1788
03:13:42,690 --> 03:13:44,783
But we are.

1789
03:13:50,199 --> 03:13:53,225
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1790
03:13:53,402 --> 03:13:55,802
The ones that really mattered.

1791
03:13:56,839 --> 03:13:59,831
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1792
03:14:00,042 --> 03:14:03,011
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end. . .

1793
03:14:03,178 --> 03:14:06,113
. . .because how could the end be happy?

1794
03:14:08,684 --> 03:14:10,879
How could the world go back
to the way it was. . .

1795
03:14:11,053 --> 03:14:14,489
. . . when so much bad had happened?

1796
03:14:15,324 --> 03:14:17,224
Victory!

1797
03:14:17,393 --> 03:14:18,951
We have victory!

1798
03:14:19,128 --> 03:14:23,064
But in the end,
It's only a passing thing. . .

1799
03:14:23,232 --> 03:14:24,563
. . . this shadow.

1800
03:14:24,733 --> 03:14:27,133
Even darkness must pass.

1801
03:14:27,303 --> 03:14:29,999
A new day will come.

1802
03:14:30,205 --> 03:14:34,141
And when the sun shines,
It will shine out the clearer.

1803
03:14:35,078 --> 03:14:37,444
Those were the stories
that stayed with you. . .

1804
03:14:37,614 --> 03:14:39,377
. . . that meant something.

1805
03:14:39,549 --> 03:14:42,109
Even If you were too small
to understand why.

1806
03:14:43,486 --> 03:14:47,354
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1807
03:14:46,524 --> 03:14:48,082
I know now.

1808
03:14:48,926 --> 03:14:51,121
Folk in those stories. . .

1809
03:14:51,295 --> 03:14:55,425
. . . had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1810
03:14:55,599 --> 03:14:57,829
They kept going. . .

1811
03:14:58,502 --> 03:15:01,767
. . .because they were holding
on to something.

1812
03:15:02,407 --> 03:15:04,705
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1813
03:15:16,588 --> 03:15:20,524
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1814
03:15:19,792 --> 03:15:22,420
And it's worth fighting for.

1815
03:15:48,355 --> 03:15:52,655
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1816
03:15:53,394 --> 03:15:57,353
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1817
03:15:57,531 --> 03:15:59,726
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1818
03:16:04,104 --> 03:16:05,503
Then it is forfeit.

1819
03:16:07,275 --> 03:16:08,970
Release them.

1820
03:16:21,056 --> 03:16:23,115
Stay out of the forest!

1821
03:16:23,291 --> 03:16:25,088
Keep away from the trees!

1822
03:17:13,910 --> 03:17:15,707
Final count. . .

1823
03:17:15,879 --> 03:17:18,780
-. . .42.
-Forty-two?

1824
03:17:20,250 --> 03:17:25,017
That's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

1825
03:17:25,822 --> 03:17:29,485
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1826
03:17:32,597 --> 03:17:35,896
-Forty-three.
-He was already dead.

1827
03:17:36,667 --> 03:17:39,158
-He was twitching.
-He was twitching. . .

1828
03:17:39,337 --> 03:17:44,036
. . .because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

1829
03:17:46,277 --> 03:17:50,976
-He doesn't look too happy, does he?
-Not too happy at all, Merry.

1830
03:17:50,249 --> 03:17:53,776
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

1831
03:17:53,952 --> 03:17:56,921
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1832
03:17:57,089 --> 03:17:59,922
I hear the staff are very good.

1833
03:18:05,597 --> 03:18:07,963
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

1834
03:18:08,133 --> 03:18:12,399
-The world is back to normal, that's all.
-No, it isn't.

1835
03:18:12,571 --> 03:18:13,799
I'm starving.

1836
03:18:14,006 --> 03:18:17,066
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

1837
03:18:15,276 --> 03:18:18,302
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1838
03:18:41,303 --> 03:18:43,703
Saruman's storeroom!

1839
03:18:46,074 --> 03:18:48,770
I don't believe it.

1840
03:18:48,977 --> 03:18:51,002
It can't be.

1841
03:18:51,646 --> 03:18:54,547
-It is!
-Longbottom Leaf.

1842
03:18:55,850 --> 03:18:58,148
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1843
03:18:58,520 --> 03:19:01,546
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1844
03:19:01,723 --> 03:19:02,849
Wait.

1845
03:19:03,592 --> 03:19:04,820
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

1846
03:19:04,993 --> 03:19:06,517
Share it?

1847
03:19:08,363 --> 03:19:10,763
No. No.

1848
03:19:12,267 --> 03:19:13,598
Dead plant and all that.

1849
03:19:14,035 --> 03:19:16,196
Don't think he'd understand.

1850
03:19:17,505 --> 03:19:19,666
Could be a distant relative.

1851
03:19:19,475 --> 03:19:21,966
I get it.

1852
03:19:22,178 --> 03:19:24,976
Don't be hasty.

1853
03:19:26,082 --> 03:19:27,845
Exactly.

1854
03:19:28,918 --> 03:19:31,182
Bar-hrum.

1855
03:19:54,846 --> 03:19:56,143
This is the old sewer.

1856
03:19:56,314 --> 03:19:59,374
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1857
03:19:59,550 --> 03:20:01,279
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1858
03:20:02,353 --> 03:20:04,821
Captain Faramir. . .

1859
03:20:05,456 --> 03:20:07,287
. . .you have shown your quality, sir.

1860
03:20:09,794 --> 03:20:11,091
The very highest.

1861
03:20:11,596 --> 03:20:14,224
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee. . .

1862
03:20:14,399 --> 03:20:17,334
. . .where gardeners are held in high honor.

1863
03:20:18,536 --> 03:20:20,504
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1864
03:20:21,139 --> 03:20:22,663
Gollum says there's a path. . .

1865
03:20:22,874 --> 03:20:26,810
. . . near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

1866
03:20:27,278 --> 03:20:29,007
Cirith Ungol?

1867
03:20:31,550 --> 03:20:34,110
-Is that its name?
-No.

1868
03:20:34,286 --> 03:20:35,947
No!

1869
03:20:36,789 --> 03:20:39,781
-Yes.
-Frodo. . .

1870
03:20:40,159 --> 03:20:43,686
. . .they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1871
03:20:43,596 --> 03:20:46,121
-You cannot go that way.
-It is the only way.

1872
03:20:46,466 --> 03:20:52,735
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

1873
03:20:54,274 --> 03:20:56,037
I must.

1874
03:20:59,579 --> 03:21:03,140
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1875
03:21:03,316 --> 03:21:05,341
Thank you.

1876
03:21:16,163 --> 03:21:20,293
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

1877
03:21:32,780 --> 03:21:34,304
Come on, keep up.

1878
03:21:37,785 --> 03:21:40,583
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

1879
03:21:41,222 --> 03:21:43,053
You know that, don't you?

1880
03:21:43,858 --> 03:21:45,416
He was trying to save you, see?

1881
03:21:45,926 --> 03:21:47,450
Save me?

1882
03:21:47,795 --> 03:21:49,956
So there's no hard feelings.

1883
03:21:50,131 --> 03:21:55,194
-Forgive and forget.
-No, no, no hard feelings.

1884
03:21:55,369 --> 03:21:57,997
Gollum, Gollum.

1885
03:21:59,073 --> 03:22:00,802
Yes, master.

1886
03:21:59,909 --> 03:22:02,742
-Nice Hobbits.
-Very decent of you.

1887
03:22:02,912 --> 03:22:05,210
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

1888
03:22:10,720 --> 03:22:15,919
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1889
03:22:22,065 --> 03:22:25,057
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1890
03:22:25,736 --> 03:22:29,263
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1891
03:22:34,445 --> 03:22:37,881
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits. . .

1892
03:22:38,849 --> 03:22:42,080
. . . somewhere in the wilderness.

1893
03:22:44,389 --> 03:22:47,790
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1894
03:22:47,959 --> 03:22:49,324
What?

1895
03:22:49,494 --> 03:22:53,396
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

1896
03:22:53,565 --> 03:22:56,830
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1897
03:22:57,001 --> 03:22:59,936
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1898
03:23:00,104 --> 03:23:01,765
"Yes, my boy.

1899
03:23:01,973 --> 03:23:05,773
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot"

1900
03:23:05,944 --> 03:23:08,435
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1901
03:23:08,646 --> 03:23:10,546
"Samwise the Brave"

1902
03:23:10,715 --> 03:23:13,445
I want to hear more about Sam.

1903
03:23:16,755 --> 03:23:19,747
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1904
03:23:21,093 --> 03:23:25,120
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1905
03:23:26,232 --> 03:23:27,597
So was I.

1906
03:23:35,509 --> 03:23:38,171
"Samwise the Brave"

1907
03:23:42,482 --> 03:23:43,813
Sméagol?

1908
03:23:43,984 --> 03:23:46,885
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

1909
03:23:47,053 --> 03:23:48,987
Master.

1910
03:23:49,155 --> 03:23:52,056
Master looks after us.

1911
03:23:52,826 --> 03:23:55,624
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1912
03:23:55,795 --> 03:23:58,263
Master broke his promise.

1913
03:23:58,431 --> 03:24:00,592
Don't ask Sméagol.

1914
03:24:00,767 --> 03:24:03,964
Poor, poor Sméagol.

1915
03:24:04,137 --> 03:24:06,970
Master betrayed us.

1916
03:24:07,173 --> 03:24:10,233
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1917
03:24:10,443 --> 03:24:14,345
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1918
03:24:14,514 --> 03:24:17,244
Kill him! Kill him!

1919
03:24:16,417 --> 03:24:17,907
Kill them both!

1920
03:24:18,085 --> 03:24:21,714
And then we take the precious. . .

1921
03:24:21,889 --> 03:24:25,416
. . .and we be the master!

1922
03:24:26,093 --> 03:24:28,755
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1923
03:24:28,930 --> 03:24:31,592
Eyes always watching.

1924
03:24:31,766 --> 03:24:35,327
Then we stabs them out.

1925
03:24:35,503 --> 03:24:39,997
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

1926
03:24:39,207 --> 03:24:42,643
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1927
03:24:42,844 --> 03:24:45,540
Kill them both.

1928
03:24:45,714 --> 03:24:48,114
Yes. No! No!

1929
03:24:48,317 --> 03:24:52,014
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1930
03:24:52,721 --> 03:24:55,315
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1931
03:24:55,490 --> 03:24:58,084
-Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
-Sméagol?

1932
03:24:58,260 --> 03:25:03,664
We could let her do it.

1933
03:25:03,633 --> 03:25:07,763
Yes. She could do it.

1934
03:25:07,937 --> 03:25:12,499
Yes, precious, she could.

1935
03:25:12,709 --> 03:25:18,705
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1936
03:25:18,682 --> 03:25:21,515
Once they're dead.

1937
03:25:25,923 --> 03:25:29,620
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1938
03:25:29,793 --> 03:25:31,852
Sméagol will show you the way.

1939
03:25:32,029 --> 03:25:34,259
Follow me.

1940
03:25:37,429 --> 03:25:45,629
ma3 tahyat 'Don camello'
and 'Tarek badra'

1941
03:25:46,313 --> 03:25:56,013
