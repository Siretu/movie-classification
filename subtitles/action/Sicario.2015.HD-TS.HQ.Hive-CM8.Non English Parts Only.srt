assassins that hunted the Romans, invaders of their tierra

3
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:16,877

How is the wife?

23
00:41:06,287 --> 00:41:09,393
We had two sons
10 and 8 years old

24
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:15,973
In Juarez?

Don't Know.

59
00:56:33,772 --> 00:56:35,958
You can't cross for "las pajaritas"

60
00:56:36,158 --> 00:56:37,809
No you can't there.

61
00:56:38,009 --> 00:56:40,127

Look,look...This is drug's Land

66
00:56:58,511 --> 00:57:02,972
The only persons that cross here.
Are the "mules" and the "pollos"

67
00:57:03,172 --> 00:57:06,564
And they do it to keep immigration 
away from their tunnels

68
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:09,178
You never cross where they have their tunnels,Right

From here you can walk to the 86.

72
00:57:18,486 --> 00:57:21,069

76
00:57:39,227 --> 00:57:40,412
