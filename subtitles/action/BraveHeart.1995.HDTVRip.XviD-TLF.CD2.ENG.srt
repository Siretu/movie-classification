1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:03,266
- Father.
- Ah, come in. Come in.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,433
A rebellion has begun.

3
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:17,446
- Under whom?
- A commoner... named William Wallace.

4
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:30,562
You will embrace this rebellion.

5
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,499
Support it from our lands in the North.

6
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,003
I will gain English favor by condemning it

7
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,576
and ordering it opposed
from our lands in the South.

8
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,175
Sit down. Stay awhile.

9
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:55,214
This Wallace...

10
00:00:56,392 --> 00:01:00,590
He doesn't even have a knighthood.
But he fights with passion.

11
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:02,721
And he inspires!

12
00:01:02,798 --> 00:01:05,892
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did?

13
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,596
- So would I.
- Well, maybe it's time.

14
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:13,971
It is time... to survive.

15
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:17,103
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

16
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:23,049
The 16 before you passed you land and title
because they didn't charge in.

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,419
- Call a meeting of the nobles.
- They do nothing but talk.

18
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:33,461
Rightly so. They're as rich in English titles
and lands as they are in Scottish, as we are.

19
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:36,963
You admire this man... this William Wallace.

20
00:01:37,032 --> 00:01:39,660
Uncompromising men are easier to admire.

21
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:42,202
He has courage. So does a dog.

22
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:46,867
But it is exactly the ability to compromise
that makes a man noble.

23
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,835
And understand this:

24
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:54,348
Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king
ever to sit on the throne of England.

25
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,680
And none of us

26
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:59,879
and nothing of Scotland will remain

27
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,048
unless we are as ruthless.

28
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,552
Give ear to our nobles.

29
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:08,821
Knowing their minds

30
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:10,991
is the key to the throne.

31
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:30,048
Wait. Look.

32
00:02:30,986 --> 00:02:33,045
This is out and this is left.

33
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:35,715
Carry on.

34
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:23,158
You know, eventually,
Longshanks will send in his northern army.

35
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:27,328
Heavy cavalry. Armored horse.
Shake the very ground.

36
00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:33,565
- He'll ride right over us.
- Uncle Argyle used to talk about it.

37
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:37,105
How no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

38
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:40,706
- So what do we do?
- Hit. Run. Hide. The Highland way.

39
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:51,118
Or make spears.

40
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,054
Hundreds of 'em.
Long spears. Twice as long as a man.

41
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,860
- That long?
- Aye.

42
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:01,427
Some men are longer than others.

43
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:04,768
Your mother been telling you
stories about me again?

44
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:08,203
Volunteers coming in.

45
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,646
William Wallace.
We've come to fight and to die for you.

46
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:17,810
Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

47
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,850
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

48
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:24,592
- I brought you this...
- We checked them for arms.

49
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:28,054
I brought you this.

50
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:30,495
- My wife made it for you.
- Thank you.

51
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:38,065
Him! That can't be William Wallace.

52
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,232
I'm prettier than this man.

53
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:46,176
All right, Father. I'll ask him.

54
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:52,046
If I risk my neck for you,

55
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:54,214
will I get to kill Englishmen?

56
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:57,781
Is your father a ghost
or do you converse with the Almighty?

57
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,057
To find his equal,
an Irishman is forced to talk to God.

58
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,620
Yes, Father.

59
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:06,190
The Almighty says,
"Just answer the fucking question!"

60
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:08,293
- Mind your tongue.
- Insane Irish!

61
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:16,639
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

62
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,703
That's my friend, Irishman.

63
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:23,478
And the answer to your question is yes.
Fight for me, you get to kill the English.

64
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:25,753
Excellent.

65
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:28,514
Stephen is my name.

66
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:30,956
I'm the most wanted man on my island.

67
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:33,527
Except I'm not on my island, of course.

68
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,063
- More's the pity.
- Your island?

69
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:39,157
- You mean Ireland?
- Yeah. It's mine.

70
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:46,131
You're a madman.

71
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:54,973
I've come to the right place, then.

72
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:18,998
Sure, didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

73
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:22,729
I didn't like him anyway.

74
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:27,066
He wasn't right in the head.

75
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:43,088
William. It's our runners.

76
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:58,034
The English... are advancing
an army towards Stirling.

77
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:02,475
- Do the nobles rally?
- Robert the Bruce and others will not fight.

78
00:09:02,577 --> 00:09:06,104
But word has spread. The Highlanders
are coming down on their own.

79
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:09,479
Aye... In droves of hundreds...
and thousands!

80
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:11,677
Are you ready for a war?

81
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:30,728
- What news?
- We're outnumbered, at least three to one.

82
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,137
- How many horse, then?
- 300, maybe more.

83
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:36,210
- 300 heavy horse!
- We must try to negotiate.

84
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:40,044
Who was in command?
Did he have a scarlet chevron?

85
00:09:40,115 --> 00:09:42,640
- Aye, he did.
- That'll be Cheltham.

86
00:09:42,718 --> 00:09:44,811
We could still negotiate...

87
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:50,917
What are they talking about?

88
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:53,688
I can't hear, but it doesn't look good.

89
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:55,855
The nobles will negotiate.

90
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:59,128
They do a deal... and we go home.

91
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:01,828
If not... we charge.

92
00:10:01,903 --> 00:10:04,667
300 heavy horse. We've no chance.

93
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:04,989
So many.

94
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:13,204
I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.

95
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:15,367
Then I'd have to work for them.

96
00:11:15,444 --> 00:11:17,571
Nor me.

97
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:21,712
All right, lads.
I'm not dying for these bastards.

98
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:24,779
Let's go home.

99
00:11:41,636 --> 00:11:43,934
Stop, men!

100
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:48,032
Do not flee. Wait until we've negotiated.

101
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:44,595
- William Wallace!
- Can't be. Not tall enough.

102
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,116
The Almighty says this is a fashionable fight.
It's drawn the finest people.

103
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:15,663
- Where is thy salute?
- For coming to this battlefield, I thank you.

104
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,824
This is our army. To join it, you give homage.

105
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,300
I give homage to Scotland.

106
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:23,701
And if this is your army,

107
00:13:25,073 --> 00:13:26,665
why does it go?

108
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:29,039
We didn't come here to fight for them.

109
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:35,515
Home. The English are too many.

110
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:49,128
Sons of Scotland! I am William Wallace!

111
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:52,894
- William Wallace is seven feet tall.
- Yes, I've heard.

112
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:55,695
He kills men by the hundred.

113
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:00,104
And if he were here, he'd consume
the English with fireballs from his eyes

114
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:02,268
and lightning from his arse.

115
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:08,407
I am William Wallace!

116
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:14,421
And I see a whole army of my countrymen

117
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,820
here in defiance of tyranny.

118
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:22,755
You've come to fight as free men

119
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,958
and free men you are!

120
00:14:29,838 --> 00:14:32,329
What will you do without freedom?

121
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:36,535
Will you fight?

122
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:42,006
Against that? No.

123
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:44,210
We will run, and we will live.

124
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:47,813
Aye. Fight and you may die.

125
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:50,816
Run, and you'll live.

126
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:54,556
At least a while.

127
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:59,996
And dying in your beds,
many years from now,

128
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:03,634
would you be willing to trade

129
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:06,605
all the days from this day to that

130
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:09,371
for one chance, just one chance,

131
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:12,277
to come back here and tell our enemies

132
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,644
that they may take our lives

133
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:18,949
but they'll never take our freedom!

134
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:49,211
They seem quite optimistic.
Maybe they do want to fight.

135
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:52,219
Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion.

136
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:56,456
Nonetheless, we should
deliver the King's terms.

137
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:59,652
The King's terms?
They'll never live up to them.

138
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:01,591
My Lord, I think...

139
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:03,824
All right. Offer them the terms.

140
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:11,329
- They're coming out. Should we go to them?
- Let me do the talking. Agreed?

141
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:12,667
Aye.

142
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:19,638
Fine speech.

143
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:22,507
Now what do we do?

144
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:25,845
Just be yourselves.

145
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:30,085
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to pick a fight.

146
00:16:36,364 --> 00:16:39,697
Well, we didn't get dressed up for nothing.

147
00:16:42,437 --> 00:16:44,462
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

148
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:51,536
Here are the King's terms.

149
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:55,138
Lead this army off the field

150
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:02,054
and he will give you each estates in Yorkshire

151
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:07,150
including hereditary title,
from which you will pay...

152
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,328
- From which you will pay...
- I have an offer for ye.

153
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:14,391
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

154
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:18,196
From which you will pay the King...

155
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:21,571
- I said I have an offer.
- You disrespect a banner of truce.

156
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:23,576
From his King? Absolutely.

157
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:30,679
Here are Scotland's terms. Lower your flags
and march straight back to England.

158
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:36,019
At every home you pass, beg forgiveness
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

159
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,355
Do that, and your men shall live.

160
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:43,354
Do it not and every one of you will die today.

161
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:53,969
You are outmatched.
You have no heavy cavalry.

162
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:56,840
In two centuries, no army has won without...

163
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,936
I'm not finished!

164
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:02,607
Before we let you leave

165
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:07,745
your commander must cross that field,
present himself before this army,

166
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:11,319
put his head between his legs
and kiss his own arse.

167
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:25,238
That was less cordial than he was used to.

168
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,639
You be ready and do exactly as I say.
On my signal

169
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:31,803
ride round behind our position,
and flank them.

170
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:36,383
- We must not divide our forces.
- Do it... and let the English see you do it.

171
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,678
They'll think we run away?

172
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:42,415
Take out their archers and meet in the middle.

173
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:45,050
Right. Come on.

174
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:12,714
Insolent bastard.
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate!

175
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:15,179
Archers.

176
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:26,828
Archers forward.

177
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:24,788
You bastards.

178
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,155
Loose.

179
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:25,642
The Lord tells me He can get me out of
this mess but He's pretty sure you're fucked.

180
00:21:46,774 --> 00:21:48,742
Ready... Loose.

181
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:08,418
Ride.

182
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:15,163
See? Every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

183
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:19,570
Our cavalry will ride them down like grass.
Send the horse.

184
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:22,069
Full attack.

185
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:38,346
Steady...

186
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:40,918
Hold.

187
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,548
Hold.

188
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,388
Hold.

189
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:56,766
Hold.

190
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:10,780
Now!

191
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,762
- Send the infantry.
- My Lord...

192
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,061
You lead them.

193
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:16,649
Charge.

194
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:21,000
Retreat.

195
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,739
Bastard.

196
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,974
Come on.

197
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,015
All right.

198
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,914
Wallace.

199
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:22,459
Wallace.

200
00:29:54,895 --> 00:29:56,954
I knight thee

201
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,123
Sir William Wallace.

202
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,363
Sir William, in the name of God

203
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:08,839
we appoint thee guardian
and high protector of Scotland

204
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:11,673
and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

205
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,538
Stand and be recognized.

206
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:28,494
Does anyone know his politics?

207
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:32,362
No, but his weight with the commoners
could upset everything.

208
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:35,264
The Balliols will kiss his arse,
and so we must.

209
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:45,168
Sir William.

210
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:54,976
Inasmuch as you and your captains
hail from a region

211
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:58,149
long known to support the Balliol clan,

212
00:30:58,225 --> 00:31:03,322
may we invite you to continue your support
and uphold our rightful claim?

213
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:07,400
Damn the Balliol clan.
They're all Longshanks's men.

214
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:10,927
Gentlemen.

215
00:31:12,006 --> 00:31:14,304
- Gentlemen.
- It's time to declare a king.

216
00:31:14,408 --> 00:31:18,606
Halt. Wait. Are you prepared
to recognize our legitimate succession?

217
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:22,443
- You won't support the claim.
- Those were lies, written by you.

218
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,744
Oh, no.

219
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:30,415
- I demand recognition of these documents.
- These were lies when you wrote them.

220
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:33,256
Please, gentlemen.

221
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:38,224
Quiet. Sir William. Where are you going?

222
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:42,265
We have beaten the English.

223
00:31:42,803 --> 00:31:46,466
But they'll come back
because you won't stand together.

224
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,867
- What will you do?
- I will invade England

225
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:54,038
and defeat the English on their own ground.

226
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,343
Invade? That's impossible.

227
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:01,047
Why? Why is that impossible?

228
00:32:02,056 --> 00:32:06,823
You're so concerned with squabbling
for the scraps from Longshanks's table

229
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:10,887
that you've missed
your God-given right to something better.

230
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:13,057
There's a difference between us.

231
00:32:13,701 --> 00:32:18,001
You think the people of Scotland exist
to provide you with position.

232
00:32:18,072 --> 00:32:22,475
I think your position exists
to provide those people with freedom.

233
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:25,877
And I go to make sure that they have it.

234
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:41,186
Wait.

235
00:32:44,265 --> 00:32:48,895
I respect what you said. But remember
that these men have lands and castles.

236
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:50,903
It's much to risk.

237
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:54,736
And the common man that bleeds
in battle, does he risk less?

238
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:04,716
No. But from top to bottom,
this country has got no sense of itself.

239
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:08,015
Its nobles share allegiance with England.

240
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:10,420
- Its clans war with each other.
- Aye.

241
00:33:12,693 --> 00:33:16,561
If you make enemies on both sides
of the border, you'll end up dead.

242
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:21,567
- We all will. It's a question of how and why.
- I'm not a coward. I want what you want.

243
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:23,466
But we need the nobles.

244
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:25,937
- We need 'em?
- Aye.

245
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:29,767
What does that mean, to be noble?

246
00:33:29,877 --> 00:33:34,905
Your title gives you claim to Scotland's
throne, but men don't follow titles.

247
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,908
They follow courage.

248
00:33:37,985 --> 00:33:41,250
Our people know you.
Noble and common, they respect you.

249
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:44,984
And if you would just lead them to freedom...

250
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:49,587
they'd follow you.

251
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,325
And so would I.

252
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:19,223
Damn it. My sodomite cousin the Prince
tells me he has no troops to lend.

253
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,488
Every town in northern England
is begging for help.

254
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,091
He advances.

255
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:27,360
- To which town?
- To here, my Lord.

256
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:33,130
Bring the provisions inside,
double the guards, seal the gate. Now.

257
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:35,505
Quickly. Bring in the provisions.

258
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,535
Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.

259
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:12,067
I will not tell my uncle I've lost him
the greatest city in the North.

260
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,887
Come on.

261
00:36:29,556 --> 00:36:31,649
Make way for the King.

262
00:36:40,768 --> 00:36:42,861
It's not your fault.

263
00:36:43,737 --> 00:36:46,865
- Stand up to him.
- I will stand up to him and more.

264
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:27,512
What news of the North?

265
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:32,282
Nothing new, Your Majesty.
We've sent riders to speed any word.

266
00:37:33,187 --> 00:37:37,817
I heard the word in France where I was
fighting to expand your future kingdom.

267
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:43,957
The word, my son, is that
our entire northern army is annihilated.

268
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:47,997
And you have done nothing.

269
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:52,162
I... have ordered conscription, sir,
assembled and ready to depart.

270
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:58,609
Excuse me, sire, but there's
a very urgent message from York.

271
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:00,771
Come.

272
00:38:08,422 --> 00:38:10,549
- Leave us.
- Thank you, sire.

273
00:38:13,927 --> 00:38:16,760
- Wallace has sacked York.
- What?

274
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,923
Wallace has sacked York.

275
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:37,241
Sire... thy own nephew.

276
00:38:38,418 --> 00:38:41,410
What beast could do such a thing.

277
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:44,682
If he can sack York

278
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:49,555
he can invade Lower England.

279
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,359
We will stop him.

280
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:57,897
Who is this person who speaks to me
as though I needed his advice?

281
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:03,873
- I have declared Phillip my High Counsellor.
- Is he qualified?

282
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:08,245
I am skilled in the arts of war
and military tactics, sire.

283
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:11,642
Are you?

284
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:13,243
Tell me...

285
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,622
What advice would you offer
on the present... situation?

286
00:39:49,756 --> 00:39:51,849
I shall offer a truce

287
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:55,486
and buy him off.

288
00:39:57,364 --> 00:40:00,925
But who will go to him? Not I.

289
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:04,364
If I fell under the sword of that murderer

290
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:07,565
it might be my head in a basket.

291
00:40:08,642 --> 00:40:12,043
And not... my gentle son.

292
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:16,913
The mere sight of him would only encourage
an enemy to take over the whole country.

293
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:22,346
So whom do I send?

294
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:28,183
Whom do I send?

295
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:53,996
I'm dreaming.

296
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:56,165
Yes, you are.

297
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,434
And you must wake.

298
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,045
I don't want to wake.

299
00:42:11,222 --> 00:42:13,281
I want to stay here with you.

300
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:16,918
And I with you.

301
00:42:17,695 --> 00:42:19,788
But you must wake now.

302
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:24,926
Wake up, William.

303
00:42:25,236 --> 00:42:27,295
Wake up.

304
00:42:28,506 --> 00:42:30,736
William, wake up...

305
00:42:31,276 --> 00:42:34,336
William. A royal entourage comes

306
00:42:34,445 --> 00:42:36,504
flying banners of truce

307
00:42:36,614 --> 00:42:39,276
and the standards of Longshanks himself.

308
00:43:22,393 --> 00:43:24,486
I am the Princess of Wales.

309
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:28,089
I come as the King's servant
and with his authority.

310
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:31,326
To do what?

311
00:43:31,736 --> 00:43:33,897
To discuss the King's proposals.

312
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,799
Will you speak with a woman?

313
00:43:58,563 --> 00:44:01,293
I hear you have been given the rank of knight.

314
00:44:01,366 --> 00:44:03,425
I have been given nothing.

315
00:44:04,302 --> 00:44:06,361
God makes men what they are.

316
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:09,406
God made you the sacker of peaceful cities?

317
00:44:09,507 --> 00:44:14,137
The executioner of the King's nephew,
my husband's own cousin?

318
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:18,446
York was the staging point
for every invasion of my country.

319
00:44:19,617 --> 00:44:24,782
That cousin hanged innocent Scots, even
women and children, from the city walls.

320
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:31,353
Longshanks did far worse
the last time he took a Scottish city.

321
00:44:47,578 --> 00:44:49,739
Or in French if you prefer?

322
00:44:51,682 --> 00:44:54,549
You ask your King... to his face. Ask him.

323
00:44:57,555 --> 00:45:00,251
See if his eyes can convince you of the truth.

324
00:45:08,866 --> 00:45:10,959
Hamilton... Leave us.

325
00:45:12,904 --> 00:45:15,668
- My Lady?
- Leave us. Now.

326
00:45:27,485 --> 00:45:29,419
Let us talk plainly.

327
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:31,682
You invade England.

328
00:45:31,823 --> 00:45:36,317
But you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your shelter and supply.

329
00:45:37,662 --> 00:45:39,721
The King desires peace.

330
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:44,627
- Longshanks desires peace?
- He declares it to me, I swear it.

331
00:45:44,702 --> 00:45:47,262
He proposes that you withdraw your attack.

332
00:45:47,338 --> 00:45:50,899
In return he grants you title,
estates and this chest of gold

333
00:45:51,008 --> 00:45:53,033
which I am to pay to you personally.

334
00:45:54,445 --> 00:45:58,541
A lordship and titles, gold...
that I should become Judas.

335
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:02,649
- Peace is made in such ways.
- Slaves are made in such ways.

336
00:46:05,957 --> 00:46:09,290
The last time Longshanks spoke of peace,
I was a boy.

337
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,158
Many Scottish nobles
who would not be slaves,

338
00:46:12,263 --> 00:46:15,562
were lured by him,
under a flag of truce, to a barn...

339
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:18,427
where he had them hanged.

340
00:46:19,036 --> 00:46:24,099
I was very young, but I remember
Longshanks's notion of peace.

341
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:30,545
I understand you have suffered.

342
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:34,984
I know... about your woman.

343
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:48,156
She was my wife.

344
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:55,734
We married in secret because I would
not share her with an English lord.

345
00:46:56,173 --> 00:46:59,506
They killed her... to get to me.

346
00:47:04,415 --> 00:47:06,508
I've never spoken of it.

347
00:47:08,185 --> 00:47:10,983
I don't know why I tell you now, except...

348
00:47:14,325 --> 00:47:16,384
I see her strength in you.

349
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,392
One day, you'll be a queen.

350
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:29,364
And you must open your eyes.

351
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,439
You tell your King

352
00:47:39,016 --> 00:47:43,919
that William Wallace will not be ruled
and nor will any Scot while I live.
