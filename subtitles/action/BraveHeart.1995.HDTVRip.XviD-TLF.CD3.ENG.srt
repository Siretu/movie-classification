1
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:29,110
Ah. My son's loyal wife returns
unkilled by the heathen.

2
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:32,580
- So he accepted our bribe?
- No. He did not.

3
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:36,277
Then why does he stay?

4
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:39,254
My scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

5
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:41,450
He waits for you at York.

6
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:46,588
He says he will attack no more towns
if you are man enough to come and face him.

7
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:49,324
Did he?

8
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,527
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected

9
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:58,132
arriving so far around his flank.

10
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:01,911
The main force of our armies
from France land here

11
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,140
to the north of Edinburgh.

12
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:08,548
Conscripts from Ireland
will approach from the southwest...

13
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:10,210
to here.

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,881
Welsh bowmen, troops from France,
Irish conscripts.

15
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:16,721
But they'd take weeks to assemble.

16
00:01:17,628 --> 00:01:21,155
I dispatched them... before I sent your wife.

17
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:29,963
So our little ruse succeeded. Thank you.

18
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,306
And while this upstart
awaits my arrival in York,

19
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:38,337
my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh, behind him.

20
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,383
You spoke with this...

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,118
Wallace in private?

22
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,651
Tell me...

23
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,353
What kind of man is he?

24
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,723
A mindless barbarian.

25
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,559
Not a king like you, my Lord.

26
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,529
You may return to your embroidery.

27
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:06,233
Humbly, my Lord.

28
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,402
You brought back the money?

29
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:17,016
No. I gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war.

30
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,956
That's what happens
when you send a woman.

31
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:25,857
Forgive me, sire.

32
00:02:25,963 --> 00:02:31,265
I thought that generosity might demonstrate
your greatness to those you mean to rule.

33
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:36,998
My greatness

34
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,771
will be better demonstrated
when Wallace returns to Scotland

35
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:43,312
and finds his country in ashes.

36
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,118
William.

37
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,415
There's riders approaching.

38
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:01,890
A personal escort of the Princess.

39
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,525
Aye.

40
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:06,930
Must have made an impression.

41
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,931
- Aye.
- I didn't think you were in the tent that long.

42
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:50,140
It's true. The English ships
are coming from the South.

43
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:53,546
I don't know about the Welsh yet,
but the Irish have landed.

44
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,781
- I had to see it myself to believe it.
- Why are the Irish fighting with the English?

45
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:02,347
I wouldn't worry about them.
Didn't I tell you before?

46
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:04,788
It's my island.

47
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:09,127
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh
and assemble the council. Order it.

48
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,759
Right. Come on.

49
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:17,966
- Your island?
- My island. Yup.

50
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,771
- We'll have to negotiate.
- Please, gentlemen.

51
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:24,210
Lords, Craig is right.

52
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:30,116
This time our only option is to negotiate.
Unless you want to see Edinburgh razed...

53
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,589
My army has marched for many days.

54
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:45,157
And we still have preparations to make,
so I'll make this plain.

55
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:51,767
We require every soldier you can summon,
your personal escorts, even yourselves.

56
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:54,902
And we need them now.

57
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,145
With such a force arrayed against us,
it's time to discuss other options.

58
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,309
Other options?

59
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:05,644
Don't you wish at least
to lead your men onto the field

60
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:08,554
and barter a better deal with Longshanks

61
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:11,126
- before you run?
- Sir William...

62
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:13,059
- We cannot defeat them.
- We can.

63
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:15,562
- Sir William.
- And we will.

64
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:20,869
We won at Stirling, and still you quibble.

65
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:25,637
We won at York
and you would not support us.

66
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,973
If you'll no stand up with us now,
I'd say you're cowards.

67
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,377
If you are Scotsmen,

68
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:39,422
I'm ashamed to call myself one.

69
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,987
Please, Sir William, speak with me alone.

70
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,357
I beg you.

71
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:53,466
You've achieved so much,
but fighting these odds,

72
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,403
it looks like rage, not courage.

73
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:58,566
It's well beyond rage.

74
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,007
Help me.

75
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:07,277
In the name of Christ, help yourselves.

76
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:09,443
Now is our chance. Now.

77
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,680
If we join, we can win. If we win,

78
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,586
we'll have what none of us
have ever had before.

79
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,386
A country of our own.

80
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:24,500
You're the rightful leader
and there is strength in you, I see it.

81
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,837
Unite us.

82
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:36,738
Unite us. Unite the clans.

83
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,946
- All right.
- Right.

84
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,526
This cannot be the way.

85
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:59,432
You said yourself
the nobles will not support Wallace.

86
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:05,069
So how does it help us
to join the side that is slaughtered?

87
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,968
I gave him my word.

88
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:20,179
I know it is hard. Being a leader is.

89
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:23,951
My son...

90
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,859
Son...

91
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,589
Look at me.

92
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,203
I cannot be King.

93
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:39,901
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

94
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,942
What I tell you, you must do.

95
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:45,740
Not for me, not for yourself,

96
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,542
but for your country.

97
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,998
Right, lads, make way. Coming through.

98
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:16,203
Make way, lads.

99
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:25,377
- The Bruce is not coming, William.
- He'll come.

100
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:29,748
Mornay and Lochlan have come.

101
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:33,253
So will the Bruce.

102
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:40,034
Quite a lovely... gathering.

103
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:43,435
Wouldn't you agree?

104
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:49,377
- The archers are ready, sire.
- Not the archers.

105
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:53,177
My scouts say their archers
are miles away and no threat.

106
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:58,016
Arrows cost money.
Use up the Irish. The dead cost nothing.

107
00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:00,556
And send in the infantry and cavalry.

108
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,683
Infantry.

109
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,951
Cavalry.

110
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:10,889
Advance.

111
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:39,481
Ah, good to see ye this morning.

112
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,319
Irish!

113
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,290
Glad to have ye with us. Watch this.

114
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,719
Mornay? Lochlan?

115
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:02,730
I gave Mornay
double his lands in Scotland

116
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:04,857
and matching estates in England.

117
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:08,402
Lochlan turned... for much less.

118
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:10,533
Archers.

119
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,632
I beg your pardon, sire?
Won't we hit our own troops?

120
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:17,704
Yes.

121
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:21,443
But we'll hit theirs as well. We have reserves.

122
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,746
Attack.

123
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,545
Archers.

124
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:07,257
Send in our reinforcements.

125
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,060
Send in the rest.

126
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,371
Bring me Wallace. Alive, if possible.

127
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,538
Dead... just as good.

128
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:30,684
Send us news of our victory. Shall we retire?

129
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:57,764
Protect the King.

130
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:04,098
Get up.

131
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:08,435
Get up.

132
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:11,305
- Get him out of here.
- Jesus.

133
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:17,707
Go.

134
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:20,433
I'm dying.

135
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,638
Let me be.

136
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:32,514
No.

137
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:35,281
You're going to live.

138
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:39,484
I've lived long enough to live free.

139
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:42,494
Proud...

140
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,123
to see you become the man you are.

141
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:52,065
I'm a happy man.

142
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,844
I'm the one who's rotting.

143
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:47,821
But I think your face looks graver than mine.

144
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:54,024
Son...

145
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:04,071
We must have alliance
with England to prevail here.

146
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:06,232
You achieved that.

147
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:10,605
You saved your family
and increased your land.

148
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,742
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

149
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:17,786
Lands.

150
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:20,185
Titles. Men.

151
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,985
Power. Nothing.

152
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:24,992
- Nothing?
- I have nothing.

153
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:31,061
Men fight for me because if they do not
I throw them off my land

154
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:34,261
and I starve their wives and their children.

155
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:36,462
Those men

156
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:39,564
who bled the ground red at Falkirk...

157
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:46,205
They fought for William Wallace, and he
fights for something that I've never had.

158
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:51,817
And I took it from him when I betrayed him

159
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:54,788
and I saw it in his face on the battlefield.

160
00:22:54,857 --> 00:22:57,087
And it's tearing me apart.

161
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,024
Well, all men betray. All lose heart.

162
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:03,860
I don't want to lose heart.

163
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:09,796
I want to believe...

164
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,232
as he does.

165
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,113
I will never be on the wrong side again.

166
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:12,957
No.

167
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:11,052
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

168
00:25:11,153 --> 00:25:16,147
Aye. Wallace rode into his bedchamber
and killed him.

169
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:19,160
More of a liability now than ever he was.

170
00:25:19,962 --> 00:25:22,556
And there's no telling who'll be next.

171
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,859
Maybe you.

172
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,563
Maybe me.

173
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,636
It doesn't matter.

174
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:41,681
- I'm serious, Robert.
- So am I.

175
00:25:54,896 --> 00:25:56,796
Christ. Shit.

176
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,892
Search the place.

177
00:26:02,504 --> 00:26:04,836
Lochlan.

178
00:26:10,646 --> 00:26:12,910
William Wallace killed 50 men.

179
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:15,941
50 if it was one.

180
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:20,613
100 men... with his own sword.
Cut through them like...

181
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:23,954
Moses through the Red Sea.

182
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:58,651
His legend grows.

183
00:26:58,727 --> 00:27:00,854
It will be worse than before.

184
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:06,458
He rallies new volunteers in every Scottish
town. When he replenishes his numbers...

185
00:27:06,535 --> 00:27:08,969
They're sheep. Mere sheep.

186
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:14,202
Easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd.

187
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:15,970
Very well.

188
00:27:17,546 --> 00:27:21,812
Pick a flock of your finest assassins
and set a meeting.

189
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:25,819
My Lord, Wallace is renowned
for his ability to smell an ambush.

190
00:27:29,758 --> 00:27:33,023
If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct

191
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:37,426
he warmed to our future Queen
and would trust her.

192
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:42,630
So we'll dispatch her
with the notion that she comes in peace.

193
00:27:42,738 --> 00:27:45,536
My Lord,
the Princess might be taken hostage

194
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:47,700
or her life be put in jeopardy.

195
00:27:47,776 --> 00:27:51,576
My son would be most distressed by that.

196
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:55,314
But in truth if she were to be killed,

197
00:27:55,384 --> 00:28:01,584
we would soon find the King of France
a useful ally against the Scots.

198
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:05,318
You see...

199
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:10,457
As King, you must find
the good in any situation.

200
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:39,553
It's William Wallace, sure.

201
00:28:40,362 --> 00:28:44,389
And he's given up his sword. Be ready.

202
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,326
My Lady.

203
00:30:29,104 --> 00:30:31,095
I received your message.

204
00:30:44,085 --> 00:30:48,419
This is... the second time
you've warned me of danger.

205
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,124
Why?

206
00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:56,129
There will be a new shipment
of supplies coming north next month.

207
00:30:56,197 --> 00:30:58,188
Foods and weapons. They will...

208
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,392
No, stop.

209
00:31:01,836 --> 00:31:03,929
Why do you help me?

210
00:31:10,312 --> 00:31:12,371
Why do you help me?

211
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:15,911
Because of the way
you are looking at me now.

212
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:11,029
Just when we thought all hope was lost,

213
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:13,761
our noble saviors have arrived.

214
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:19,231
Off with their hoods.

215
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:26,276
Sir William, we come to seek a meeting.

216
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,474
Well, what's the point?

217
00:33:29,651 --> 00:33:34,054
- You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.
- An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

218
00:33:34,122 --> 00:33:36,886
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

219
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:39,051
So let the council swear publicly.

220
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:43,164
We cannot.
Some scarcely believe you're alive.

221
00:33:43,264 --> 00:33:47,496
Others think you'll pay them Mornay's wages.
So we bid you to Edinburgh.

222
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:51,869
Meet us two days from now. Pledge us
your pardon and we'll unite behind you.

223
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,999
- Scotland will be one.
- One?

224
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:56,577
- You mean us and you.
- No.

225
00:33:58,346 --> 00:34:00,678
I mean this.

226
00:34:02,484 --> 00:34:04,884
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

227
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:16,521
You do know it's a trap. Tell him.

228
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:20,034
If the Bruce wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it at Falkirk.

229
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:21,295
Aye.

230
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:22,961
I know. I saw.

231
00:34:23,037 --> 00:34:26,564
All right, leaving him aside,
what about the others?

232
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:32,136
Scheming bastards who couldn't agree on
the color of shite. It's a trap. Are you blind?

233
00:34:32,213 --> 00:34:34,306
Look at us.

234
00:34:35,183 --> 00:34:37,743
We've got to try. We can't do this alone.

235
00:34:39,354 --> 00:34:43,723
Joining the nobles is our only hope.
You know what happens if we don't?

236
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,384
What?

237
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:47,154
Nothing.

238
00:34:48,563 --> 00:34:52,055
- I don't want to be a martyr.
- Nor I.

239
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:54,226
I want to live.

240
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:57,031
I want a home, and children. And peace.

241
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:59,197
- Do ye?
- Aye, I do.

242
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:03,836
I've asked God for those things.
It's all for nothing if you don't have freedom.

243
00:35:03,945 --> 00:35:06,880
- It's just a dream, William.
- A dream? Just a...

244
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:11,612
Well, then,
what have we been doing all this time?

245
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:14,381
We've lived that dream.

246
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:17,652
Your dream isn't about freedom.
It's about Murron.

247
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:21,058
You're doing this to be a hero
because you think she sees ye.

248
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,426
I don't think she sees me. I know she does.

249
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:27,491
And your father sees you, too.

250
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:38,837
Jesus.

251
00:35:46,254 --> 00:35:48,313
Shall I come with you?

252
00:35:49,424 --> 00:35:52,257
No. I'll go alone.

253
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:56,929
- I'll see you after.
- Right.

254
00:36:01,936 --> 00:36:04,097
Sooner rather than later, I hope.

255
00:36:10,612 --> 00:36:12,671
- He won't come.
- He will.

256
00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:16,208
I know he will.

257
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:31,857
My Lord. He approaches.

258
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,969
No!

259
00:37:22,684 --> 00:37:24,743
Stay out of it, Robert.

260
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,948
Get away.

261
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:34,959
The Bruce is not to be harmed,
that's the arrangement.

262
00:37:42,737 --> 00:37:44,227
Father!

263
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:53,044
You rotting bastard!

264
00:37:53,748 --> 00:37:55,340
Why?

265
00:38:00,355 --> 00:38:02,414
Longshanks required Wallace.

266
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:05,751
So did our nobles.

267
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:09,058
That was the price of your crown.

268
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:10,425
Die.

269
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:13,992
I want you to die.

270
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:16,366
Soon enough I'll be dead.

271
00:38:16,437 --> 00:38:20,430
- And you'll be King.
- I don't want anything from you.

272
00:38:21,075 --> 00:38:23,168
You're not a man.

273
00:38:23,945 --> 00:38:26,004
And you're not my father.

274
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,743
You're my son

275
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:34,219
and you have always known my mind.

276
00:38:36,624 --> 00:38:39,787
- You deceived me.
- You let yourself be deceived.

277
00:38:40,561 --> 00:38:44,053
In your heart, you always knew
what had to happen here.

278
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:50,798
At last, you know what it means to hate.

279
00:38:55,676 --> 00:38:58,076
Now you're ready to be a king.

280
00:38:59,814 --> 00:39:01,679
My hate...

281
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:03,910
will die with you.

282
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:13,383
William Wallace,
you stand in taint of high treason.

283
00:39:14,695 --> 00:39:17,892
- Against whom?
- Against your King.

284
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,259
Have you anything to say?

285
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:24,229
Never in my whole life

286
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,935
did I swear allegiance to him.

287
00:39:29,343 --> 00:39:32,437
It matters not. He is your King.

288
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:37,916
Confess and you may receive a quick death.

289
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:41,688
Deny and you must be purified by pain.

290
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,849
Do you confess?

291
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:48,690
Do you confess?

292
00:39:54,335 --> 00:39:57,930
Then on the morrow
you shall receive your purification.

293
00:40:09,684 --> 00:40:12,152
- Your Highness.
- I will see the prisoner.

294
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:16,121
- The King ordered...
- The King will die soon and his son is weak.

295
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,556
Who do you think will rule this kingdom?

296
00:40:18,693 --> 00:40:20,752
Now open this door.

297
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:24,556
Your Majesty.

298
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:32,196
Come on, filth. Up on your feet.

299
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:35,207
Stop it. Leave me.

300
00:40:36,944 --> 00:40:39,003
I said leave me.

301
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:53,885
My Lady.

302
00:40:53,961 --> 00:40:56,020
Sir...

303
00:40:56,764 --> 00:40:58,823
I come to beg you...

304
00:41:00,234 --> 00:41:05,137
to confess all and swear allegiance
to the King that he might show you mercy.

305
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:08,506
Will he show mercy to my country?

306
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:11,436
Mercy is to die quickly,

307
00:41:11,546 --> 00:41:13,605
perhaps even live in the Tower.

308
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:16,308
In time, who knows what can happen?

309
00:41:17,985 --> 00:41:20,044
If you can only live...

310
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:26,584
If I swear to him...

311
00:41:27,228 --> 00:41:30,425
then all that I am is dead already.

312
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,001
You will die. It will be awful.

313
00:41:42,076 --> 00:41:44,169
Every man dies.

314
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:49,174
Not every man really lives.

315
00:41:55,823 --> 00:41:57,882
Drink this.

316
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,451
It will dull your pain.

317
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,961
No. It will numb my wits.

318
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,089
And I must have them all.

319
00:42:05,866 --> 00:42:08,426
For if I'm senseless or if I wail

320
00:42:08,502 --> 00:42:10,834
then Longshanks will have broken me.

321
00:42:11,472 --> 00:42:14,100
I can't bear the thought of your torture.

322
00:42:14,976 --> 00:42:17,035
Take it.

323
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:23,110
All right.

324
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:12,057
I have come

325
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:14,499
to beg for the life of William Wallace.

326
00:43:16,871 --> 00:43:19,738
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

327
00:43:19,874 --> 00:43:21,967
I respect him.

328
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,305
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

329
00:43:25,379 --> 00:43:29,543
Show mercy, O thou great King,
and win the respect of your own people.

330
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,453
Even now

331
00:43:42,196 --> 00:43:44,687
you are incapable of mercy.

332
00:43:51,105 --> 00:43:53,164
And you...

333
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,707
To you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.

334
00:44:00,748 --> 00:44:03,273
Before he lost his powers of speech

335
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:07,481
he told me his one comfort was that
he would live to know Wallace was dead.

336
00:44:26,574 --> 00:44:28,633
You see?

337
00:44:29,844 --> 00:44:31,937
Death comes to us all.

338
00:44:41,989 --> 00:44:44,048
But before it comes to you,

339
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:47,152
know this:

340
00:44:47,361 --> 00:44:49,420
Your blood dies with you.

341
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:55,569
A child who is not of your line
grows in my belly.

342
00:44:58,472 --> 00:45:02,340
Your son will not sit long on the throne,
I swear it.

343
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:42,640
I'm so afraid.

344
00:45:49,924 --> 00:45:52,017
Give me the strength...

345
00:45:52,927 --> 00:45:55,020
to die well.

346
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:20,350
Here he comes.

347
00:47:49,143 --> 00:47:51,509
Now behold the awful price of treason.

348
00:47:58,419 --> 00:48:00,512
Or fall to your knees now,

349
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:05,721
declare yourself the King's loyal subject

350
00:48:06,961 --> 00:48:08,792
and beg his mercy

351
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:17,828
and you shall have it.

352
00:48:29,216 --> 00:48:30,740
Rope.

353
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:45,423
Raise him.

354
00:48:52,506 --> 00:48:54,804
Stretch him.

355
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,401
That's it.

356
00:48:58,479 --> 00:49:00,572
Stretch him.

357
00:49:36,717 --> 00:49:38,912
Pleasant, yes?

358
00:49:42,156 --> 00:49:44,090
Rise to your knees.

359
00:49:44,158 --> 00:49:47,025
Kiss the royal emblem on my cloak

360
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:48,822
and you will feel no more.

361
00:50:30,604 --> 00:50:32,572
Rack him.

362
00:51:26,727 --> 00:51:28,388
Enough?

363
00:52:21,048 --> 00:52:23,107
It can all end...

364
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:25,681
right now.

365
00:52:25,786 --> 00:52:27,447
Peace.

366
00:52:28,255 --> 00:52:29,813
Bliss.

367
00:52:30,457 --> 00:52:31,719
Just say it.

368
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,919
Cry out...

369
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:36,689
"Mercy."

370
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:47,072
Mercy.

371
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,266
Mercy.

372
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:56,273
Cry out.

373
00:53:03,023 --> 00:53:06,959
Just say it. "Mercy."

374
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:34,543
- Mercy, William. Mercy.
- Jesus, man, say it.

375
00:53:40,294 --> 00:53:43,752
The prisoner wishes to say a word.

376
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:06,882
Freedom!

377
00:55:59,266 --> 00:56:01,700
After the beheading,

378
00:56:01,802 --> 00:56:05,135
William Wallace's body was torn to pieces.

379
00:56:07,808 --> 00:56:10,606
His head was set on London Bridge.

380
00:56:12,345 --> 00:56:14,813
His arms and legs

381
00:56:14,881 --> 00:56:17,611
sent to the four corners of Britain

382
00:56:18,118 --> 00:56:20,211
as a warning.

383
00:56:20,287 --> 00:56:24,121
It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.

384
00:56:25,959 --> 00:56:29,087
And I, Robert the Bruce,

385
00:56:29,162 --> 00:56:33,360
rode out to pay homage
to the armies of the English King

386
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:37,665
and accept his endorsement of my crown.

387
00:56:37,737 --> 00:56:40,262
I hope you've washed your arse this morning.

388
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:43,100
It's about to be kissed by a king.

389
00:57:13,106 --> 00:57:15,165
Come. Let's get it over with.

390
00:57:27,687 --> 00:57:29,621
Stop.

391
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,909
You have bled with Wallace!

392
00:57:55,148 --> 00:57:57,810
Now bleed with me.

393
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,986
Wallace!

394
00:59:04,217 --> 00:59:07,277
In the year of our Lord 1314,

395
00:59:08,221 --> 00:59:11,486
patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered,

396
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:14,992
charged the fields of Bannockburn.

397
00:59:15,595 --> 00:59:17,927
They fought like warrior poets.

398
00:59:18,465 --> 00:59:20,660
They fought like Scotsmen

399
00:59:21,701 --> 00:59:23,794
and won their freedom.
