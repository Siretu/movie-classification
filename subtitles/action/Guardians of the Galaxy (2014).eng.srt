1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,074
 
 

2
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,450
Peter.

3
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,060
Your momma wants to speak with you.

4
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,310
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

5
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,410
Why have you been fighting with
the other boys again, baby?

6
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,150
Peter?

7
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,850
They killed a little frog
that ain't done nothing.

8
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,060
Smushed it with a stick.

9
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,690
You're so like your daddy.

10
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,390
You even look like him.

11
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,720
And he was an angel.

12
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,440
- Composed out of pure light.
- Mer?

13
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,940
You got a present there
for Peter, don't you?

14
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,430
Of course.

15
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,710
There.

16
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,210
I've got you covered, Pete.

17
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,490
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

18
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,590
Your grandpa

19
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,730
is gonna take such good care of you.

20
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,100
At least until your daddy
comes back to get you.

21
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,940
Take my hand.

22
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,170
Peter.

23
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,580
Pete, come on.

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,880
Take my hand.

25
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,860
Mom?

26
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,930
No! No! No! No!

27
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,360
Mom! No!

28
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,000
- Come with me.
- No!

29
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,330
No!

30
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,200
You've got to stay here. Please.

31
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,770
No...

32
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,600
Okay?

33
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,220
No.

34
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,500
Mom!

35
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,800
Drop it!

36
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,630
Hey.

37
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,910
- Drop it, now!
- Hey, cool, man. No problem.

38
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,440
No problem at all.

39
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,310
How do you know about this?

40
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,050
I don't even know what that is.

41
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,780
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

42
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,220
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

43
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,590
This is just an outfit, man.

44
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,260
- Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.
- What is your name?

45
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,630
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

46
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,130
- Move!
- Why?

47
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,530
Ronan may have questions for you.

48
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,090
Hey, you know what? There's another
name you might know me by.

49
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,800
Star-Lord.

50
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,930
- Who?
- Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

51
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,230
- Guys?
- Move!

52
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,340
Forget this.

53
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,660
Peter?

54
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,600
What happened?

55
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,020
Hey...

56
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,190
I...

57
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,540
- Bereet.
- Bereet!

58
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,570
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest
with you. I forgot you're here.

59
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,200
Scattered riots broke out
across the Kree Empire today

60
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,800
protesting the recent peace
treaty signed by the Kree Emperor

61
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,870
and Xandar's Nova Prime.

62
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,740
Peter, you have call.

63
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,240
- No, wait, don't!
- Quill?

64
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,580
Hey, Yondu.

65
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,750
I'm here on Morag.

66
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,050
Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.

67
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,320
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

68
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,690
Well, where are you at now, boy?

69
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,360
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

70
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,960
- I slaved putting this deal together.
- Slaved?

71
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,100
Making a few calls is "slaved"?
I mean, really?

72
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,230
And now you're gonna rip me off!

73
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,840
We do not do that to each other.
We're Ravagers. We got a code.

74
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,670
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

75
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,640
- When I picked you up on Terra...
- "Picked me up."

76
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,680
- ...these boys of mine wanted to eat you.
- Yeah?

77
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,810
They ain't never tasted
any Terran before.

78
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,150
I stopped them.
You're alive because of me!

79
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,940
I will find you, I will...

80
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,590
Put a bounty on him! Forty K.

81
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,320
- But I want him back alive.
- Yeah, Cap.

82
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,860
- Alive?
- That's what I said.

83
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,290
I told you when you picked that kid up,
you should have delivered him

84
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,060
like we was hired to do!
He was cargo!

85
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,900
- You have always been soft on him.
- You're the only one I'm being soft on!

86
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,770
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

87
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,340
As soon as we get him back here,

88
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,170
I'm gonna kill him myself.

89
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,070
What we do need to worry about,

90
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,880
is who else out there wants that Orb!

91
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,530
They call me "terrorist,"

92
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,800
"radical," "zealot,"

93
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,800
because I obey the ancient
laws of my people, the Kree,

94
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,650
and punish those who do not.

95
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,880
Because I do not forgive your people

96
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,970
for taking the life of my father,

97
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:50,020
and his father,
and his father before him.

98
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,760
A thousand years of war between
us will not be forgotten!

99
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,160
You can't do this! Our government
signed a peace treaty.

100
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,600
My government knows no shame.

101
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,530
You Xandarians and your
culture are a disease.

102
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,510
You

103
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,910
will never rule Xandar.

104
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,500
No.

105
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,540
I will cure it!

106
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,400
Ronan,

107
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,360
Korath has returned.

108
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,670
Master, he is a thief,

109
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,840
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

110
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,470
But we have discovered
he has an agreement

111
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,380
to retrieve the Orb for
an intermediary known

112
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,010
as The Broker.

113
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,550
I promised Thanos I would
retrieve the Orb for him.

114
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,710
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

115
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,020
Nebula, go to Xandar
and get me the Orb.

116
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,490
It will be my honor.

117
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,080
It will be your doom.

118
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,430
If this happens again,
you'll be facing our father

119
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,230
without his prize.

120
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,300
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

121
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,530
Just like you.

122
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,970
But I know Xandar.

123
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,740
Ronan has already decreed that I...

124
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,300
Do not speak for me.

125
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,810
You will not fail.

126
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,140
Have I ever?

127
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,600
Xandarians.

128
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,900
What a bunch of losers.

129
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,570
All of them in a big hurry to
get from something stupid,

130
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,910
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

131
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,970
Look at this guy!

132
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,640
Can you believe they call us criminals,

133
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,080
when he's assaulting
us with that haircut?

134
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,950
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

135
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,650
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

136
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,150
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

137
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,520
Where's your wife, old man?
What a class-A prevert.

138
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,660
Right, Groot?

139
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,830
Groot?

140
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,830
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

141
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,470
That's disgusting!

142
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,500
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

143
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,190
Why are you lying?

144
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,340
Looks like we got one.

145
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,900
Okay, humie, how bad does
someone wanna find you?

146
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:32,580
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

147
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,860
- Mr. Quill.
- Broker.

148
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,240
The Orb.

149
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,840
- As commissioned.
- Where's Yondu?

150
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,680
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

151
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,810
And told me to tell you,

152
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,610
that you got the best
eyebrows in the business.

153
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,840
What is it?

154
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,490
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

155
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,620
Yeah, well, I almost
died getting it for you.

156
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,120
An occupational hazard,
I'm sure, in your line of work.

157
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,060
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

158
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,960
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

159
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,070
I truly am.

160
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,330
But I want no part of this
transaction if Ronan is involved.

161
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,070
Who's Ronan?

162
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,410
A Kree fanatic,
outraged by the peace treaty,

163
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,850
who will not rest until
Xandarian culture, my culture,

164
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,660
- is wiped from existence!
- Come on.

165
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,120
He's someone whose bad
side I'd rather not be on.

166
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,750
- What? What about my bad side?
- Farewell, Mr. Quill.

167
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,460
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

168
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,590
What happened?

169
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,000
This guy just backed out of a deal on me.
If there's one thing I hate,

170
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,830
it's a man without integrity.
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

171
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,180
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

172
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,840
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

173
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,650
People say it about me, all the time,

174
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,420
but it's not something I
would ever say about myself.

175
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,130
This wasn't the plan.

176
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,410
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag!

177
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,810
No! Not her, him!

178
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,810
Learn genders, man.

179
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,340
Biting? That's not fair!

180
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,480
Take it easy!

181
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,450
Fool. You should have learned.

182
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,820
I don't learn. One of my issues.

183
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,160
What the...

184
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,530
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

185
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,170
You gotta be kidding me.

186
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,140
Hey!

187
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,830
I live for the simple things.

188
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,590
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

189
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,540
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

190
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,680
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

191
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,740
Quit whining.

192
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,350
Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.

193
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,060
Crap.

194
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,590
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

195
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,490
- you are under arrest...
- All right. Come on up.

196
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,760
...for endangerment to life and
the destruction of property.

197
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,030
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

198
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,400
- Star-Lord.
- Sorry. "Lord."

199
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,110
I picked this guy up a while back for
petty theft. He's got a code name.

200
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,240
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

201
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,210
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

202
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,010
Just relax, pal.

203
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,670
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

204
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,770
Fascists.

205
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,230
Ronan is destroying Xandarian
outposts throughout the galaxy.

206
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,200
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

207
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,170
We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime.
What more do you want?

208
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,610
At least a statement from the Kree Empire
saying that they condemn his actions.

209
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,720
He is slaughtering children.
Families.

210
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,680
That is your business. Now,
I have other matters to attend to.

211
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,120
Prick.

212
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,360
Well, some good news.

213
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,900
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

214
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,270
Gamora. Surgically modified and
trained as a living weapon.

215
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,200
The adopted daughter of
the Mad Titan, Thanos.

216
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,470
Recently, Thanos lent her and
her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

217
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,840
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

218
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,320
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

219
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,780
The result of illegal genetic

220
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,990
and cybernetic experiments
on a lower life form.

221
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,160
What the hell?

222
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,820
They call it "Groot."

223
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,390
A humanoid plant that's
been travelling recently

224
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,120
as 89P13's personal
houseplantlmuscle.

225
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,970
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

226
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,140
Raised from youth by a band of
mercenaries called the Ravagers,

227
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,070
led by Yondu Udonta.

228
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,670
I'm sorry.

229
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,740
I didn't know how this machine worked.

230
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,350
What a bunch of a-holes.

231
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,380
Transport all four to the Kyln.

232
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,190
I guess most of Nova Corps
wanna uphold the laws,

233
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,860
but these ones here,
they're corrupt and cruel.

234
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,830
But, hey, that's not my problem.
I ain't gonna be here long.

235
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:53,400
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

236
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,070
You're lucky the broad showed up,
because otherwise, me and Groot

237
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,000
would be collecting
that bounty right now,

238
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,140
and you'd be getting drawn and
quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.

239
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,380
I've had a lot of folks try
to kill me over the years.

240
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,280
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

241
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,450
Hold.

242
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,450
- What's a raccoon?
- "What's a raccoon?"

243
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,850
It's what you are, stupid.

244
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,990
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

245
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,660
So, this Orb has a real
shiny blue suitcase,

246
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,250
Ark of the Covenant,
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

247
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,790
- What is it?
- I am Groot.

248
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,560
So what? What's the Orb?

249
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,870
I have no words for an honorless thief.

250
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,470
Pretty high and mighty coming from
the lackey of a genocidal maniac.

251
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,440
Yeah, I know who you are.

252
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,210
- Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.
- Yeah, we know who you are.

253
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,810
- Who is she?
- I am Groot.

254
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,310
Yeah, you said that.

255
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,920
I wasn't retrieving the Orb
for Ronan. I was betraying him.

256
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,490
I had an agreement to
sell it to a third party.

257
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,390
I am Groot.

258
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,730
Well, that's just as fascinating as
the first 89 times you told me that.

259
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,000
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

260
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,300
Well, he don't know talking
good like me and you.

261
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,470
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

262
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,270
Exclusively in that order.

263
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,070
I tell you what, that's gonna
wear real thin, real fast.

264
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,870
Hey. Put that away.

265
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,810
Hey!

266
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,250
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

267
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:20,450
That's mine. Those belong to impound.
That tape and that player is mine!

268
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:28,560
Hooked on a Feeling, Blue Swede, 1973.
That song belongs to me!

269
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,140
- You first! You first!
- Murderer!

270
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,780
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

271
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,580
You're scum! You're scum!

272
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,290
It's like I said,

273
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,220
she's got a rep.

274
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,290
A lot of prisoners here
have lost their families

275
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,460
to Ronan and his goons.

276
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,830
She'll last a day, tops.

277
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,500
Murderer!

278
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,130
The guards will protect her, right?

279
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,500
They're here to stop us from getting out.

280
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,570
They don't care what we
do to each other inside.

281
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,210
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

282
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:25,400
are dreams compared
to what's behind me.

283
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,880
Check out the new meat.

284
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,720
I'm gonna slather you
up in Gunavian jelly,

285
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,580
and go to town...

286
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,990
Let's make something clear.

287
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,220
This one here is our booty!

288
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,730
You wanna get to him,

289
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,060
you go through us!

290
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,110
Or, more accurately,

291
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,110
we go through you.

292
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,910
I'm with them.

293
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,110
I hate you.

294
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,450
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

295
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,200
You're dead!

296
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,770
Dead!

297
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,340
Take her down to the showers.

298
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,730
It'll be easier to clean
up the blood down there.

299
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,710
Quill, where you going?

300
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,080
Quill.

301
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,990
Quill!

302
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,030
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

303
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,260
for your crimes against the galaxy.

304
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,020
You dare?

305
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,070
You know who I am, yes?

306
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,680
You're Drax.

307
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,910
The Destroyer.

308
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,010
Quill!

309
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,080
And you know why they call me this.

310
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,210
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

311
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,690
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

312
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,220
and my daughter, Camaria.

313
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,790
He slaughtered them where they stood.

314
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,060
And he laughed!

315
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,130
Quill?

316
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,790
Her life

317
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,570
is not yours to take.

318
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:05,560
He killed my family.

319
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,430
I shall kill one of his in return.

320
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,900
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

321
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,150
Quill! What are you doing?

322
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,950
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

323
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,260
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

324
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,500
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!

325
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,140
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Crap.

326
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,410
You know, if killing Ronan
is truly your sole purpose,

327
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,310
I don't think this is the
best way to go about it.

328
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,650
Are you not the man this
wench attempted to kill?

329
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,120
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first
woman to try and do that to me.

330
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,790
Look, this is from a
smoking-hot Rajak girl.

331
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,120
Stabbed me with a fork. Didn't like
me skipping out on her at sunrise.

332
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,790
I got, right here, a Kree girl
tried to rip out my thorax.

333
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,060
She caught me with this skinny little
A'askavariian who worked in Nova Records.

334
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,570
I was trying to get information.
You ever see an A'askavariian?

335
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,540
They have tentacles,
and needles for teeth.

336
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,330
If you think I'm seriously
interested in that, then...

337
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,860
You don't care. But here's the point.

338
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,410
She betrayed Ronan.
He's coming back for her.

339
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,210
And when he does,

340
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,650
that's when you...

341
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,150
Why would I put my
finger on his throat?

342
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,780
What?

343
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,590
No, it's a symbol.

344
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:37,360
This is a symbol for
you slicing his throat.

345
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,430
I would not slice his throat.

346
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,300
I would cut his head clean off.

347
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,500
It's a general expression
for you killing somebody.

348
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,140
You've heard of this.
You've seen this, right?

349
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,670
- You know what that is.
- Yeah. Yeah.

350
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,900
- Everyone knows.
- No, no.

351
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,010
What I'm saying is,
you want to keep her alive.

352
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,080
Don't do his work for him.

353
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,460
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

354
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,300
- That was my favorite knife.
- Listen!

355
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,540
I could care less whether
you live or whether you die.

356
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,800
- Then why stop the big guy?
- Simple.

357
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,210
You know where to sell my Orb.

358
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:27,000
How are we gonna sell it
when we and it are still here?

359
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,300
My friend Rocket, here,

360
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,180
has escaped 22 prisons.

361
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,520
We're getting out.

362
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,590
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

363
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,780
How much was your buyer
willing to pay you for my Orb?

364
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,960
Four billion units.

365
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,900
- What?
- Holy shit.

366
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,020
That Orb is my opportunity to
get away from Thanos and Ronan.

367
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,960
If you free us,

368
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,740
I'll lead you to the buyer directly and I'll
split the profit between the three of us.

369
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,910
I am Groot.

370
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,080
Four of us.

371
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,750
Asleep for the danger, awake for
the money, as per frickin' usual.

372
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,120
You have been betrayed, Ronan.

373
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,350
We know only that
she has been captured.

374
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,960
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

375
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:15,490
No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.

376
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,200
Look, your partnership with Thanos

377
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,490
is at risk.

378
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,990
Thanos requires your presence. Now!

379
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,150
With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

380
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,750
and yet you summon me.

381
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,750
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

382
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,920
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

383
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,890
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

384
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,760
Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

385
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,660
You are the one here with
nothing to show for it.

386
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,860
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

387
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,300
Lower your tone!

388
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,860
I may be your...

389
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:05,980
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

390
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,650
The only matter I do not
take seriously, boy,

391
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,480
is you.

392
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,320
Your politics bore me.

393
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,490
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

394
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:23,750
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

395
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,830
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

396
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,200
if you bring me the Orb.

397
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,630
But return to me again empty-handed,

398
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,110
and I will bathe the
starways in your blood.

399
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,340
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

400
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,380
This is one fight you won't win.

401
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,280
Let's head to the Kyln.

402
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,470
If we're gonna get out of here, we're
gonna need to get into that watchtower.

403
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,700
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

404
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:09,780
The guards wear security bands to
control their ins and outs. I need one.

405
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,310
Leave it to me.

406
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,210
That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

407
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,050
- His leg?
- Yeah.

408
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,650
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

409
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,750
All right.

410
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,160
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

411
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,230
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

412
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,460
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

413
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,700
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

414
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,200
How are we supposed to do that?

415
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,570
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

416
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,300
So, maybe you can work
out some sort of trade.

417
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,540
You must be joking.

418
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,410
No, I really heard they
find you attractive.

419
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,110
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

420
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,610
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

421
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,480
It's impossible to get up
there without being seen.

422
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,780
I got one plan, and that plan
requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,

423
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,480
so figure it out!

424
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,320
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

425
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,990
Now, this is important.
Once the battery is removed,

426
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,460
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

427
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,700
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,
so you definitely need to get that last.

428
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,070
Or we could just get
it first and improvise.

429
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,700
- I'll get the armband.
- Leg.

430
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,390
Prisoner, drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,

431
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,820
or we will open fire.

432
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,540
I am

433
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,410
Groot!

434
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,340
Fire!

435
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,250
All prisoners return to
your sleeping areas.

436
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,800
You idiot!

437
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,090
How am I supposed to fight
these things without my stuff?

438
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,510
The animal is in control.

439
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,040
Fire on my command!

440
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,860
Creepy little beast!

441
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,460
Oh, yeah.

442
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,250
You need my what?

443
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,540
- I'll need this.
- Good luck.

444
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,070
It's internally wired.

445
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,260
I'll figure something out.

446
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,910
Drop the leg!

447
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,070
Drop the leg and move
back to your cell!

448
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,330
Rocket!

449
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,500
Move to the watchtower!

450
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,520
You!

451
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,130
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

452
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,630
It was one time, man.

453
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,970
We need all available guards
in full combat gear...

454
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,830
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

455
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,990
Why is this one here?

456
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,640
We promised him he could stay by
your side until he kills your boss.

457
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,680
I always keep my promises,
when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs

458
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,510
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

459
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,650
I was just kidding about the leg.
I just need these two things.

460
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,450
- What?
- No, I thought it'd be funny.

461
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,450
Was it funny? Wait, what did
he look like hopping around?

462
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,950
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

463
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,950
How are we going to leave?

464
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,930
Well, he's got a plan. Right?
Or is that another thing you made up?

465
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,630
I have a plan! I have a plan!

466
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:39,070
Cease your yammering and relieve
us from this irksome confinement.

467
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,440
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the
walking thesaurus on that one.

468
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,480
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

469
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:46,910
It's just a metaphor, dude.

470
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,880
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

471
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,680
Nothing goes over my head.

472
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,340
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

473
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:59,820
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

474
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,360
Those are some big guns.

475
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,830
On my command!

476
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,770
Number one!

477
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:16,130
- Rodent, we are ready for your plan.
- Hold on!

478
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,470
Number two!

479
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:24,020
I recognize this animal. We'd roast
them over a flame pit as children.

480
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,720
- Their flesh was quite delicious.
- Not helping!

481
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,290
Number three!

482
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:37,030
All fire on my command!

483
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,600
Three!

484
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,230
Two!

485
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,960
One!

486
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,720
He turned off the artificial gravity,

487
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,250
everywhere but in here.

488
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,860
I told you I had a plan.

489
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,810
That was a pretty good plan.

490
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,200
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

491
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,970
It's the Milano, the orange and
blue one over in the corner.

492
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,870
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

493
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,430
That's rude! They folded yours.

494
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,280
The Orb's there. Let's go.

495
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,950
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

496
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,120
That bastard didn't put it back.

497
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,820
- Put what back?
- Here.

498
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,620
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

499
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,290
- How are you gonna possibly...
- Just keep the Milano close by.

500
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,730
Go.

501
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,550
Go!

502
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,710
My neck!

503
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,560
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

504
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,590
He declined to share that
information with me.

505
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,160
Well, screw this, then!

506
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,060
I ain't waiting around for some humie with
a death wish. You got the Orb, right?

507
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,220
Yes.

508
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,090
If we don't leave now,
we will be blown to bits.

509
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,160
No!

510
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,730
We're not leaving without the Orb.

511
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,660
Behold.

512
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,810
This one shows spirit.

513
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:17,850
He shall make a keen ally in
the battle against Ronan.

514
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,880
Companion, what were you retrieving?

515
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,580
You're an imbecile.

516
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,270
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

517
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,970
You can't take apart my
ship without asking me!

518
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,910
- See, what is this?
- Don't touch that!

519
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:45,980
It's a bomb.

520
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,150
- A bomb?
- Yup.

521
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,950
And you leave it lying around?

522
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,650
I was gonna put it in a box.

523
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,850
What's a box gonna do?

524
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,150
- How about this one?
- No! Hey!

525
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,250
- Leave it alone.
- Why? What is it?

526
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:57,320
- Shut up.
- Hey!

527
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,220
What is that?

528
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,430
That's for if things get really hardcore.

529
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:03,760
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

530
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,400
No one's blowing up moons.

531
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,670
You just wanna suck the
joy out of everything.

532
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,290
So, listen, I'm gonna need
your buyer's coordinates.

533
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,170
We're heading in the
right direction. For now.

534
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:15,810
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

535
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,410
And how much do you trust me?

536
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,940
I'd trust you a lot more if
you told me what this was.

537
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,380
Because I'm guessing it's
some kind of weapon.

538
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,780
I don't know what it is.

539
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,220
If it's a weapon, we should
use it against Ronan.

540
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,260
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

541
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,420
Or just you, murderess!

542
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,190
I let you live once, princess!

543
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,390
- I am not a princess!
- Hey!

544
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,520
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

545
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,370
We're stuck together
until we get the money.

546
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,670
I have no interest in money.

547
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,460
Great.

548
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:51,870
That means more money
for the three of us.

549
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,250
For the four of us. Partners.

550
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:01,040
We have an agreement, but I would
never be partners with the likes of you.

551
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:03,610
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

552
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,950
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

553
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:14,120
She has no idea.

554
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,230
If I had a black light,

555
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,300
the place would look like a
Jackson Pollock painting.

556
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,630
You got issues, Quill.

557
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:32,970
I swear. I don't know where
they went! I swear.

558
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,950
If he knew where they were headed,
he would have already told us.

559
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,490
Yeah.

560
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:41,830
Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a
fleet to defend the prison.

561
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:46,360
Well, then, send Necrocraft to
every corner of the quadrant.

562
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,930
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.

563
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:53,540
- And this place?
- The Nova can't know what we're after.

564
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,940
Cleanse it!

565
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,780
Do you got any other cute
little buggers like this one?

566
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,880
I like to stick 'em all in a
row on my control console.

567
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,090
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

568
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,320
He's being fully serious.

569
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,120
In that case, I can show you...

570
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,590
But first, you gonna tell
me what this Orb is,

571
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,350
and why everybody cares
so damn much about it.

572
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,300
And then you gonna tell me,

573
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,530
who out there might wanna buy it.

574
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,800
Sir, the high-end community is a...

575
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,140
The high-end community is a...

576
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:31,880
It's a tight-knit...

577
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,240
Tight-knit...

578
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,540
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

579
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,150
I cannot possibly betray

580
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,410
the confidentiality of my buyers!

581
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,960
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

582
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,540
Carina.

583
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,770
Yes, Master.

584
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,310
Your people do have elbows,
do they not?

585
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:04,840
We do, Master.

586
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,380
Then use them.

587
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:10,620
I don't have to remind you

588
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,190
what happened to the last
attendant who disappointed me.

589
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,180
Do I?

590
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:23,020
Chop, chop. Our guests
will be here soon.

591
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,390
Heads up! We're inbound.

592
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,810
What is it?

593
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:52,360
It's called Knowhere.

594
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,730
The severed head of an
ancient celestial being.

595
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:58,090
Be wary headed in, rodent.

596
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,420
There are no regulations
whatsoever here.

597
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,160
Hundreds of years ago,
the Tivan Group sent workers in

598
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,830
to mine the organic
matter within the skull.

599
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,230
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

600
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:39,440
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

601
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,170
It's dangerous and illegal work,
suitable only for outlaws.

602
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,470
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

603
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,950
Billy the Kid, Bonnie
and Clyde, John Stamos.

604
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,550
It sounds like a place,
which I would like to visit.

605
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,140
Yeah, you should.

606
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,150
Excuse me.

607
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,080
- Watch your wallets.
- Can you spare any units?

608
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,150
Get out of here.

609
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,270
Your buyer's in there?

610
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:15,270
We are to wait here
for his representative.

611
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:16,870
Get out of here!

612
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,210
This is no respectable establishment.

613
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,840
What do you expect
us to do while we wait?

614
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,740
Yes! Yes!

615
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,190
Yahoo!

616
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,530
My Orloni has won,

617
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,900
as I won at all things!

618
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,840
Now, let's put more of
this liquid into our bodies.

619
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:53,310
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

620
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,310
Man, you wouldn't believe what
they charge for fuel out here.

621
00:50:56,410 --> 00:51:00,850
- I might actually lose money on this job.
- My connection is making us wait.

622
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:04,990
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

623
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:10,420
Where yours is more,
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

624
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,350
- My father didn't stress diplomacy.
- Thanos?

625
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,460
He's not my father.

626
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,530
When Thanos took my home world,
he killed my parents in front of me.

627
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:27,480
He tortured me,
turned me into a weapon.

628
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:31,620
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

629
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,150
I couldn't stand by and...

630
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,020
Why would you risk your life for this?

631
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,680
My mother gave it to me.

632
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,000
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

633
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,470
I happened to have it on me,

634
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,900
when I was...

635
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:55,470
The day that she...

636
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,640
You know, when I left Earth.

637
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,380
What do you do with it?

638
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,220
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

639
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,990
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

640
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,360
Really?

641
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,660
On my planet, there's a
legend about people like you.

642
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,300
It's called

643
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,700
Footloose.

644
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,870
And in it, a great hero

645
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,700
named Kevin Bacon,

646
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:30,300
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

647
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,410
It's the greatest thing there is.

648
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,450
Who put the sticks up their butts?

649
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:37,010
What? No, that's just a...

650
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:38,980
- That is cruel.
- It's just a phrase

651
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,740
people use.

652
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,470
The melody is pleasant!

653
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:21,330
- No!
- What the hell?

654
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:22,830
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

655
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:26,230
And I am not some starry-eyed
waif here to succumb to your...

656
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:28,530
Your pelvic sorcery!

657
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:30,500
That is not what is happening here.

658
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,440
No.

659
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,850
Stop it!

660
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:49,290
What are you doing?

661
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:52,520
This vermin speaks of affairs
he knows nothing about!

662
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,590
- That is true!
- He has no respect!

663
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,090
- That is also true!
- Hold on! Hold on!

664
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:59,360
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!

665
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,530
You just wanna laugh at
me like everyone else!

666
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:04,240
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

667
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,100
He thinks I'm some
stupid thing! He does!

668
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,610
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

669
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:11,780
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

670
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,880
and put back together, over and over

671
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,250
and turned into some...

672
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:17,420
Some little monster!

673
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,480
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

674
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,750
He called me "vermin"!

675
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:24,520
She called me "rodent"!

676
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,960
Let's see if you can laugh

677
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:29,190
after five or six good shots
to your frickin' face!

678
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:33,100
No, no, no, no!
Four billion units! Rocket!

679
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,490
Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one
more lousy night and you're rich.

680
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,030
Fine. But I can't promise,

681
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:50,680
when all this is over I'm not gonna
kill every last one of you jerks.

682
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,740
See? That's exactly why none
of you have any friends!

683
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:57,520
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

684
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:01,630
We have travelled,
halfway across the quadrant.

685
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:04,190
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

686
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:08,230
- Drax!
- Let him go.

687
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:09,990
We don't need him.

688
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,040
Milady Gamora.

689
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,400
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

690
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,550
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

691
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:27,950
We house the galaxy's
largest collection

692
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,090
of fauna, relics,
and species of all manner.

693
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,900
I present to you,

694
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,090
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

695
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:59,040
Oh, my dear Gamora.

696
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,890
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

697
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,890
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

698
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,920
We have what we discussed.

699
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:13,030
What is that thing there?

700
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:15,290
I am Groot.

701
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,640
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

702
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,640
Sir...

703
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:26,210
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

704
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:29,250
At the moment of your death, of course.

705
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,650
I am Groot.

706
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,520
Why, so he could turn
you into a frickin' chair?

707
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,080
That's your pet?

708
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,050
- His what?
- Tivan.

709
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:42,030
We have been halfway around
the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

710
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:44,230
Very well, then.

711
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:47,300
Let us see what you brought.

712
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,310
Three quarnyx batteries,
seven cases of Cotati seeds.

713
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:07,200
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

714
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:11,580
You shall send a message for me.

715
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,610
Oh, my new friends.

716
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,690
Before creation itself,

717
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,950
there were six singularities.

718
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,530
Then the universe
exploded into existence,

719
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:27,730
and the remnants of these systems

720
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:31,730
were forged into concentrated ingots.

721
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,760
Infinity Stones.

722
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,010
These stones, it seems,

723
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:38,970
can only be brandished

724
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:42,610
by beings of extraordinary strength.

725
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,200
Observe.

726
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:52,790
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

727
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:56,850
like wheat in a field.

728
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:00,620
There's a little pee coming
out of me right now.

729
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,260
Once, for a moment,

730
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:06,470
a group was able to share the
energy amongst themselves,

731
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:10,000
but even they were
quickly destroyed by it.

732
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:17,870
Beautiful.

733
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:22,150
Beyond compare.

734
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:27,980
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

735
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,890
How would you like to get paid?

736
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:33,480
What do you think, fancy man? Units!

737
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,020
Very well, then.

738
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,770
Carina.

739
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,340
Stand back.

740
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:47,210
I will no longer be your slave!

741
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,240
No!

742
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,620
What the...

743
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,400
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the Orb?

744
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,010
- What do you still have it for?
- What are we gonna do, leave it in there?

745
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:56,980
- I can't believe you had that in your purse!
- It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

746
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,750
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.
There's a chance they can contain it.

747
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:03,650
Are you kidding me?
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.

748
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:06,290
- Just give it to Ronan!
- So he can destroy the galaxy?

749
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,190
What are you,
some saint all of a sudden?

750
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:11,290
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

751
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:13,190
Because I'm one of the
idiots who lives in it!

752
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:18,070
Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow
the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands.

753
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:21,500
We have to go back to your
ship, and deliver it to Nova.

754
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,440
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

755
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:28,740
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

756
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,010
who's really nice for
a whole lot of money.

757
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:34,650
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

758
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,920
You're despicable. Dishonorable.

759
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,550
Faithless!

760
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,810
- No.
- At last!

761
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,460
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

762
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,720
You called Ronan?

763
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:56,630
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

764
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,900
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

765
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,780
Ronan the Accuser!

766
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,420
You are the one who
transmitted the message?

767
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,280
You killed my wife.

768
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,020
You killed my daughter!

769
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:24,330
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

770
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,300
It is Gamora. She is
escaping with the Orb.

771
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,280
No!

772
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,850
Nebula,

773
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,310
retrieve the Orb.

774
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,740
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

775
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:07,700
Bring it down!

776
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,040
Rocket, keep them off Gamora
until she gets to the Milano.

777
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:41,580
How? We've got no
weaponry on these things.

778
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,510
These pods are industrial grade.

779
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:44,810
They're nearly indestructible.

780
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,520
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

781
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:49,640
That's not what I'm saying.

782
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,830
Let me borrow your ride.

783
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:14,430
I don't recall killing your family.

784
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:21,140
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

785
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,590
Quill, I'm trapped.
I can't make it to the Milano.

786
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,230
I have to head out.

787
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:46,700
Wait! These things aren't
meant to go out there.

788
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:55,610
You are a disappointment, sister.

789
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,340
Of all our siblings,

790
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:00,620
I hated you least.

791
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,980
Nebula, please.

792
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,020
If Ronan gets this stone

793
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,310
- he'll kill us all.
- Not all.

794
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:09,720
You will already be dead.

795
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:07,210
Ronan, it is done.

796
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:11,310
Quill, come on.

797
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,960
Her body mods should keep her
alive a couple more minutes,

798
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,120
but there's nothing we can do for her.

799
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,790
These pods aren't
meant to be out here.

800
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:20,760
In a second, we're gonna
be in the same boat.

801
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,570
Damn it.

802
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,940
Quill?

803
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,080
Yondu! Yondu.

804
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,210
This is Quill!

805
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:39,980
- My coordinates are 227 K324.
- Quill.

806
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,320
Quill, what are you doing?

807
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:42,920
Just outside Knowhere.

808
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,610
If you're there, come get me.

809
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:47,820
I'm all yours.

810
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,230
Quill, don't be ridiculous.

811
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,770
Get back into your pod!

812
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:06,400
You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.

813
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,240
You'll die in seconds!

814
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:10,940
Quill.

815
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,700
Quill?

816
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,810
What happened?

817
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,000
I saw you out there.

818
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:23,920
I don't know what came over me.

819
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,680
But I couldn't let you die.

820
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,960
I found something inside of myself.

821
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,160
Something

822
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:36,660
incredibly heroic.

823
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:40,570
I mean, not to brag,

824
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:41,940
but, objectively...

825
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,530
Where's the Orb?

826
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:47,240
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

827
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:48,830
What?

828
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:54,010
Welcome home, Peter.

829
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:19,670
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

830
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:22,840
Quill just got himself captured.

831
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:27,320
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

832
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,110
take on a frickin' army!

833
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,080
You're right.

834
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,880
I was a fool.

835
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:41,050
All the anger,

836
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,560
all the rage,

837
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:49,030
was just to cover my loss.

838
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,980
"My wife and child are dead."

839
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:03,320
I don't care if it's mean!

840
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,750
Everybody's got dead people.

841
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:07,690
It's no excuse to get everybody else

842
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:10,150
dead along the way!

843
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:16,260
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

844
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,570
The only chance we got is to get
to the other side of the universe

845
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:21,640
as fast as we can and maybe,

846
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:26,830
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives
before that whack-job ever gets there.

847
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,240
I am Groot.

848
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:32,710
Save them? How?

849
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:35,650
I am Groot.

850
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:38,390
I know they're the only
friends that we ever had,

851
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:41,290
but there's an army of
Ravagers around them.

852
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:43,450
And there's only two of us!

853
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:45,750
Three.

854
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:56,670
You're making me

855
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:58,410
beat... up

856
01:10:58,510 --> 01:10:59,970
grass!

857
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,240
The Orb is in my possession,

858
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,450
as I promised.

859
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:08,180
Bring it to me.

860
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:12,050
Yes, that was our agreement.

861
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,060
Bring you the Orb,

862
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,760
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

863
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:22,460
However, now that I know
it contains an Infinity Stone,

864
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,670
I wonder what use I have for you.

865
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:26,500
Boy,

866
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,470
I would reconsider your current course.

867
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:32,510
Master! You cannot!

868
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:35,570
Thanos is the most powerful
being in the universe.

869
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:37,840
Not anymore.

870
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,540
You call me "boy!"

871
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:07,240
I will unfurl 1,000 years
of Kree justice on Xandar,

872
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:10,910
and burn it to its core!

873
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:13,010
Then, Thanos,

874
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:15,550
I am coming for you.

875
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:20,760
After Xandar, you are
going to kill my father?

876
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:22,760
You dare to oppose me?

877
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,660
You see what he has turned me into.

878
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:29,490
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

879
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,760
You betray me?

880
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:33,270
Steal my money?

881
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:35,270
Stop it! Leave him alone!

882
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:37,510
When I picked you up as a kid,

883
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:40,010
these boys wanted to eat you.

884
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:42,610
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

885
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,380
I saved your life!

886
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,710
Will you shut up about that? God!

887
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:49,120
Twenty years, you been
throwing that in my face,

888
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:51,920
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

889
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:55,660
Normal people don't even think
about eating someone else!

890
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,290
Much less that person
having to be grateful for it!

891
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:59,950
You abducted me, man.

892
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:02,830
You stole me from my
home and from my family.

893
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:05,470
You don't give a damn
about your Terra!

894
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:06,630
You're scared

895
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:08,840
because you're soft in here.

896
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,270
Here, right here!

897
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:11,440
Yondu!

898
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:12,740
Listen to me.

899
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,080
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

900
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,110
I know what he's got, girl.

901
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:19,550
Then you know we must get it back!

902
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:23,120
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

903
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:26,220
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

904
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,960
Is that what she's been
filling your head with, boy?

905
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,520
Sentiment?

906
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,820
Eating away your brain like maggots!

907
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:40,000
That's it.

908
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,600
No!

909
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:42,870
Sorry, boy.

910
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:46,540
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

911
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,370
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

912
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:53,050
If you kill me now,

913
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:57,670
you are saying goodbye to the
biggest score you have ever seen.

914
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:04,290
The Stone?

915
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:06,590
I hope you got something
better than that.

916
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:09,790
Because ain't nobody
stealing from Ronan.

917
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,900
We got a ringer.

918
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,900
Is that right?

919
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:17,000
She knows everything there
is to know about Ronan.

920
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,410
His ships,

921
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,110
his army.

922
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,500
He's vulnerable.

923
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,150
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?

924
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:28,270
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

925
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,050
Let him go!

926
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:40,930
You always did have a scrote, boy!

927
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:44,220
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

928
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,070
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

929
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:56,840
Attention, idiots.

930
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,320
The lunatic on top of this craft
is holding a Hadron Enforcer.

931
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:04,190
It's a weapon of my own design.

932
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:05,790
What the hell?

933
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:08,660
If you don't hand over
our companions now,

934
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,130
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.

935
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:13,060
A very big new one!

936
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,430
- I ain't buyin' it.
- I'm giving you to the count of five.

937
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:19,700
- 5, 4, 3...
- No! Wait, hold on!

938
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,640
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

939
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:23,800
We figured it out! We're fine!

940
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,560
Hey, Quill. What's going on?

941
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:28,640
You call that "figured it out"?

942
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:31,110
We're gonna rob the guys
who just beat us senseless.

943
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:32,650
You want to talk about senseless?

944
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:35,020
How about trying to save
us by blowing us up?

945
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,950
We were only gonna blow you
up if they didn't turn you over!

946
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:39,920
And how on earth were
they gonna turn us over

947
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,560
when you only gave
them a count of five?

948
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:45,160
We didn't have time to work
out the minutiae of the plan.

949
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:47,530
This is what we get for
acting altruistically.

950
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:49,800
- I am Groot.
- They are ungrateful.

951
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:53,970
What's important now is we get the
Ravagers' army to help us save Xandar.

952
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:57,840
So we can give the Stone to Yondu who's
just gonna sell to somebody even worse?

953
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:01,010
- We'll figure that part out later.
- We have to stop Ronan.

954
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:02,580
How?

955
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,250
- I have a plan.
- You've got a plan?

956
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:06,410
Yes.

957
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:08,940
First of all, you're copying me
from when I said I had a plan.

958
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,550
No, I'm not. People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

959
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:14,560
Secondly, I don't even
believe you have a plan.

960
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:17,460
I have part of a plan!

961
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,090
What percentage of
a plan do you have?

962
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:22,400
You don't get to ask questions after
the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.

963
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,130
I just saved Quill.

964
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:26,970
We've already established that you destroying
the ship that I'm on is not saving me.

965
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:29,300
- When did we establish it?
- Like three seconds ago!

966
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,430
I wasn't listening. I was
thinking of something else.

967
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:35,140
She's right. You don't get an opinion.
What percentage?

968
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,470
- I don't know. Twelve percent.
- Twelve percent?

969
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:41,220
That's a fake laugh.

970
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,050
- It's real!
- Totally fake.

971
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:47,820
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

972
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,360
- because that is not a plan.
- It's barely a concept.

973
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:53,060
- You're taking their side?
- I am Groot.

974
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,100
So what, it's better than 11%? What the
hell does that have to do with anything?

975
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,830
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

976
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:02,830
See? Groot's the only one
of you who has a clue.

977
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:08,900
Guys.

978
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,410
Come on.

979
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:12,510
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

980
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:15,580
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

981
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,850
I need your help.

982
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,860
I look around at us.

983
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,450
You know what I see?

984
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,430
Losers.

985
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:30,230
I mean, like,

986
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:32,270
folks who have lost stuff.

987
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:34,990
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

988
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:37,430
Our homes,

989
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,540
our families,

990
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:42,180
normal lives.

991
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:45,470
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

992
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,450
Today, it's given us something.

993
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:49,150
It has given us a chance.

994
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:51,050
To do what?

995
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:54,250
To give a shit.

996
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,460
For once.

997
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,030
Not run away.

998
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,900
I, for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

999
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,520
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

1000
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:11,230
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1001
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:14,310
it's impossible.

1002
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:17,170
You're asking us to die.

1003
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:25,710
Yeah, I guess I am.

1004
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,690
Quill.

1005
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:47,200
I have lived most my life
surrounded by my enemies.

1006
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:55,440
I will be grateful to
die among my friends.

1007
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:01,690
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1008
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,580
I will fight beside you.

1009
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:08,290
And in the end,

1010
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,290
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1011
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,430
I am Groot.

1012
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:34,980
What the hell. I don't got
that long a lifespan, anyway.

1013
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:43,160
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1014
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,500
We're all standing up now.

1015
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,300
Bunch of jackasses,
standing in a circle.

1016
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,640
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

1017
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:59,780
The bigger the target,
the bigger the power surge.

1018
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,120
All Ronan's got to do is touch the
Stone to the planet's surface and zap.

1019
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:04,920
All plants, animals,

1020
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:06,950
- Nova Corps.
- Everything will die.

1021
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:09,550
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1022
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,090
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole

1023
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:16,400
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1024
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:20,570
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1025
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:23,440
Won't there be hundreds of
Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1026
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:26,840
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1027
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:33,650
Once they know we're on board,

1028
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:37,150
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

1029
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,750
Which I can disable by
dismantling the power source.

1030
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:41,560
We'll make it to the flight deck,

1031
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:45,120
and I'll use the Hadron
Enforcer to kill Ronan.

1032
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:50,700
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the Stone.

1033
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,230
Use these devices to contain it.

1034
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:55,130
If you touch it,

1035
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,200
it will kill you.

1036
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:02,810
I'll contact one of the Nova
officers who arrested us.

1037
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:06,000
Hopefully, they'll believe
we're there to help.

1038
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:09,740
There's one more thing we
need to complete the plan.

1039
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:11,710
That guy's eye.

1040
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:14,760
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

1041
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:16,650
that guy's eye.

1042
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:20,350
No, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me.

1043
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,500
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,
and will arrive in T-minus

1044
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,500
fifteen minutes.

1045
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,440
Remember, boy.

1046
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:33,470
At the end of all this,

1047
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:34,910
I get the Stone.

1048
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:37,910
You cross me, we kill you all.

1049
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:01,900
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1050
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:12,250
This is a terrible plan.

1051
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:14,910
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

1052
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:20,850
Nova Prime.

1053
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,360
I received a transmission

1054
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,150
from one of the Ravagers.

1055
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,890
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

1056
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,360
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1057
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:30,730
Good God.

1058
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:32,800
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1059
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:35,370
Did he say why we should believe him?

1060
01:22:35,470 --> 01:22:37,700
He said his crew just
escaped from prison

1061
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:41,240
so he'd have no other reason to
risk coming to Xandar to help.

1062
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,200
He says that he's an

1063
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:45,110
"a-hole."

1064
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,480
But he's not,

1065
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:48,320
and I'm quoting him, here,

1066
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,720
"100% a dick."

1067
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,580
Do you believe him?

1068
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:55,820
I don't know that I believe
anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1069
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,320
I mean, do you believe
that he is here to help?

1070
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,030
Yeah.

1071
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:15,480
A fleet approaches.

1072
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,630
They appear to be Ravagers.

1073
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:29,810
Fire!

1074
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:41,940
Cover it down.

1075
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,400
Submerge!

1076
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,540
Rocket, hurry!

1077
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:05,860
All pilots, dive!

1078
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,590
They're beneath us!

1079
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:17,440
Evacuate the city.

1080
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:21,500
Our priority is to get our
people away from the battle.

1081
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:29,500
Forward thrust, now!

1082
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,060
Come on!

1083
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,320
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1084
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:10,760
Hell!

1085
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:12,360
I'm going down, Quill!

1086
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:14,260
No more games with me, boy!

1087
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,460
I'll see you

1088
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,760
at the end of this!

1089
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,470
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1090
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:27,970
We'll never make it up there!

1091
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,720
Peter Quill.

1092
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:46,260
This is Denarian Saal
of the Nova Corps.

1093
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:49,730
For the record, I advised
against trusting you here.

1094
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:51,530
They got my "dick" message!

1095
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:53,260
Prove me wrong.

1096
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,570
Yes!

1097
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,850
Yes!

1098
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:29,960
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1099
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,310
The starboard kern has been breached!

1100
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:36,710
We have been boarded.

1101
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:38,280
Continue our approach.

1102
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:39,710
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1103
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:42,480
None of that will matter
once we reach the surface.

1104
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:43,680
Seal security doors!

1105
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:45,270
Now!

1106
01:26:46,590 --> 01:26:49,320
Get out of my way!

1107
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:01,670
Oh, man.

1108
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:06,210
All Nova pilots,
interlock and form a blockade.

1109
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:10,610
The Dark Aster must
not reach the ground.

1110
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:24,320
Locked in!

1111
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,320
Locked in.

1112
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:28,930
We're locked in.

1113
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:09,360
I can barely see.

1114
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:37,460
When did you learn to do that?

1115
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,730
Pretty sure the answer is

1116
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:40,860
"I am Groot."

1117
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:44,540
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1118
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:51,140
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

1119
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,940
It is pleasing to once again have

1120
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,550
friends.

1121
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:59,050
You, Quill, are my friend.

1122
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:00,420
Thanks.

1123
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:03,080
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

1124
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:08,060
- And this green whore, she, too...
- You must stop!

1125
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:16,100
Gamora, look at what you have done.
You have always been weak.

1126
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,760
You stupid, traitorous...

1127
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:26,270
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1128
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:31,270
Head to the flight deck. I'll shut
down the power to the security doors.

1129
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:40,690
Yondu Udonta.

1130
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:44,750
Order your men to turn
on the Nova Corps.

1131
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,680
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1132
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:05,050
Time to die...

1133
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:38,770
Nebula, please.

1134
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:55,640
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1135
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:58,260
enact immolation initiative.

1136
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:02,840
They're dive-bombing the city!

1137
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:04,780
Denarian Saal,
should we break formation?

1138
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,970
No! Hold your positions.

1139
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:39,650
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1140
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:41,380
We'll take care of the
people down here.

1141
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:44,110
I can't believe I'm taking
orders from a hamster.

1142
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:48,450
Star-Lord.

1143
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,020
Finally.

1144
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:01,990
You thief!

1145
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:16,710
You will never make it to Ronan.

1146
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:24,720
Everybody shoot them
before they hit the ground.

1147
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,730
Come on!

1148
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:21,050
Finger to the throat means death.

1149
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:27,890
Metaphor.

1150
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:29,320
Yeah, sorta.

1151
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:31,050
No.

1152
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:00,450
Xandar!

1153
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:03,710
You stand accused.

1154
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:07,160
Your wretched peace treaty will not

1155
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:08,860
save you now.

1156
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:12,660
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1157
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:37,890
Rocket!

1158
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:40,220
Hold on, Saal, just...

1159
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:07,790
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1160
01:35:07,890 --> 01:35:09,520
The city's been evacuated,

1161
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:12,190
but we're getting our
asses kicked down here.

1162
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:14,190
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1163
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:39,920
Nebula!

1164
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:43,620
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1165
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:45,560
You know he's crazy.

1166
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:47,760
I know you're both crazy.

1167
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:49,490
No!

1168
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:53,400
What the?

1169
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,190
Get out!

1170
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:38,610
You did it!

1171
01:37:04,670 --> 01:37:05,940
I was mistaken.

1172
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:08,100
I do remember your family.

1173
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:10,080
Their screams were

1174
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:12,740
pitiful. I...

1175
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:10,990
No, Groot!

1176
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:12,230
You can't.

1177
01:39:12,330 --> 01:39:14,260
You'll die.

1178
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:16,270
Why are you doing this?

1179
01:39:16,370 --> 01:39:18,300
Why?

1180
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,350
We

1181
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:27,930
are

1182
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:30,050
Groot.

1183
01:40:34,010 --> 01:40:36,500
I called him an idiot.

1184
01:40:58,770 --> 01:41:01,170
You killed Groot!

1185
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,610
Behold!

1186
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:10,520
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1187
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:13,050
What fruit have they wrought?

1188
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:17,260
Only that my father and his father

1189
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:20,990
shall finally know vengeance.

1190
01:41:21,090 --> 01:41:23,790
People of Xandar,

1191
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,770
the time has come

1192
01:41:25,870 --> 01:41:28,730
to rejoice and renounce

1193
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:31,530
your paltry gods!

1194
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:35,700
Your salvation is at hand.

1195
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:49,950
Listen to these words.

1196
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,690
Now bring it down hard!

1197
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:05,140
What are you doing?

1198
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:08,260
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

1199
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:13,110
Gamora.

1200
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:16,080
Subtle. Take it back.

1201
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:18,620
What are you doing?

1202
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:21,520
I'm distracting you,
you big turd blossom.

1203
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:39,260
No!

1204
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:16,370
Peter! Take my hand!

1205
01:43:21,310 --> 01:43:23,780
Take my hand, Peter.

1206
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:26,050
Mom.

1207
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:28,680
Take my hand!

1208
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:24,680
You're mortal!

1209
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:26,110
How?

1210
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:28,410
You said it yourself, bitch.

1211
01:44:28,510 --> 01:44:31,350
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1212
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:02,410
Well, well, well.

1213
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:04,040
Quite the light show.

1214
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:08,010
Ain't this sweet.

1215
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:11,660
But you got some business to attend to

1216
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,660
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1217
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:18,130
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1218
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:22,330
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1219
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:26,660
but the only way the universe can survive
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1220
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,670
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1221
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,810
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1222
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:37,010
Hand it over, son.

1223
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:54,870
Yondu.

1224
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:01,230
Do not open that Orb.
You know that, right?

1225
01:46:01,410 --> 01:46:04,340
You've seen what it does to people.

1226
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:17,320
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1227
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:20,360
It's probably good we didn't
deliver him to his dad

1228
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:21,460
like we was hired to do.

1229
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:24,760
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1230
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:33,200
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

1231
01:46:35,470 --> 01:46:37,770
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1232
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:40,670
I know.

1233
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,170
But he was about the only family I had.

1234
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:48,110
No.

1235
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:50,580
He wasn't.

1236
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:39,940
Why would you even know this?

1237
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,780
When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

1238
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,740
so we had it checked out.

1239
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:47,280
I'm not Terran?

1240
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:48,950
You are half Terran.

1241
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:52,750
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

1242
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:56,620
he's something very ancient
we've never seen here before.

1243
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:00,750
That could be why you were able to
hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1244
01:48:01,190 --> 01:48:02,660
Your friends have arrived.

1245
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:06,670
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1246
01:48:06,770 --> 01:48:12,360
we'd like to express our profound
gratitude for your help in saving Xandar.

1247
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:16,510
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1248
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:20,370
- he has something to show you.
- Thank you, Nova Prime.

1249
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:33,630
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

1250
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:34,960
Yes.

1251
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:37,430
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1252
01:48:37,730 --> 01:48:40,360
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1253
01:48:42,570 --> 01:48:45,800
We tried to keep it as close
to the original as possible.

1254
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:48,370
We salvaged as much as we could.

1255
01:48:51,010 --> 01:48:52,480
I...

1256
01:48:54,010 --> 01:48:55,570
Thank you.

1257
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:58,750
I have a family.

1258
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:00,780
They're alive because of you.

1259
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:07,460
Your criminal records
have also been expunged.

1260
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:11,960
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

1261
01:49:12,130 --> 01:49:14,430
Question. What if I see
something that I want to take,

1262
01:49:14,530 --> 01:49:17,200
- and it belongs to someone else?
- You will be arrested.

1263
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:19,910
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1264
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:21,810
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

1265
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:24,640
No, I want it more, sir. Do you
understand? What are you laughing at?

1266
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:26,580
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1267
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:28,580
What if someone does
something irksome

1268
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,340
and I decide to remove his spine?

1269
01:49:32,450 --> 01:49:34,010
That's...

1270
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:37,310
That's actually murder.

1271
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:41,260
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1272
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:44,660
So... also illegal.

1273
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:49,290
They'll be fine, Dey.

1274
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:50,770
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1275
01:49:50,870 --> 01:49:52,340
You?

1276
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:58,780
Yeah. Me.

1277
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:19,290
Peter,

1278
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:23,200
I know these last few months
have been hard for you.

1279
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:26,710
But I'm going to a better place.

1280
01:50:26,810 --> 01:50:29,310
And I will be okay.

1281
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:33,610
And I will always be with you.

1282
01:50:34,850 --> 01:50:37,580
You are the light of my life.

1283
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:40,380
My precious son.

1284
01:50:40,890 --> 01:50:44,290
My little Star-Lord.

1285
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,990
Love, Mom.

1286
01:52:47,110 --> 01:52:48,980
So, what should we do next?

1287
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:50,550
Something good?

1288
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,620
Something bad?

1289
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:54,810
A bit of both?

1290
01:52:55,990 --> 01:52:59,350
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.

1291
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:02,650
Bit of both.

1292
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:29,300
What do you let it lick you like that for?

1293
02:00:30,170 --> 02:00:32,200
Gross.

1294
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:36,350
Yeah!

1295
02:00:36,350 --> 02:00:38,640
But it burns going down.

1295
02:00:39,305 --> 02:00:45,931
