1
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:13,634
The Hovitos are near.

2
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:19,320
The poison is still fresh. Three days.
They're following us.

3
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:24,518
If they knew we were here,
they would have killed us already.

4
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:48,633
This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.

5
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:53,156
- A friend of yours?
- A competitor. He was good.

6
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:58,722
- He was very, very good.
- Señor, nobody's come out alive.

7
00:03:58,924 --> 00:04:00,482
Please.

8
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:37,477
Señor...

9
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:07,962
Stop. Stay out of the light.

10
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:31,441
Forrestal.

11
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:19,194
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

12
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,034
That's what scares me.

13
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:43,641
- Stay here.
- If you insist, señor.

14
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:09,880
- Give me the whip.
- Throw me the idol.

15
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:14,516
No time to argue.
Throw the idol, I throw the whip.

16
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:18,922
- Give me the whip!
- Adiós, señor.

17
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:00,843
Adiós.

18
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:45,436
Dr Jones, there is nothing you can
possess which I cannot take away.

19
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:49,398
And you thought I had given up.

20
00:09:58,324 --> 00:10:03,079
You chose the wrong friends.
This time it will cost you.

21
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:09,680
Too bad the Hovitos don't know you
the way I do, Belloq.

22
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:16,039
Yes, too bad. You could warn them,
if only you spoke Hovitos.

23
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:03,802
Jock! Start the engines! Get it up!

24
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:12,355
Jock, the engines!
Start the engines, Jock!

25
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:02,117
There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!

26
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:04,963
That's just my pet snake, Reggie.

27
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:08,361
I hate snakes, Jock. I hate them!

28
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:11,601
Come on,
show a little backbone, will you!

29
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:30,794
"Neo", meaning "new", and "Iithic",

30
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:35,236
I-T-H-l-C, meaning "stone".

31
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:38,481
Let's get back
to Turkdean barrow near Hazelton.

32
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:43,758
It contains a central passage
and three chambers, or cists...

33
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:50,399
Don't confuse that with robbing,

34
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,438
which means the removal
of the barrow's contents.

35
00:12:54,644 --> 00:13:00,674
This site also demonstrates...one
of the great dangers of archaeology,

36
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:04,115
not to life and limb,
though that does happen too...

37
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:06,519
No, I'm talking about folklore.

38
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:11,514
Local tradition held that there was
a golden coffin buried at the site.

39
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:16,752
This accounts for the holes dug all over
and the poor condition of the find.

40
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,797
However, chamber 3 was undisturbed.

41
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:23,201
The undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods found...

42
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:25,514
...in the area give us...

43
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:36,522
...reason to date this find as we have.
Any questions, then?

44
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,999
No, OK. That's it for the day, then.

45
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:45,442
Don't forget Michaelson,
chapters four and five for next time.

46
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:49,922
I will be in my office on Thursday,
but not Wednesday.

47
00:13:57,724 --> 00:14:01,194
I had it, Marcus. I had it in my hand.

48
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:03,759
- What happened?
- Guess.

49
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:06,922
- Belloq?
- Want to hear about it?

50
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:10,002
No. I'm sure everything
you do for the museum

51
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:13,162
conforms to the
Treaty for the Protection of Antiquities.

52
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:18,996
It's beautiful. I can get it. He can only
sell it in Marrakech. I need $2,000.

53
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:22,640
Listen, old boy,
I've brought some people to see you.

54
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:27,315
- I've got these pieces. Good pieces.
- Indiana...

55
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:31,119
The museum will buy them, as usual.
Yes, they are nice.

56
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:35,078
- Worth a ticket to Marrakech.
- The people are waiting.

57
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:37,878
- What people?
- Army lntelligence.

58
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:41,360
They knew you were coming.
They know everything.

59
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:45,000
- I don't know what they want.
- Why should I see them?

60
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:46,717
Am I in trouble?

61
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:51,238
Dr Jones, we've heard a great deal
about you.

62
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:55,039
Professor of Archaeology,
expert on the occult,

63
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:59,681
and - how does one say it? -
obtainer of rare antiquities.

64
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:03,479
That's one way of saying it.
Why don't you sit down?

65
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:06,835
Yes, you're a man of many talents.

66
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:10,832
You studied under
Professor Ravenwood in Chicago?

67
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:15,560
- Yes, I did.
- You've no idea of his whereabouts?

68
00:15:16,844 --> 00:15:20,393
Just rumours really.
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

69
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:24,643
I haven't spoken to him for ten years.
We were friends, but...

70
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:27,881
...had a bit of a falling out, I'm afraid.

71
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:33,556
Dr Jones, you must understand
that this is all strictly confidential.

72
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:36,676
I understand.

73
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:42,720
Yesterday, our European sections
intercepted a German communiqué

74
00:15:42,924 --> 00:15:45,722
that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.

75
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:50,315
The Nazis have teams of archaeologists
running around the world

76
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:53,402
Iooking for religious artefacts.

77
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:57,961
Hitler's a nut on the subject, crazy.
He's obsessed with the occult.

78
00:15:58,164 --> 00:16:04,433
There's a German archaeological dig
going on in the desert outside Cairo.

79
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:09,195
We've got some information,
but we can't decipher it. Maybe you can.

80
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:16,082
"Tanis development proceeding.
Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

81
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:19,401
"Abner Ravenwood, US."

82
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,834
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

83
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:25,081
What does Tanis mean to you?

84
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:31,234
It's a possible resting place of
the Lost Ark. The Ark of the Covenant.

85
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:35,119
The chest the Hebrews
carried the Ten Commandments in.

86
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:38,441
- The Ten Commandments?
- The actual Commandments.

87
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:42,478
The tablets Moses brought down
from Mount Horeb and smashed,

88
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:47,633
if you believe in that sort of thing.
Ever go to Sunday school?

89
00:16:47,844 --> 00:16:52,793
The Hebrews put the broken pieces
in the Ark. When they settled in Canaan,

90
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:56,235
- they put it in the Temple of Solomon.
- In Jerusalem.

91
00:16:56,444 --> 00:17:00,232
Where it stayed for many years,
until, whoosh, it's gone.

92
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:03,675
- Where?
- Nobody knows where or when.

93
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:09,117
An Egyptian Pharaoh, Shishak,
invaded Jerusalem about 980 BC,

94
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:12,043
and may have taken
the Ark to the city of Tanis

95
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:16,760
and hidden it in a secret chamber
called the Well of Souls.

96
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:20,354
About a year after
the Pharaoh returned to Egypt,

97
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:26,673
the city of Tanis was consumed by
the desert in a year-long sandstorm.

98
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:30,001
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

99
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:40,754
Not really. Ravenwood is the real expert.

100
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:45,515
Abner did the first serious work on Tanis.
Collected some of its relics.

101
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:49,433
It was his obsession.
But he never found the city.

102
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:52,954
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr Ravenwood,

103
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:56,520
being mentioned so prominently
in a secret Nazi cable.

104
00:17:56,724 --> 00:18:01,479
- Rubbish. Ravenwood's no Nazi.
- Why do they want him, then?

105
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:07,122
They want the Staff of Ra headpiece
and they think Abner's got it.

106
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:09,758
What is the Staff of Ra headpiece?

107
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:15,675
The Staff is just a stick about this big,
nobody knows for sure how high.

108
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:19,593
It's capped with an elaborate headpiece

109
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:23,114
in the shape of the sun,
with a central crystal.

110
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:29,763
You'd take the Staff to a map room
with a miniature of the city on the floor.

111
00:18:29,964 --> 00:18:33,001
If you put the Staff in a certain place
at a certain time,

112
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:38,403
the sun shone through here
and made a beam on the floor,

113
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:41,164
giving the location of the Well of Souls.

114
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:45,835
- Where the Ark was kept.
- Which is what the Nazis are seeking.

115
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,922
What does this Ark look like?

116
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:52,962
There's a picture of it right here.

117
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:58,355
That's it.

118
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:09,120
- Good God!
- That's what the Hebrews thought.

119
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:11,679
What's that coming out of there?

120
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:17,197
Lightning. Fire.
The power of God or something.

121
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:22,959
I'm beginning to understand
Hitler's interest in this.

122
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:28,761
The Bible speaks of the Ark
laying waste to entire regions.

123
00:19:28,964 --> 00:19:32,718
An army which carries the Ark before it...

124
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:35,074
...is invincible.

125
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:55,960
You did it, didn't you?

126
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:59,600
- They want you to go for it.
- Oh, Marcus!

127
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:04,639
They want you to get the Ark before
the Nazis do and they'll pay handsomely.

128
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:08,803
And the museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

129
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:17,480
- The Ark of the Covenant...
- Nothing else has come close.

130
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:22,155
It represents everything
we got into archaeology for.

131
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:29,640
Five years ago, I would've gone after it
myself. I'm rather envious.

132
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:34,122
I've got to locate Abner.
I think I know where to start.

133
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:42,203
- Suppose she'll still be with him?
- Possibly.

134
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:45,953
Marion's the least of your worries,
believe me, lndy.

135
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:48,075
What do you mean?

136
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:54,519
For nearly three thousand years,
Man has been searching for the lost Ark.

137
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:58,034
Not something to be taken lightly.

138
00:20:58,244 --> 00:21:01,316
No one knows its secrets.

139
00:21:02,284 --> 00:21:05,560
It's like nothing
you've ever gone after before.

140
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,723
Are you trying to scare me?
You sound like my mother.

141
00:21:09,924 --> 00:21:14,634
We've known each other for a long time.
I don't believe in hocus-pocus.

142
00:21:14,844 --> 00:21:19,599
I'm after a find of historical significance,
you're talking about the boogieman.

143
00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:23,638
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

144
00:21:32,604 --> 00:21:34,720
Nice to see you again, Dr Jones.

145
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:29,598
Hello, Marion.

146
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:37,598
Indiana Jones.

147
00:24:39,924 --> 00:24:43,360
Always knew someday
you'd walk back through my door.

148
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:47,443
I never doubted that.
Something made it inevitable.

149
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:50,238
What are you doing here in Nepal?

150
00:24:50,444 --> 00:24:53,117
I need a piece your father collected.

151
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:57,283
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.

152
00:24:57,484 --> 00:25:02,683
- I never meant to hurt you.
- I was a child in love. It was wrong.

153
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:07,321
- You knew what you were doing.
- Now I do. This is my place. Get out!

154
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:15,079
You needn't be happy about what I did,
but maybe we can help each other now.

155
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:21,357
I need one of the pieces your father
collected. Bronze piece, about this size.

156
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:25,557
- Know the one I mean?
- Yeah, I know it.

157
00:25:25,764 --> 00:25:28,597
Where's Abner?

158
00:25:30,004 --> 00:25:31,995
Abner's dead.

159
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:40,999
- Marion, I'm sorry.
- Do you know what you did to my life?

160
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:45,561
- I can only say sorry so many times.
- Say it again anyway.

161
00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:48,836
- Sorry.
- Yeah, everybody's sorry.

162
00:25:49,044 --> 00:25:52,002
Abner was sorry for taking me
to look for his junk,

163
00:25:52,204 --> 00:25:55,162
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.

164
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:57,753
Everybody's sorry for something.

165
00:25:57,964 --> 00:26:02,116
It's a worthless bronze medallion.
Are you going to give it to me?

166
00:26:02,324 --> 00:26:07,034
- I don't know where it is.
- Maybe you could find it.

167
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:10,122
3,000 bucks.

168
00:26:10,324 --> 00:26:13,794
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

169
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:18,282
I can get you another two
in the States. It's important.

170
00:26:19,484 --> 00:26:21,361
Trust me.

171
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:27,233
You know the piece I mean?
You know where it is?

172
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:31,760
- Come back tomorrow.
- Why?

173
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:35,481
Because I said so, that's why.

174
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:46,354
See you tomorrow, lndiana Jones.

175
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:53,993
- Good evening, Fräulein.
- The bar's closed.

176
00:27:54,204 --> 00:27:58,800
We are not thirsty.

177
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:03,077
- What do you want?
- The same thing Dr Jones wanted.

178
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:07,721
Surely he told you there'd be
other interested parties?

179
00:28:07,924 --> 00:28:10,233
It must've slipped his mind.

180
00:28:10,444 --> 00:28:13,197
The man is nefarious.

181
00:28:13,404 --> 00:28:17,363
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

182
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:24,276
- Why? Are you willing to offer more?
- Almost certainly. Do you still have it?

183
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:33,963
No, but I know where it is.

184
00:28:35,324 --> 00:28:37,679
How about a drink?

185
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:45,199
Your fire is dying here. Why don't you
tell me where the piece is right now?

186
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:51,923
Listen, Herr Mac, I don't know
who you're used to dealing with,

187
00:28:52,124 --> 00:28:57,596
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.

188
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:01,433
Let me show you what I am used to.

189
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:06,842
Take your hands off me!

190
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:11,237
Take your lousy hands off!

191
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:19,274
Wait! I can be reasonable.

192
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:22,601
- That time is past.
- You don't need that.

193
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:27,080
Wait.

194
00:29:27,284 --> 00:29:29,479
I'll tell you everything.

195
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,482
Yes, I know you will.

196
00:29:38,924 --> 00:29:40,915
Let her go.

197
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:53,401
Whisky.

198
00:31:01,204 --> 00:31:04,082
Shoot them. Shoot them both.

199
00:31:57,244 --> 00:31:59,200
My medallion!

200
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:10,036
At least you haven't forgotten
how to show a lady a good time.

201
00:32:10,244 --> 00:32:12,678
- You're something!
- Tell you what...

202
00:32:12,884 --> 00:32:16,957
Until I get back my $5,000, you're getting
more than you bargained for.

203
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:19,632
I'm your goddamn partner!

204
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:57,480
Cairo, city of the living.

205
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,915
A paradise on earth.

206
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:05,396
Why do you forget yourselves?
What is this?

207
00:33:05,604 --> 00:33:08,198
Where did this animal come from?

208
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:12,202
Oh, no.

209
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:18,239
Cute. What an adorable creature.

210
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:21,958
Then it shall be welcome in our house.

211
00:33:22,164 --> 00:33:25,395
You don't have to keep it
just because of me.

212
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:36,440
I knew the Germans would hire you,
Sallah. You're the best digger in Egypt.

213
00:33:36,644 --> 00:33:42,355
My services are inconsequential to them.
They've hired every digger in Cairo.

214
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:45,237
The excavation is enormous.

215
00:33:45,444 --> 00:33:51,041
They hire strong backs and pay pennies.
It's as if the Pharaohs had returned.

216
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:54,361
- When did they find the map room?
- Three days ago.

217
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:58,762
They have not one brain among them.
Except one...

218
00:33:58,964 --> 00:34:02,513
He's very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.

219
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:07,283
- What's his name?
- They call him Bellosh.

220
00:34:12,324 --> 00:34:14,394
Belloq. Belloq.

221
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:18,040
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

222
00:34:18,244 --> 00:34:21,600
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

223
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:24,557
They're not going to find it without this.

224
00:34:25,884 --> 00:34:28,557
Who can tell us about these markings?

225
00:34:30,084 --> 00:34:33,520
Perhaps a man I know can help us.

226
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:39,639
Indy, there's something that troubles me.

227
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,563
What is it?

228
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,720
The Ark.

229
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:50,123
If it is there at Tanis, it is something
Man was not meant to disturb.

230
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:54,875
Death has always surrounded it.
It is not of this earth.

231
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:58,237
- Do we need the monkey?
- I'm surprised at you.

232
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:01,004
Talking that way about our baby.

233
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:05,402
- He's got your looks, too.
- And your brains.

234
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:09,916
I noticed that.
She's a smart little thing. Smart.

235
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:17,440
- Where are you going?
- She'll be all right. Have a date.

236
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,557
Come on, come on... Marion!

237
00:35:22,764 --> 00:35:26,279
- What's this?
- It's a date. You eat them.

238
00:36:13,244 --> 00:36:17,442
Why haven't you settled down
and had nine kids like Sallah?

239
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:20,522
Who says I haven't?

240
00:36:20,724 --> 00:36:23,443
I do. Dad had you figured long ago.

241
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:35,077
- He said you were a bum.
- That's generous.

242
00:36:35,284 --> 00:36:39,163
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
He loved you.

243
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,959
- Took a lot for you to alienate him.
- Just you.

244
00:36:59,524 --> 00:37:02,197
Marion, get out of here! Duck!

245
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:43,438
Right!

246
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,124
Help! Over here, lndy!

247
00:38:55,324 --> 00:38:57,838
Get out of the way! Move it!

248
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:01,637
Help me!

249
00:39:05,284 --> 00:39:08,435
You can't do this to me.
I'm an American.

250
00:39:13,804 --> 00:39:16,443
Indiana Jones! Help me, Jones!

251
00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:26,681
Marion...

252
00:41:29,564 --> 00:41:31,919
You looking for me?

253
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:42,358
- Belloq.
- Good afternoon, Dr Jones.

254
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:46,637
- I ought to kill you now.
- Not a very private place for a murder.

255
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:50,352
They don't care if we kill each other.

256
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:53,556
They're not gonna interfere
in our business.

257
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:58,235
It was not I who brought the girl into this.
Sit down before you fall down.

258
00:41:58,444 --> 00:42:01,754
We can at least
behave like civilised people.

259
00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:14,522
I see your taste
in friends hasn't changed.

260
00:42:14,724 --> 00:42:19,240
Odd that it should end this way,
after so many stimulating encounters.

261
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:24,472
Where shall I find a new adversary
so close to my own level?

262
00:42:24,684 --> 00:42:27,482
Try the local sewer.

263
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:34,397
You and I are very much alike.
Archaeology is our religion.

264
00:42:34,604 --> 00:42:38,563
Yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith.

265
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,915
Our methods do not differ
as much as you pretend.

266
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:47,994
I'm a shadowy reflection of you. It would
take only a nudge to make you like me.

267
00:42:48,204 --> 00:42:53,676
- To push you out of the light.
- Now you're getting nasty.

268
00:42:53,884 --> 00:42:57,559
You know it's true. How nice.

269
00:42:57,764 --> 00:43:03,760
Look at this. It's worthless.
$1 0 from a street vendor.

270
00:43:03,964 --> 00:43:08,560
Bury it in the sand for a thousand years
and it becomes priceless.

271
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:14,760
Like the Ark. Men will kill for it.
Men like you and me.

272
00:43:14,964 --> 00:43:18,195
What about your boss, der Führer?

273
00:43:18,404 --> 00:43:21,521
I thought he was waiting
to take possession.

274
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:26,115
All in good time,
when I'm finished with it.

275
00:43:26,324 --> 00:43:29,600
Jones, do you realise what the Ark is?

276
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:34,275
It's a transmitter.
It's a radio for speaking to God.

277
00:43:34,484 --> 00:43:37,760
And it's within my reach.

278
00:43:37,964 --> 00:43:41,240
You want to talk to God?

279
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:44,720
Let's go see him together.
I've nothing better to do.

280
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:51,039
Uncle lndy! Come back home now!

281
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:57,718
Next time, lndiana Jones,
it'll take more than children to save you.

282
00:44:12,644 --> 00:44:18,560
I thought I would find you there.
Better than the US Marines, eh?

283
00:44:26,404 --> 00:44:31,637
- Marion's dead.
- Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

284
00:44:31,844 --> 00:44:36,122
Life goes on, lndy. There is the truth!

285
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:42,923
I have much to tell you.
First, we'll take them home.

286
00:44:43,124 --> 00:44:46,116
Then I will take you to the old man.

287
00:45:33,724 --> 00:45:37,797
How did Belloq do it?
Where'd he get a copy of the headpiece?

288
00:45:38,004 --> 00:45:41,076
There are no pictures,
no duplicates anywhere.

289
00:45:41,284 --> 00:45:43,639
I tell you only what I saw myself.

290
00:45:43,844 --> 00:45:47,632
A headpiece like that one,
except the edges were rougher.

291
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:50,597
In the centre,
the Frenchman had a crystal,

292
00:45:50,804 --> 00:45:57,642
and surrounding the crystal on one side
were raised markings, like that one.

293
00:45:58,724 --> 00:46:02,000
They made the calculations
in the map room?

294
00:46:02,204 --> 00:46:05,674
This morning.
Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich.

295
00:46:05,884 --> 00:46:11,754
When they came out, they gave us a
new spot to dig in, away from the camp.

296
00:46:12,484 --> 00:46:17,512
- The Well of Souls, huh?
- Come, come, look here.

297
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:23,003
- Sit down, come, sit down.
- What is it?

298
00:46:23,204 --> 00:46:27,117
This is a warning
not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.

299
00:46:27,324 --> 00:46:30,794
Did Belloq get the height
of the Staff from here?

300
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:36,442
Yes, it is here. This was the old way.
This means six kadam high.

301
00:46:36,644 --> 00:46:39,283
- About 72 inches.
- Wait!

302
00:46:41,244 --> 00:46:48,002
And take back one kadam to honour
the Hebrew God whose Ark this is.

303
00:46:59,604 --> 00:47:04,041
You said their headpiece only had
markings on one side. You sure?

304
00:47:05,084 --> 00:47:10,761
Belloq's staff is too long.
They're digging in the wrong place!

305
00:47:11,844 --> 00:47:16,713
I am the monarch of the sea
I am the ruler of the...

306
00:47:26,564 --> 00:47:29,158
Bad dates.

307
00:47:42,844 --> 00:47:47,042
I told you not to be premature
in your communiqué to Berlin.

308
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:52,841
Archaeology is not an exact science.
It does not deal in time schedules.

309
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:57,834
The Führer is not patient. He demands
constant reports and expects progress.

310
00:47:58,044 --> 00:48:00,478
- You led me to believe...
- Nothing!

311
00:48:00,684 --> 00:48:02,993
I only said it looked very favourable.

312
00:48:03,204 --> 00:48:07,356
Besides, with the information we have,
my calculations were correct.

313
00:48:07,564 --> 00:48:10,681
They're not kidding, are they?

314
00:48:10,884 --> 00:48:15,036
- When does the sun hit the map room?
- About 9 in the morning.

315
00:48:15,244 --> 00:48:17,200
Not much time, then.

316
00:48:17,404 --> 00:48:20,362
- Where are they digging for the Well?
- On that ridge.

317
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,283
- But the map room is over there.
- Let's go!

318
00:52:20,232 --> 00:52:22,109
Sallah?

319
00:52:22,912 --> 00:52:24,948
Sallah!

320
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:47,911
What is the matter?
I'll fetch you water, I shall get it for you.

321
00:52:49,392 --> 00:52:52,145
I will get you water. How is the food?

322
00:53:06,232 --> 00:53:10,703
I thought you were dead.
They must've switched baskets.

323
00:53:13,592 --> 00:53:16,709
- Are you hurt?
- No. Get me out of here.

324
00:53:16,912 --> 00:53:20,951
They'll be back any minute.
Cut me loose, quick.

325
00:53:21,152 --> 00:53:25,145
They keep asking about you.
What you know.

326
00:53:28,152 --> 00:53:30,382
What's wrong? Cut me loose.

327
00:53:30,592 --> 00:53:33,902
- I know where the Ark is.
- The Ark's here?

328
00:53:34,112 --> 00:53:36,865
I'm coming with you. Get me out of here!

329
00:53:37,072 --> 00:53:39,984
If I take you now,
they'll start looking for us.

330
00:53:40,192 --> 00:53:43,548
Get me out of here! Are you crazy?

331
00:53:44,352 --> 00:53:50,587
I hate to do this, but if you don't keep
quiet, this whole thing's going to be shot.

332
00:53:51,632 --> 00:53:54,510
I'll be back to get you.

333
00:54:38,472 --> 00:54:39,746
That's it.

334
00:54:40,952 --> 00:54:46,310
Perhaps the Ark is waiting in some
antechamber for us to discover.

335
00:54:46,512 --> 00:54:49,390
Perhaps there's some
vital evidence eluding us.

336
00:54:49,592 --> 00:54:53,505
- Perhaps the girl can help us.
- My feeling exactly.

337
00:54:53,712 --> 00:54:58,945
She kept the original for years. She may
know much if properly motivated.

338
00:54:59,152 --> 00:55:01,666
I tell you the girl knows nothing.

339
00:55:01,872 --> 00:55:05,501
I'm surprised you're squeamish.
That's not your reputation.

340
00:55:05,712 --> 00:55:09,227
It needn't concern you.
I have just the man for the job.

341
00:56:35,112 --> 00:56:38,070
Indy, here, we've hit stone.

342
00:56:41,992 --> 00:56:45,541
Clear it off. Come on, find the edges.

343
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:03,312
Good, good, good. You see, lndy?

344
00:57:03,512 --> 00:57:08,870
- OK, bring the pry-bars in.
- As a team, boys, as a team!

345
00:57:09,072 --> 00:57:11,461
Push!

346
00:57:14,952 --> 00:57:19,821
Get 'em in there. Get 'em under.
That's it. Watch your toes!

347
00:57:26,912 --> 00:57:29,426
Carefully, carefully.

348
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:41,942
Sorry, lndy.

349
00:57:43,272 --> 00:57:46,821
Indy, why does the floor move?

350
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:51,221
Give me your torch.

351
00:58:19,392 --> 00:58:22,941
Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?

352
00:58:26,552 --> 00:58:30,101
Asps. Very dangerous.

353
00:58:31,872 --> 00:58:34,340
You go first.

354
00:58:52,032 --> 00:58:56,423
To escape on foot, the desert
is three weeks in every direction.

355
00:58:56,632 --> 00:58:58,702
So please eat something.

356
00:59:05,272 --> 00:59:07,547
I must apologise for your treatment.

357
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:11,950
No food, no water. What kind
of people are these friends of yours?

358
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:16,464
At this point in my work,
they are necessary evils.

359
00:59:16,672 --> 00:59:20,904
They're not my friends.
However, with the right connections,

360
00:59:21,112 --> 00:59:25,788
even in this part of the world,
we are not entirely uncivilised.

361
00:59:26,952 --> 00:59:31,707
- Beautiful.
- I would very much like to see you in it.

362
00:59:33,312 --> 00:59:35,951
I'll bet you would.

363
00:59:39,072 --> 00:59:41,188
All right.

364
00:59:48,432 --> 00:59:51,549
What have you got to drink around here?

365
00:59:53,072 --> 00:59:55,832
We don't have much time.
Soon they'll harm you.

366
00:59:55,832 --> 00:59:56,503
We don't have much time.
Soon they'll harm you.

367
00:59:56,712 --> 01:00:03,265
I won't be able to stop them, unless you
give me something to placate them.

368
01:00:03,472 --> 01:00:09,229
Some piece of information which
I can use to protect you from them.

369
01:00:09,432 --> 01:00:13,550
I've already told you everything.
I have no loyalty to Jones.

370
01:00:13,752 --> 01:00:16,027
He's brought me nothing but trouble.

371
01:00:22,592 --> 01:00:25,060
Marion, you are beautiful.

372
01:00:29,272 --> 01:00:31,740
I don't think we need a chaperone.

373
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:38,149
Steadily... Steadily!

374
01:00:40,592 --> 01:00:44,983
Down, down. Carefully, carefully.

375
01:00:45,192 --> 01:00:47,626
You all right, lndy?

376
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:53,187
Gently, boys, gently, gently.

377
01:01:11,512 --> 01:01:13,662
I told you it would be all right.

378
01:01:38,472 --> 01:01:40,986
Sallah, get down here.

379
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:01,067
You pour.

380
01:03:49,872 --> 01:03:52,511
That's good.

381
01:03:53,952 --> 01:03:55,908
Whoops!

382
01:04:01,472 --> 01:04:04,509
What is this stuff, René?

383
01:04:04,712 --> 01:04:08,910
I grew up with this. It's my family label.

384
01:04:37,112 --> 01:04:40,343
Well, I have to be going now, René.

385
01:04:42,832 --> 01:04:45,107
I like you, René, very much.

386
01:04:45,312 --> 01:04:48,702
Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.

387
01:04:52,552 --> 01:04:55,703
We meet again, Fräulein.

388
01:04:55,912 --> 01:04:59,029
You Americans, you are all the same.

389
01:05:00,072 --> 01:05:03,587
Always over-dressing
for the wrong occasions.

390
01:05:32,752 --> 01:05:34,708
Now...

391
01:05:37,152 --> 01:05:39,029
...what shall we talk about?

392
01:06:53,832 --> 01:06:56,824
All right, take it up.

393
01:06:57,032 --> 01:06:58,988
Easy!

394
01:07:00,152 --> 01:07:04,384
- You're as stubborn as that girl.
- You like her too much.

395
01:07:04,592 --> 01:07:07,789
Your methods of archaeology
are too primitive for me.

396
01:07:07,992 --> 01:07:13,703
You would use a bulldozer
to find a china cup.

397
01:07:17,472 --> 01:07:18,825
Wake your men!

398
01:07:19,032 --> 01:07:23,469
- Indy, the torches are burning out.
- Go on, get out of here.

399
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:45,862
- Sallah.
- Hello, hello!

400
01:07:46,072 --> 01:07:50,862
Dr Jones, whatever are you doing
in such a nasty place?

401
01:07:51,072 --> 01:07:52,869
Come down, I'll show you.

402
01:07:53,072 --> 01:07:58,385
Thanks, but we're very comfortable
up here. That's right, isn't it?

403
01:07:58,592 --> 01:08:02,107
Yes, we are very comfortable up here.

404
01:08:02,312 --> 01:08:07,147
So, once again,
what was briefly yours is now mine.

405
01:08:08,032 --> 01:08:10,705
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.

406
01:08:10,912 --> 01:08:14,587
You'll be a permanent addition
to this archaeological find.

407
01:08:14,792 --> 01:08:19,547
In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.

408
01:08:19,752 --> 01:08:22,903
- Son of a bitch.
- We must be going now.

409
01:08:23,112 --> 01:08:29,426
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
But I do not wish to leave you all alone.

410
01:08:29,632 --> 01:08:32,305
Slimy pig, let me go. Stop it!

411
01:08:37,312 --> 01:08:38,665
Hang on!

412
01:08:40,632 --> 01:08:43,624
Don't fall. I've got an idea.

413
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,790
You traitor, get your hands off of me!

414
01:08:57,472 --> 01:08:59,428
Snakes...

415
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:02,384
At your feet!

416
01:09:02,592 --> 01:09:07,382
- The girl was mine!
- She's no use to the Führer's mission.

417
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:13,746
I wonder sometimes
if you have that clearly in mind.

418
01:09:13,952 --> 01:09:18,423
- It was not to be, chérie.
- You bastards, I'll get you for this!

419
01:09:18,632 --> 01:09:21,669
Indiana Jones, adieu.

420
01:09:45,072 --> 01:09:48,621
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.

421
01:09:48,832 --> 01:09:51,266
This whole place is slithering!

422
01:09:54,312 --> 01:09:56,985
- Indy!
- Jesus!

423
01:10:00,672 --> 01:10:04,711
- Where did you get this? From him?
- I was trying to escape.

424
01:10:04,912 --> 01:10:07,984
- How hard did you try?
- Where the hell were you?

425
01:10:08,192 --> 01:10:11,025
- What are you doing?
- Help me, fire!

426
01:10:13,432 --> 01:10:15,866
- How do we get out?
- I'm working on it.

427
01:10:16,072 --> 01:10:17,824
Do it faster.

428
01:10:23,872 --> 01:10:26,466
- Where are you going?
- Through that wall.

429
01:10:27,312 --> 01:10:32,147
- Get ready to run, whatever happens.
- What do you mean by that?

430
01:10:42,752 --> 01:10:46,540
Indy! Don't leave me here by myself.

431
01:11:12,232 --> 01:11:17,989
- Here we go, get ready!
- Indy, the torch is going out!

432
01:12:20,312 --> 01:12:22,348
Look, look.

433
01:12:59,472 --> 01:13:04,102
They're flying it out. When it's loaded,
we'll already be on the plane.

434
01:13:08,992 --> 01:13:13,543
Monsieur, let us toast our success
in the desert. To the Ark.

435
01:13:13,752 --> 01:13:17,188
When we are far from here,
and not with you.

436
01:16:05,872 --> 01:16:08,147
Stay with the Ark!

437
01:16:13,192 --> 01:16:15,626
Look out!

438
01:16:24,832 --> 01:16:26,948
- Oh, my God!
- Marion... !

439
01:16:27,152 --> 01:16:29,985
I'm locked in here. I'm here!

440
01:16:32,032 --> 01:16:35,820
- Indy, I'm stuck.
- Pull on the latch.

441
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:40,230
I'm stuck.

442
01:16:40,432 --> 01:16:43,424
Indy, I can't force the lock.

443
01:17:12,152 --> 01:17:14,382
- It's stuck.
- Turn it.

444
01:17:14,592 --> 01:17:17,152
- It's stuck.
- Never mind. Get back!

445
01:17:37,832 --> 01:17:39,902
Get the Ark away from here.

446
01:17:40,112 --> 01:17:43,582
Put it on the truck.
We will fly it out of Cairo.

447
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:46,989
And, Gobler, I want plenty of protection.

448
01:17:52,512 --> 01:17:54,309
Jones... !

449
01:17:59,472 --> 01:18:04,341
Holy smoke! My friends,
I'm so pleased you're not dead.

450
01:18:04,552 --> 01:18:09,672
We have no time if you want the Ark.
It's been loaded onto a truck for Cairo.

451
01:18:09,872 --> 01:18:12,511
Truck? What truck?

452
01:18:39,392 --> 01:18:40,950
Let's go!

453
01:18:48,832 --> 01:18:52,302
Get back to Cairo.
Get us some transport to England.

454
01:18:52,512 --> 01:18:58,223
Boat, plane, anything. Meet me
at Omar's. I'm going after that truck.

455
01:18:58,432 --> 01:19:02,903
- How?
- I don't know. I'm making this up as I go.

456
01:26:24,552 --> 01:26:27,544
Everything is arranged.
The Ark is on board.

457
01:26:27,752 --> 01:26:30,585
Nothing's lacking now you're here.

458
01:26:30,792 --> 01:26:33,306
- You trust these guys?
- Yes.

459
01:26:34,832 --> 01:26:37,300
Mr Katanga.

460
01:26:39,632 --> 01:26:44,103
Mr Katanga, these are my friends.
They are my family.

461
01:26:44,312 --> 01:26:47,384
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.

462
01:26:47,592 --> 01:26:49,662
My cabin is theirs.

463
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:54,024
Mr Jones, I've heard a lot about you, sir.

464
01:26:54,232 --> 01:26:58,111
Your appearance
is exactly the way I imagined.

465
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,224
Goodbye.

466
01:27:05,552 --> 01:27:10,546
Look after each other.
I am already missing you.

467
01:27:11,672 --> 01:27:13,902
You're my good friend.

468
01:27:20,712 --> 01:27:22,703
That is for Fayah.

469
01:27:23,872 --> 01:27:27,467
That is for your children.
And this is for you.

470
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:34,024
Thank you.

471
01:27:42,312 --> 01:27:47,261
A British tar is a soaring soul

472
01:27:47,472 --> 01:27:51,351
As free as a mountain bird

473
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:56,831
His energetic fist
should be ready to resist

474
01:28:05,432 --> 01:28:07,343
Where did you go?

475
01:28:07,552 --> 01:28:12,148
- I've been cleaning up.
- Where did you get that?

476
01:28:12,352 --> 01:28:14,502
- From him.
- Who "him"?

477
01:28:14,712 --> 01:28:18,944
Katanga. I'm not the first woman
to travel with these pirates.

478
01:28:19,152 --> 01:28:22,542
- It's lovely.
- Yeah?

479
01:28:22,752 --> 01:28:25,710
- Yeah.
- Really?

480
01:28:36,952 --> 01:28:39,068
What did you say?

481
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:47,271
Wait, I don't need any help.

482
01:28:47,472 --> 01:28:53,229
You do... You're not the man
I knew ten years ago.

483
01:28:53,432 --> 01:28:58,028
It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.

484
01:29:04,632 --> 01:29:08,420
I don't need a nurse. I just want to sleep.

485
01:29:08,632 --> 01:29:12,545
- How's this here?
- Go away... ! Yes, it hurts.

486
01:29:13,592 --> 01:29:17,107
Goddamn it, lndy. Where doesn't it hurt?

487
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,428
Here.

488
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:26,348
Here.

489
01:29:34,192 --> 01:29:37,025
This isn't too bad.

490
01:29:45,152 --> 01:29:47,143
Here.

491
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:17,701
We never seem to get a break, do we?

492
01:30:43,432 --> 01:30:45,707
- What is it?
- Engines have stopped.

493
01:30:45,912 --> 01:30:48,062
I'm gonna do a check.

494
01:30:57,792 --> 01:31:01,102
- What's happening?
- We have most important friends.

495
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:07,104
You and the girl
must disappear in the hold. Go, go!

496
01:31:28,592 --> 01:31:31,026
Don't you touch me.

497
01:32:13,272 --> 01:32:16,503
- What about Jones?
- No trace yet.

498
01:32:16,712 --> 01:32:19,021
Jones is dead.

499
01:32:21,152 --> 01:32:24,383
I killed him. He was of no use to us.

500
01:32:25,192 --> 01:32:31,347
This girl has certain value where
we're headed. She'll bring a good price.

501
01:32:33,472 --> 01:32:37,101
Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken.

502
01:32:37,312 --> 01:32:40,907
Take it, but leave us the girl.
It will reduce our loss.

503
01:32:41,112 --> 01:32:46,186
Savage, you are not in the position
to ask for anything.

504
01:32:46,392 --> 01:32:51,671
We will take what we wish, then decide
whether to blow up your ship.

505
01:32:54,232 --> 01:32:58,225
The girl goes with me.
She'll be part of my compensation.

506
01:32:58,432 --> 01:33:01,185
I'm sure your führer would approve.

507
01:33:01,392 --> 01:33:07,342
If she fails to please me,
you may do with her as you wish.

508
01:33:07,592 --> 01:33:09,503
Excuse me.

509
01:33:24,512 --> 01:33:27,390
I can't find Mr Jones.
I've looked everywhere.

510
01:33:27,592 --> 01:33:29,901
He's got to be here somewhere.

511
01:33:30,112 --> 01:33:33,787
- Look again.
- I've found him.

512
01:33:33,992 --> 01:33:36,301
- Where?
- There.

513
01:35:56,152 --> 01:35:59,189
The altar has been prepared
as you instructed.

514
01:35:59,392 --> 01:36:03,305
Good. Take the Ark there immediately.

515
01:36:04,672 --> 01:36:06,788
Monsieur...

516
01:36:07,752 --> 01:36:12,268
I am uncomfortable
with the thought of this Jewish ritual.

517
01:36:14,032 --> 01:36:16,227
Are you sure it's necessary?

518
01:36:16,432 --> 01:36:19,742
Let me ask you this:
would you be more comfortable

519
01:36:19,952 --> 01:36:23,661
opening the Ark in Berlin for your führer

520
01:36:23,872 --> 01:36:27,865
and finding out only then
if the sacred Covenant is inside,

521
01:36:28,072 --> 01:36:30,984
and whether you've
accomplished your mission

522
01:36:31,192 --> 01:36:34,628
and obtained the one true Ark?

523
01:38:06,552 --> 01:38:09,908
I'm going to blow up the Ark, René.

524
01:38:14,792 --> 01:38:18,387
Your persistence surprises even me.

525
01:38:18,592 --> 01:38:22,870
- You'll give mercenaries a bad name.
- Dr Jones...

526
01:38:25,592 --> 01:38:27,947
Surely you don't think you can escape?

527
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:33,067
That depends how reasonable we're
all willing to be. All I want is the girl.

528
01:38:37,272 --> 01:38:42,824
- If we refuse?
- Then your führer has no prize.

529
01:38:43,032 --> 01:38:46,786
OK, stand back.
All of you, stand back, right back.

530
01:38:46,992 --> 01:38:49,745
OK, Jones, you win.

531
01:38:50,952 --> 01:38:53,227
Blow it up.

532
01:38:58,192 --> 01:39:03,027
Yes, blow it up. Blow it back to God.

533
01:39:03,952 --> 01:39:07,786
All your life has been spent
pursuing archaeological relics.

534
01:39:07,992 --> 01:39:11,905
Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.

535
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:15,582
You want to see it open as well as l.

536
01:39:16,512 --> 01:39:21,506
Indiana, we are simply
passing through history.

537
01:39:22,712 --> 01:39:28,025
This...this is history.

538
01:39:37,512 --> 01:39:38,865
Do as you will.

539
01:42:08,192 --> 01:42:12,743
Marion, don't look at it,
no matter what happens.

540
01:42:40,552 --> 01:42:42,349
It's beautiful!

541
01:42:52,312 --> 01:42:55,827
- Indy?
- Don't look. Keep your eyes shut!

542
01:44:43,552 --> 01:44:46,544
You've done your country a great service.

543
01:44:46,752 --> 01:44:50,267
We trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.

544
01:44:50,472 --> 01:44:53,623
The money's fine.
The situation is unacceptable.

545
01:44:53,832 --> 01:44:58,110
- I guess that wraps it up.
- Where is the Ark?

546
01:44:59,432 --> 01:45:03,710
I thought we'd settled that.
The Ark is somewhere safe.

547
01:45:03,912 --> 01:45:07,302
- From whom?
- It's a source of unspeakable power.

548
01:45:07,512 --> 01:45:10,709
- It has to be researched.
- And it will be.

549
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:14,382
I assure you, Dr Brody. Dr Jones.

550
01:45:14,592 --> 01:45:18,665
We have top men
working on it right now.

551
01:45:18,872 --> 01:45:24,026
- Who?
- Top men.

552
01:45:26,712 --> 01:45:29,829
Hey, what happened?
You don't look very happy.

553
01:45:30,032 --> 01:45:32,592
- Fools!
- What did they say?

554
01:45:33,712 --> 01:45:39,150
- They don't know what they've got.
- I know what I've got here.

555
01:45:39,352 --> 01:45:42,822
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

556
01:45:43,912 --> 01:45:47,188
You know, a drink?
