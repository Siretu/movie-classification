1
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,589
-You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!

2
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,400
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

3
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,679
Go back to the Shadow.

4
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,189
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

5
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,237
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,918
No! No!

7
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,991
Gandalf!

8
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,912
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,317
No!

10
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,191
Gandalf!

11
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,792
Gandalf!

12
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,910
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,432
Nothing.

14
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,431
Just a dream.

15
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,189
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,432
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

17
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,870
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,717
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,872
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,918
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,197
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,231
-What's in this?
-Nothing.

23
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,555
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,793
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,436
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,234
You never know.

27
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,513
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,908
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,031
It is special.

30
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,591
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,069
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

32
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,876
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,355
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,877
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,029
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,077
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,716
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,552
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,836
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,232
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,473
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,359
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

43
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,071
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam. . .

44
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,313
. . .but they did.

45
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,829
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,953
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,389
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,119
-What food have we got left?
-Let me see.

49
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,791
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,599
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,110
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,317
I don't usually hold with foreign food. . .

53
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,353
. . .but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,556
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

55
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,355
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,873
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,834
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,468
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,957
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,236
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,231
-Can you smell it?
-Yes.

62
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,350
I can smell it.

63
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,835
We're not alone.

64
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,833
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,788
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,510
Where is it?

67
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,274
Where is it?

68
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,037
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,239
My precious.

70
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,191
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,273
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,792
This is Sting.

73
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,439
You've seen it before. . .

74
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,989
. . . haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,236
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,358
It burns!

77
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,715
It burns us!

78
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,553
It freezes!

79
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,430
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,160
-Take it off us!
-Quiet, you!

81
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,513
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,194
-Let's just tie him up and leave him.
-No!

83
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,796
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,554
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,116
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,710
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,716
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

88
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,599
Take it off us.

89
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,354
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,397
We swears.

91
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,989
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

92
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,278
We swears. . .

93
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,031
. . .to serve the master
of the precious.

94
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,830
We will swear on. . .

95
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,877
. . .on the precious.

96
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,156
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,279
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,354
Yes. . .

99
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,309
. . .on the precious.

100
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,909
On the precious.

101
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,473
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,756
-Get down! I said, down!
-Sam!

103
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,598
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,672
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

105
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,997
-You know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.

106
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,472
You've been there before?

107
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,953
Yes.

108
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,914
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,835
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,630
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,918
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,390
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

113
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,271
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,193
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,275
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

116
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,795
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,230
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,516
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,114
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,838
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,031
Follow me!

122
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,633
Merry!

123
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,993
Merry!

124
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,949
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

125
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,872
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,071
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,038
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,237
We will deliver them.

129
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,519
Merry!

130
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,912
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,037
My friend is sick.

132
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,000
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,508
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,192
Stop it!

135
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,834
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,868
-Leave him alone!
-Why?

137
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,715
You want some?

138
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,631
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,876
Merry.

140
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,159
Hello, Pip.

141
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,235
-You're hurt.
-I'm fine.

142
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,834
-It was just an act.
-An act?

143
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,193
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,432
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,551
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,754
Man-flesh.

147
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,075
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,189
Aragorn.

149
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,592
Let's move!

150
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,629
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,511
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,352
Hurry!

153
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,558
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,395
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,393
No food. No rest.

156
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,394
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,632
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

158
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,150
They may yet be alive.

159
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,520
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,389
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,678
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,311
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,232
Rohan.

164
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,073
Home of the Horse-Iords.

165
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,674
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,718
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

167
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,713
Sets its will against us.

168
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,473
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,108
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,990
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,034
Saruman.

172
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,157
The world is changing.

173
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,713
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard. . .

174
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,999
. . . And Mordor?

175
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,993
To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman. . .

176
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,675
. . . And the union of the two towers?

177
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,753
Together, my Lord Sauron. . .

178
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,310
. . . We shall rule this Middle-earth.

179
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,798
The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.

180
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,471
The forests will fall.

181
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,033
A new order will rise.

182
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,756
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear. . .

183
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,754
. . . And the iron fists of the Orc.

184
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,792
I want them armed and ready to march
within two weeks!

185
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,552
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,598
We cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

187
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,797
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,675
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

189
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,078
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

190
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,675
-Burn it.
-Yes.

191
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,555
We will fight for you.

192
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,631
Swear it.

193
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,276
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,231
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,757
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,273
Murderers!

197
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,196
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,078
Burn every village!

199
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,075
We have only to remove those
who oppose us.

200
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,028
It will begin in Rohan.

201
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,116
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

202
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,032
But no more.

203
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,350
Éothain! Éothain!

204
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,000
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,920
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,672
He is too big for him.

207
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,718
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

208
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,314
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, Mama.

209
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,358
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,069
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,438
Quickly!

212
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,073
Go, child.

213
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,311
Rohan, my lord. . .

214
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,359
. . .is ready to fall.

215
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,599
Théodred.

216
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,358
Find the king's son!

217
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,911
-Mordor will pay for this.
-These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,479
My Lord Éomer, over here!

219
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,672
He's alive.

220
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,231
Théodred.

221
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,952
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,749
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,715
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,429
That is a lie.

225
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,236
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

226
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,756
Grýma.

227
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,951
Grýma.

228
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,879
Grýma.

229
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,558
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

230
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,390
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

231
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,793
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,872
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,395
Can you not see?

234
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,395
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent. . .

235
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,994
. . .your warmongering.

236
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,997
Warmongering?

237
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,230
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

238
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,315
What was the promised price, Grýma?

239
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,075
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

240
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,560
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,631
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,512
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

243
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,795
Too much.

244
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,636
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan. . .

245
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,396
. . .and all its domains
under pain of death.

246
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,070
You have no authority here.

247
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,595
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,795
This order does not come from me.

249
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,030
It comes from the king.

250
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,160
He signed it this morning.

251
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,994
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,838
Breathe.

253
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,475
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,911
We're not going no further. . .

255
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,991
. . . until we've had a breather.

256
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,397
Get a fire going!

257
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,833
Merry!

258
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,434
Merry!

259
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,074
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,236
What's making that noise?

261
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,159
It's the trees.

262
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,869
What?

263
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,875
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,352
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall. . .

265
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,999
. . .and come alive.

266
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,832
Alive?

267
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,318
Trees that could whisper. . .

268
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,635
. . .talk to each other. . .

269
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,597
. . .even move.

270
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,270
I'm starving.

271
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,353
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

272
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,908
Yeah!

273
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,237
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,636
What about them?

275
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,597
They're fresh.

276
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,869
They are not for eating.

277
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,477
What about their legs?

278
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,870
They don't need those.

279
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,312
-They look tasty.
-Get back, scum!

280
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,750
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,951
Alive?

282
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,918
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

283
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,431
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

284
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,512
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,077
They think we have the Ring.

286
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,549
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

287
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,237
Just a mouthful. . .

288
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,549
. . .a bit of the flank.

289
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,516
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

290
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,034
Pippin.

291
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,838
Let's go.

292
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,399
Go on.

293
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,993
Call for help.

294
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,349
Squeal.

295
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,597
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,793
Pippin!

297
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,429
A red sun rises.

298
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,753
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,477
Riders of Rohan. . .

300
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,189
. . .what news from the Mark?

301
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,032
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,994
Speak quickly!

303
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,791
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,028
I would cut off your head, Dwarf. . .

305
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,710
. . .if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

306
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,711
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,877
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,239
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,517
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

310
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,749
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

311
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,076
Not even his own kin.

312
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,277
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king. . .

313
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,317
. . .and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,078
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,912
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,071
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,029
He walks here and there, they say. . .

318
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,156
. . .as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,589
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

320
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,876
We are no spies.

321
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,873
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,390
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

323
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,515
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,717
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,713
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

326
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,831
We left none alive.

327
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,278
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,714
Dead?

329
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,238
I am sorry.

330
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,755
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,991
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,713
Farewell.

333
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,875
Look for your friends.

334
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,430
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,514
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,631
We ride north!

337
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,952
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,116
We failed them.

339
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,670
A Hobbit lay here.

340
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,038
And the other.

341
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,913
They crawled.

342
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,956
Their hands were bound.

343
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,352
Their bonds were cut.

344
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,196
They ran over here.

345
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,835
They were followed.

346
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,592
The belt!

347
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,435
Run!

348
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,234
Tracks lead away from the battle. . .

349
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,956
. . .into Fangorn Forest.

350
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,199
Fangorn?

351
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,874
What madness drove them in there?

352
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,758
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

353
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,470
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

354
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,389
Come here!

355
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,148
Trees. Climb a tree.

356
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,792
He's gone.

357
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,590
Merry!

358
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,798
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

359
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,119
Run, Merry!

360
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,672
Little Orcs.

361
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,070
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

362
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,037
Tree?

363
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,078
I am no tree!

364
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,396
I am an Ent.

365
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,990
A tree-herder.

366
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,391
A shepherd of the forest.

367
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,834
Don't talk to it, Merry.

368
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,753
Don't encourage it!

369
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,993
Treebeard, some call me.

370
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,037
And whose side are you on?

371
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,198
Side?

372
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,119
I am on nobody's side. . .

373
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,600
. . .because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

374
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,831
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

375
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,469
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

376
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,835
Hobbits?

377
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,716
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

378
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,152
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

379
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,436
They come with fire.

380
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,108
They come with axes.

381
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,910
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

382
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,755
-Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
-No!

383
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,639
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

384
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,558
Halflings!

385
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,835
Shire-folk!

386
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,230
Maybe you are. . .

387
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,990
. . .and maybe you aren't.

388
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,794
The White Wizard will know.

389
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,437
The White Wizard?

390
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,313
Saruman.

391
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,998
See? See?

392
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,475
We've led you out.

393
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,074
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

394
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,474
Very lucky we find you.

395
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,518
Nice Hobbit.

396
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,437
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

397
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,114
A swamp, yes, yes.

398
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,391
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

399
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,910
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

400
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,554
I found it. I did.

401
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,320
The way through the marshes.

402
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,836
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

403
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,953
They go around for miles and miles.

404
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,513
Come quickly.

405
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,599
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

406
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,917
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

407
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,230
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

408
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,676
No, no birdses to eat.

409
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,993
No crunchable birdses.

410
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,313
And we are famished! Yes!

411
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,598
Famished we are, precious!

412
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,399
Here.

413
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,476
What does it eats?

414
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,517
Is it tasty?

415
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,114
It tries to chokes us!

416
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,875
We can't eats Hobbit food!

417
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,399
We must starve!

418
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,835
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

419
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,710
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

420
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,599
It does not care if we be hungry.

421
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:20,391
Does not care if we should die.

422
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,719
Not like master.

423
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,031
Master cares.

424
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,957
Master knows.

425
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,197
Yes.

426
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,874
Precious.

427
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,790
Once it takes hold of us. . .

428
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,599
. . .it never lets go.

429
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,355
Don't touch me!

430
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,317
There are dead things!

431
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,152
Dead faces in the water.

432
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,634
All dead. All rotten.

433
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,749
Elves and Men and Orcses.

434
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,390
A great battle long ago.

435
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,832
Dead Marshes.

436
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,634
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

437
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,958
This way.

438
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,759
Don't follow the lights.

439
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,115
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones. . .

440
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:03,279
. . .and light little candles
of their own.

441
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,833
Frodo!

442
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,991
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights.

443
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,878
-Gollum!
-Mr. Frodo!

444
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,872
Are you all right?

445
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,438
So bright.

446
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,275
So beautiful.

447
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,115
Our precious.

448
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,919
What did you say?

449
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,276
Master should be resting.

450
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,353
Master needs to keep up his strength.

451
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,357
-Who are you?
-Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

452
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,953
Gollum. Gollum.

453
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,872
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

454
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,953
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

455
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,633
He said your life was a sad story.

456
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,157
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

457
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,198
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

458
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,078
Were you?

459
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,310
Sméagol.

460
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,274
What did you call me?

461
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,199
That was your name once, wasn't it?

462
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,990
A long time ago.

463
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,870
My name.

464
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,353
My name.

465
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,389
Sméagol.

466
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,878
Black Riders!

467
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,314
Hide! Hide!

468
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,675
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

469
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,310
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

470
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,640
-I thought they were dead.
-Dead?

471
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,598
No, you cannot kill them. No.

472
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,709
Wraiths!

473
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,996
Wraiths on wings!

474
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,631
They are calling for it.

475
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,150
They are calling for the precious.

476
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,316
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

477
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,674
I'm here.

478
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,519
Hurry, Hobbits.

479
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,316
The Black Gate is very close.

480
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,197
Orc blood.

481
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,472
These are strange tracks.

482
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,597
The air is so close in here.

483
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,069
This forest is old.

484
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,751
Very old.

485
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,635
Full of memory. . .

486
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,390
. . .and anger.

487
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,073
The trees are speaking to each other.

488
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,673
Gimli!

489
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,717
Lower your ax.

490
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,039
They have feelings, my friend.

491
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,471
The Elves began it.

492
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,191
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

493
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,910
Talking trees.

494
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,438
What do trees have to talk about?

495
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,717
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

496
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,559
Something's out there.

497
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,558
What do you see?

498
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,435
The White Wizard approaches.

499
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,478
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

500
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,830
We must be quick.

501
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,275
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

502
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,193
Where are they?

503
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,750
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

504
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,038
They met someone they did not expect.

505
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,236
Does that comfort you?

506
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,277
Who are you?

507
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,591
Show yourself!

508
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,036
It cannot be.

509
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,829
Forgive me.

510
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,231
I mistook you for Saruman.

511
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,639
I am Saruman.

512
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,829
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

513
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,193
You fell.

514
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,034
Through fire. . .

515
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,428
. . .and water.

516
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,274
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak. . .

517
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,035
. . . I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.

518
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,834
Until at last I threw down
my enemy. . .

519
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,278
. . . And smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.

520
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,508
Darkness took me. . .

521
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,153
. . . And I strayed out of thought
and time.

522
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,838
Stars wheeled overhead. . .

523
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:32,392
. . . And every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

524
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,476
But it was not the end.

525
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,439
I felt life in me again.

526
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,714
I've been sent back. . .

527
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,359
. . . until my task is done.

528
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,597
Gandalf.

529
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,151
Gandalf?

530
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,278
Yes.

531
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,678
That was what they used to call me.

532
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,590
Gandalf the Grey.

533
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,552
That was my name.

534
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,119
Gandalf.

535
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,991
I am Gandalf the White.

536
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,838
And I come back to you now. . .

537
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,389
. . .at the turn of the tide.

538
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,318
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

539
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,077
-We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
-Edoras?

540
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,916
That is no short distance!

541
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,232
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

542
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,436
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

543
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,876
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

544
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,951
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here. . .

545
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:44,193
. . .in this horrid, dark, dank,
tree-infested--?

546
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,717
I mean, charming. . .

547
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,519
. . .quite charming forest.

548
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,555
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

549
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,872
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

550
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,350
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones. . .

551
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,717
. . .that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

552
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,758
In one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

553
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,356
You still speak in riddles.

554
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:23,235
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

555
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,870
The Ents are going to wake up. . .

556
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,712
-. . .and find that they are strong.
-Strong?!

557
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,555
Oh, that's good.

558
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,314
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

559
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,510
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

560
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,195
I n fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

561
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,955
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

562
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,679
That is one of the Mearas. . .

563
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,513
. . . unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

564
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,595
Shadowfax.

565
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,548
He is the lord of all horses. . .

566
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,874
. . .and has been my friend
through many dangers.

567
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,996
O rowan mine

568
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,789
I saw you shine

569
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,350
Upon a summer's day

570
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,712
Upon your head
How golden-red

571
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,396
The crown you bore aloft

572
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,869
Such a beautiful verse.

573
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,750
-Is it much further?
-Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

574
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,037
You might call it far, perhaps.

575
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,549
My home lies deep in the forest. . .

576
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,469
. . . near the roots of the mountain.

577
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,269
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

578
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,314
And safe is where I'll keep you.

579
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,712
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

580
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,998
It's one of my own compositions.

581
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,309
Right.

582
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:59,350
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

583
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,196
And the dreams of trees unfold

584
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:10,549
When woodland halls are green and cool

585
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,633
And the wind is in the West

586
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,640
Come back to me

587
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,438
Come back to me

588
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:28,755
And say my land is best

589
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,435
Sleep, little Shirelings.

590
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,036
Heed no nightly noise.

591
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,954
Sleep till morning light.

592
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,513
I have business in the forest.

593
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:57,993
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

594
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,631
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

595
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:09,397
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

596
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,513
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

597
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,794
Sauron will suffer no rival.

598
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,318
From the summit of Barad-dûr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

599
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,756
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

600
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,637
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

601
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,268
The rumor has reached him.

602
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,273
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.

603
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,919
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

604
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,276
He fears what you may become.

605
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,756
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

606
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,390
He will use his puppet, Saruman,
to destroy Rohan.

607
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,993
War is coming.

608
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,596
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge. . .

609
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,069
. . .for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

610
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,789
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

611
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,918
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

612
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:16,596
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

613
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,430
But for all their cunning. . .

614
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,068
. . .we have one advantage.

615
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,588
The Ring remains hidden.

616
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,477
And that we should seek to destroy it. . .

617
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,473
. . . has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

618
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,237
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor. . .

619
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,833
. . .in the hands of a Hobbit.

620
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,913
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

621
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,594
We must trust now in Frodo.

622
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,512
Everything depends upon speed. . .

623
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,558
. . .and the secrecy of his quest.

624
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,637
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

625
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,113
Frodo must finish this task alone.

626
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,030
He's not alone.

627
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,838
Sam went with him.

628
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,629
Did he?

629
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:09,237
Did he, indeed? Good.

630
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,149
Yes, very good.

631
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:24,516
The Black Gate of Mordor.

632
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,589
Oh, save us.

633
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,237
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

634
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,678
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

635
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,116
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

636
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,474
I did.

637
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,796
That's it, then.

638
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,508
We can't get past that.

639
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,154
Look!

640
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,719
The gate.

641
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,029
It's opening!

642
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,071
I can see a way down.

643
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,796
Sam, no!

644
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,199
Master!

645
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,990
-I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
-I know, Mr. Frodo.

646
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,757
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

647
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,957
-Now!
-No!

648
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,391
No! No, master!

649
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,438
They catch you! They catch you!

650
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,114
Don't take it to him.

651
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,554
He wants the precious.

652
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,632
Always he is looking for it.

653
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,554
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

654
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,514
But we mustn't let him have it.

655
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,676
No! There's another way.

656
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,400
More secret. A dark way.

657
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,195
-Why haven't you spoken of this before?
-Because master did not ask.

658
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,709
He's up to something.

659
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,748
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

660
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,559
Yes. There's a path. . .

661
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,109
. . .and some stairs.

662
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,912
And then. . .

663
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,277
. . .a tunnel.

664
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,398
He's led us this far, Sam.

665
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,913
Mr. Frodo, no.

666
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,399
He's been true to his word.

667
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,229
No.

668
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,838
Lead the way, Sméagol.

669
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,194
Good Sméagol always helps.

670
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,749
Hello?

671
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,036
Treebeard?

672
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,999
Where has he gone?

673
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,515
I had the loveliest dream last night.

674
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,714
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

675
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,269
And we smoked all of it.
And then. . .

676
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,591
. . .you were sick.

677
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,839
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

678
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,077
Did you hear that?

679
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,273
There it is again.

680
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:16,557
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

681
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,998
You just said something. . .Treeish.

682
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,994
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

683
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,037
You're taller.

684
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,993
-Who?
-You!

685
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,718
-Than what?
-Than me!

686
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,236
I've always been taller than you.

687
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,837
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

688
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,119
Please, Merry.

689
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,955
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

690
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,239
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

691
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,430
3'8"!

692
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,072
Three-foot-eight.

693
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,831
You did something.

694
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,913
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

695
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,233
Merry!

696
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,630
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

697
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,554
-I want some!
-It could well be dangerous!

698
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,790
Give me it back. Merry!

699
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,834
What's happening?!

700
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,079
It's got my leg!

701
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,833
Merry!

702
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,992
Help!

703
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,237
Away with you.

704
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,118
You should not be waking.

705
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,355
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

706
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,388
Go to sleep.

707
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,472
Away with you.

708
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,837
Come, the forest is waking up.

709
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,237
It isn't safe.

710
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:26,514
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

711
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,592
Anger festers in their hearts.

712
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,958
Black are their thoughts.

713
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,554
Strong is their hate.

714
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,359
They will harm you if they can.

715
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,956
There are too few of us now.

716
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,954
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

717
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,074
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

718
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,312
-Are there Ent children?
-Bru-ra-hroom.

719
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:56,873
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

720
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:02,068
-Why is that?
-We lost the Entwives.

721
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,673
Oh, I'm sorry.

722
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,594
-How did they die?
-Die? No.

723
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,877
We lost them.

724
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,909
And now we cannot find them.

725
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:22,030
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

726
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,668
Can't say that I have.

727
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,116
You, Pip?

728
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,795
What do they look like?

729
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,631
I don't remember now.

730
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:57,114
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

731
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,400
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan. . .

732
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,838
. . . Whose mind is overthrown.

733
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,073
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

734
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:11,757
My lord, your son. . .

735
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,990
. . . he is dead.

736
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,192
My lord?

737
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,515
Uncle?

738
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,235
Will you not go to him?

739
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,509
Will you do nothing?

740
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,591
Be careful what you say.

741
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,830
Do not look for welcome here.

742
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,913
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

743
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,150
What a tragedy for the king. . .

744
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,193
. . .to lose his only son and heir.

745
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,592
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

746
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:20,470
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

747
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,039
Leave me alone, snake!

748
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,032
Oh, but you are alone.

749
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,151
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness. . .

750
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,630
. . .in the bitter watches of the night. . .

751
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,315
. . .when all your life seems to shrink.

752
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,519
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

753
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:47,071
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

754
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,031
So fair.

755
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,559
So cold.

756
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,396
Like a morning of pale spring. . .

757
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,876
. . .still clinging to winter's chill.

758
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,469
Your words are poison.

759
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,589
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

760
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:05,029
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

761
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,948
By order of Grýma Wormtongue.

762
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,278
Your staff.

763
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,876
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

764
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,673
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

765
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,153
He's a herald of woe.

766
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:08,552
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late. . .

767
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,993
. . .Théoden King.

768
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:14,114
He's not welcome.

769
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,074
Why should I welcome you. . .

770
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,075
. . .Gandalf Stormcrow?

771
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,437
A just question, my liege.

772
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,319
Late is the hour. . .

773
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,314
. . .in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

774
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,036
Láthspell I name him.

775
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,998
Ill news is an ill guest.

776
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:44,551
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

777
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,551
I have not passed
through fire and death. . .

778
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,837
. . .to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

779
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,796
His staff.

780
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,919
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

781
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,997
Théoden. . .

782
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,988
. . .son of Thengel. . .

783
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,955
. . .too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

784
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,951
I would stay still if I were you.

785
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,111
Hearken to me!

786
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,430
I release you. . .

787
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,477
. . .from the spell.

788
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,472
You have no power here. . .

789
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:44,110
. . .Gandalf the Grey.

790
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:54,155
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

791
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,679
Wait.

792
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,715
If I go, Théoden dies.

793
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,516
You did not kill me. . .

794
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,796
. . .you will not kill him.

795
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,158
Rohan is mine.

796
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,874
Be gone.

797
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,630
I know your face.

798
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,228
Éowyn.

799
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,634
Éowyn.

800
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,715
Gandalf?

801
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,993
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

802
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,308
Dark have been my dreams of late.

803
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,909
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better. . .

804
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,913
. . .if they grasped your sword.

805
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,111
I've only. . .

806
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:43,192
. . .ever served you, my lord.

807
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:48,150
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

808
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,997
Send me not from your sight.

809
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,794
No, my lord! No, my lord.

810
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,149
Let him go.

811
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,912
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

812
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,910
Get out of my way!

813
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,077
Hail, Théoden King!

814
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:43,154
Where is Théodred?

815
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,474
Where is my son?

816
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,758
Simbelmynë.

817
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:22,150
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

818
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,673
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

819
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:34,429
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

820
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,392
The young perish and the old linger.

821
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,996
That I should live. . .

822
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:45,391
. . .to see the last days of my house.

823
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,269
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

824
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,431
No parent should have to bury
their child.

825
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,277
He was strong in life.

826
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,756
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

827
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,317
They had no warning.

828
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,789
They were unarmed.

829
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:10,119
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

830
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,877
Rick, cot and tree.

831
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,316
Where is Mama?

832
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:20,119
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

833
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:24,512
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

834
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,918
Ride out and meet him head on.

835
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,996
Draw him away from your women
and children.

836
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,878
You must fight.

837
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:38,715
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

838
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,438
Éomer is loyal to you.

839
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,194
His men will return
and fight for their king.

840
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:47,114
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

841
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,756
Éomer cannot help us.

842
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,078
I know what it is you want of me. . .

843
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,357
. . .but I will not bring further death
to my people.

844
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,598
I will not risk open war.

845
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,951
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

846
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,598
When last I looked. . .

847
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:16,510
. . .Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

848
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,270
Then what is the king's decision?

849
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,914
By order of the king. . .

850
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,479
. . .the city must empty.

851
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,353
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

852
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,349
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

853
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:42,993
Helm's Deep.

854
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:46,550
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

855
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,597
Who will defend them if not their king?

856
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,115
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

857
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,032
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

858
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:56,909
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

859
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,196
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

860
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,430
What they will get is a massacre.

861
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,309
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

862
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:09,357
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

863
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,553
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

864
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,673
The people of Rohan will need you.

865
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,395
The defenses have to hold.

866
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,432
They will hold.

867
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,475
The Grey Pilgrim.

868
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,154
That's what they used to call me.

869
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:35,235
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

870
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,876
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

871
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:42,551
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

872
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,994
At dawn, look to the east.

873
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,639
Go.

874
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,037
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

875
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,471
His name is Brego.

876
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,751
He was my cousin's horse.

877
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,678
Brego.

878
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,793
Your name is kingly.

879
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,149
I have heard of the magic of Elves. . .

880
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,471
. . .but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

881
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,789
You speak as one of their own.

882
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,875
I was raised in Rivendell. . .

883
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,599
. . .for a time.

884
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,716
Turn this fellow free.

885
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,709
He's seen enough of war.

886
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,719
Gandalf the White.

887
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,155
Gandalf the Fool!

888
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:00,279
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

889
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:05,234
There were three
who followed the wizard.

890
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:10,760
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

891
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,793
You stink of horse.

892
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,637
The Man. . .

893
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:26,639
-. . .was he from Gondor?
-No, from the North.

894
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,429
One of the Dûnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

895
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,318
His cloth was poor.

896
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:38,115
And yet he bore a strange ring.

897
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:42,550
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

898
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:48,317
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

899
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,311
The Ring of Barahir.

900
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:54,676
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

901
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:58,037
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

902
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,839
The line was broken years ago.

903
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:03,593
It matters not.

904
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,194
The world of Men shall fall.

905
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,157
It will begin at Edoras.

906
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,831
I am ready, Gamling.

907
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,355
Bring my horse.

908
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,719
This is not a defeat.

909
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,189
We will return.

910
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,715
We will return.

911
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,037
You have some skill with a blade.

912
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,191
Women of this country learned long ago:

913
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,874
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

914
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,792
I fear neither death nor pain.

915
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,036
What do you fear, my lady?

916
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,032
A cage.

917
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,955
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

918
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,874
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

919
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,116
You're a daughter of kings. . .

920
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:42,471
. . .a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

921
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,994
I do not think that would be your fate.

922
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:24,592
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.

923
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,796
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

924
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,713
He will expect an attack on the city.

925
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,111
They will flee to Helm's Deep. . .

926
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,510
. . .the great fortress of Rohan.

927
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:41,878
It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

928
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,918
They will be slow.

929
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:49,512
They will have women and children
with them.

930
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,435
Send out your Warg-riders.

931
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:12,478
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

932
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,200
-Why do you do that?
-What?

933
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,794
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

934
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,156
Because.

935
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,676
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

936
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,956
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

937
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:29,033
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

938
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,350
You have no idea what it did to him. . .

939
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,909
. . .what it's still doing to him.

940
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,031
I want to help him, Sam.

941
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,428
Why?

942
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,512
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

943
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,431
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

944
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,239
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

945
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,919
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

946
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:08,789
I do.

947
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:12,557
It's the Ring.

948
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,593
You can't take your eyes off it.

949
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,191
I've seen you.

950
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:21,315
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

951
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,150
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

952
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,914
-You have to fight it.
-I know what I have to do, Sam.

953
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,878
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

954
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,712
Mine! My own!

955
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,556
Can't you hear yourself?

956
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,312
Don't you know who you sound like?

957
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,196
We wants it.

958
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,954
We needs it.

959
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:56,716
Must have the precious.

960
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,190
They stole it from us.

961
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:03,591
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

962
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,469
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

963
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:10,791
No. Not master.

964
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:14,635
Yes, precious. False.

965
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:19,112
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

966
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:22,555
Master's my friend.

967
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:27,589
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

968
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,189
Not listening. I'm not listening.

969
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:35,194
You're a liar and a thief.

970
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,313
No.

971
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,958
Murderer.

972
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:44,309
Go away.

973
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,755
Go away?

974
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:51,353
I hate you.

975
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,829
I hate you.

976
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:57,271
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

977
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,192
I saved us.

978
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:03,717
It was me. We survived because of me.

979
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,316
Not anymore.

980
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,113
What did you say?

981
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:16,755
Master looks after us now.

982
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:20,276
We don't need you.

983
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,473
What?

984
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:24,312
Leave now. . .

985
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:28,109
. . .and never come back.

986
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,269
No.

987
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,799
Leave now and never come back.

988
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:41,957
Leave now and never come back!

989
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,034
We told him to go away.

990
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:59,033
And away he goes, precious.

991
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,111
Gone! Gone! Gone!

992
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,032
Sméagol is free!

993
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:09,153
Look.

994
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:13,632
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

995
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,113
They are young.

996
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,714
They are tender. They are nice.

997
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:30,270
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

998
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,393
You'll make him sick, you will. . .

999
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:37,676
. . .behaving like that.

1000
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:42,633
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

1001
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:48,153
What's it doing?

1002
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,400
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1003
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,676
It ruins it.

1004
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:57,310
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

1005
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:03,748
What we need is a few good taters.

1006
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,518
What's taters, precious?

1007
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:09,352
What's taters? Eh?

1008
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,158
Po-ta-toes.

1009
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:14,597
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1010
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:21,319
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1011
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,391
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1012
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,790
Oh, yes, we could.

1013
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:30,316
Spoil a nice fish.

1014
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:34,074
Give it to us raw. . .

1015
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:37,152
. . .and wriggling.

1016
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:40,312
You keep nasty chips.

1017
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:43,191
You're hopeless.

1018
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:56,633
Mr. Frodo?

1019
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,360
-Who are they?
-Wicked Men.

1020
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,875
Servants of Sauron.

1021
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,756
They are called to Mordor.

1022
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,832
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

1023
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,037
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1024
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,035
-Ready to do what?
-To make his war.

1025
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:38,149
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1026
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:41,352
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1027
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,714
Mr. Frodo.

1028
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,758
Look.

1029
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:50,470
It's an oliphaunt.

1030
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,198
No one at home will believe this.

1031
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,672
Sméagol?

1032
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,789
We've lingered here too long.

1033
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:58,954
Come on, Sam.

1034
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:14,474
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1035
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:20,995
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1036
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,913
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1037
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:28,471
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1038
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:30,631
The enemy?

1039
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:35,956
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1040
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,356
You wonder what his name is. . .

1041
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,950
. . .where he came from.

1042
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,195
And if he was really evil at heart.

1043
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:53,110
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1044
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,029
If he would not rather have stayed there. . .

1045
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:00,599
. . .in peace.

1046
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,912
War will make corpses of us all.

1047
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:09,036
Bind their hands.

1048
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,559
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

1049
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:22,235
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance. . .

1050
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:25,437
. . .that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

1051
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:27,631
It's the beards.

1052
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,876
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief. . .

1053
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:32,793
. . .that there are no Dwarf women. . .

1054
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:37,033
. . .and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground. . .

1055
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,437
. . .which is, of course, ridiculous.

1056
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:48,475
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1057
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,871
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1058
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:56,315
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1059
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:59,239
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1060
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,595
Cut down by Orcs.

1061
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,638
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1062
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:09,756
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1063
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:14,277
Doomed to wait upon an old man,
who should have loved her as a father.

1064
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:26,115
Gimli.

1065
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,271
No, I couldn't.

1066
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:30,192
I really couldn't.

1067
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,078
I made some stew.

1068
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:39,357
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1069
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,836
Thank you.

1070
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,954
-It's good.
-Really?

1071
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:17,991
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1072
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:23,153
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1073
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,909
But he must be mistaken.

1074
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:30,392
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1075
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:34,552
Then you must be at least 60.

1076
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,073
Seventy?

1077
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,072
But you cannot be 80!

1078
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,599
Eighty-seven.

1079
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:49,596
You are one of the Dûnedain.

1080
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:53,592
A descendant of Nûmenor,
blessed with long life.

1081
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:57,280
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1082
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,592
There are few of us left.

1083
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:02,479
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1084
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:06,476
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1085
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:24,479
The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.

1086
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:28,550
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1087
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:32,589
Like my heart.

1088
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,554
Go to sleep.

1089
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,109
I am asleep.

1090
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:47,197
This is a dream.

1091
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:52,392
Then it is a good dream.

1092
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,911
Sleep.

1093
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,399
You told me once. . .

1094
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:35,836
This day would come.

1095
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,314
This is not the end. . .it is the beginning.

1096
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,550
You must go with Frodo.

1097
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:44,276
That is your path.

1098
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,794
My path is hidden from me.

1099
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:00,916
It is already laid before your feet.

1100
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:04,277
You cannot falter now.

1101
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:08,111
Arwen. . . .

1102
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:12,715
If you trust nothing else. . .

1103
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,036
Trust this. . .

1104
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,191
Trust us.

1105
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:57,312
Where is she?

1106
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:00,749
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1107
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:06,599
Our time here is ending.

1108
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:09,708
Arwen's time is ending.

1109
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,628
Let her go.

1110
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:13,711
Let her take the ship into the west.

1111
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:16,838
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

1112
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,718
There it will be ever green.

1113
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:22,435
But never more than memory.

1114
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:26,552
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

1115
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:30,230
-She stays because she still has hope.
-She stays for you.

1116
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,630
She belongs with her people.

1117
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:47,358
Is this how you would take your leave?

1118
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:50,557
Did you think you could slip away at
first light - unnoticed?

1119
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,475
I will not be coming back.

1120
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,118
You underestimate your skill in battle.

1121
01:48:58,280 --> 01:48:59,679
You will come back.

1122
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,796
It is not of death in battle that I speak.

1123
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:04,269
What do you speak of?

1124
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:12,238
You have a chance for another life. . .

1125
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:18,477
Away from war. . .grief. . .despair.

1126
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,712
Why are you saying this?

1127
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:25,277
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1128
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:29,240
It was a dream, Arwen.

1129
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:30,959
Nothing more.

1130
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:35,352
I don't believe you.

1131
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,752
This belongs to you.

1132
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:49,913
It was a gift.

1133
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:53,913
Keep it.

1134
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:57,469
My lord?

1135
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:04,551
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1136
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:28,473
What is it?

1137
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:31,876
-Háma?
-I'm not sure.

1138
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,751
Wargs!

1139
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,352
A scout!

1140
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,829
-What is it? What do you see?
-Warg! We're under attack!

1141
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:15,236
Get them out of here!

1142
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:21,756
All riders to the head of the column.

1143
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,311
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1144
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,152
Come on!

1145
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:39,835
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1146
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,433
-I can fight.
-No!

1147
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,991
You must do this, for me.

1148
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:49,433
Follow me!

1149
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:56,952
-Forward. I mean, charge forward.
-Make for the lower ground!

1150
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:59,680
-That's it! Go on!
-Stay together!

1151
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:11,155
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1152
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,353
That one counts as mine!

1153
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,918
Stinking creature.

1154
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:58,397
Aragorn!

1155
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:04,319
Aragorn?

1156
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:20,558
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1157
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,073
He's. . .

1158
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:24,153
. . .dead.

1159
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:27,553
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1160
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:32,268
You lie.

1161
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,358
Get the wounded on horses.

1162
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:10,637
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1163
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:13,076
Leave the dead.

1164
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:21,593
Come.

1165
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,918
-At last!
-Helm's Deep.

1166
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:35,833
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1167
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:40,032
We're safe!

1168
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:44,233
We're safe, my lady.

1169
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,549
Thank you.

1170
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:29,433
-Mama!
-Éothain!

1171
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,079
Freda!

1172
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:39,319
-Where is the rest?
-This is all we could save, my lady.

1173
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,274
Take it to the caves.

1174
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:47,159
Make way for the king.

1175
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:51,793
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

1176
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:02,955
So few. So few of you have returned.

1177
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:07,795
Our people are safe.

1178
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:11,514
We have paid for it with many lives.

1179
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:13,799
My lady.

1180
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:19,510
Lord Aragorn. . .

1181
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:20,874
. . .where is he?

1182
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,279
He fell.

1183
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:48,873
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1184
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,838
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1185
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:55,038
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

1186
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:57,714
Get them into the caves.

1187
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:03,190
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1188
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:08,436
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.

1189
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,830
Its outer wall is solid rock. . .

1190
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,958
. . . But for a small culvert
at its base. . .

1191
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:16,793
. . . Which is little more than a drain.

1192
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:23,513
How? How can fire undo stone?

1193
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:28,037
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1194
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:35,354
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1195
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:38,876
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning. . .

1196
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,508
. . .thousands, to storm the Keep.

1197
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:43,033
Tens of thousands.

1198
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:47,113
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1199
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:01,518
A new power is rising.

1200
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:04,558
Its victory is at hand.

1201
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,991
This night. . .

1202
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:16,552
. . .the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1203
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:19,917
March to Helm's Deep!

1204
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:23,436
Leave none alive!

1205
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:28,229
To war!

1206
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,278
There will be no dawn for Men.

1207
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:54,716
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1208
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:57,917
There is always smoke rising. . .

1209
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:01,795
. . .from Isengard these days.

1210
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:03,553
Isengard?

1211
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,557
There was a time. . .

1212
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:09,270
. . .when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1213
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:12,637
But now he has a mind of metal. . .

1214
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:15,635
. . .and wheels.

1215
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:20,672
He no longer cares for growing things.

1216
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:22,558
What is it?

1217
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,476
It's Saruman's army.

1218
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:31,153
The war has started.

1219
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:12,078
May the grace of the Valar
protect you.

1220
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,837
Brego.

1221
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:11,029
Arwen.

1222
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:14,117
It is time.

1223
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:19,789
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now. . . before it is too late.

1224
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:22,198
I have made my choice.

1225
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:31,113
He is not coming back.

1226
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,677
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1227
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:39,438
There is still hope.

1228
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:47,029
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1229
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:53,113
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king. . .

1230
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,669
. . .and all that you hope for
comes true. . .

1231
02:03:55,840 --> 02:04:00,356
. . .you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1232
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:03,518
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time. . .

1233
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:06,478
. . .Aragorn will die.

1234
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:11,668
And there will be no comfort
for you. . .

1235
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:15,879
. . . No comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.

1236
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,199
He will come to death. . .

1237
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:23,828
. . . An image of the splendor
of the kings of Men. . .

1238
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,471
. . .in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

1239
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:40,988
But you, my daughter. . .

1240
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:46,595
. . .you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt. . .

1241
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:50,673
. . . As nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

1242
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:55,269
Here you will dwell. . .

1243
02:04:55,440 --> 02:05:00,150
. . . Bound to your grief
under the fading trees. . .

1244
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:03,711
. . . Until all the world is changed. . .

1245
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:08,192
. . .and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1246
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:17,515
Arwen.

1247
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:26,075
There is nothing for you here. . .

1248
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:28,711
. . .only death.

1249
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:51,677
Do I not also have your love?

1250
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:54,872
You have my love, father.

1251
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:01,790
The power of the enemy is growing.

1252
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:04,474
Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman. . .

1253
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:07,950
. . . To destroy the people of Rohan.

1254
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:13,435
Isengard has been unleashed.

1255
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:20,791
The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor. . .

1256
02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:24,758
. . . The last free kingdom of Men.

1257
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:29,118
His war on this country
will come swiftly.

1258
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:35,672
He senses the Ring is close.

1259
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:39,150
The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.

1260
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:43,199
In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand. . .

1261
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:48,389
. . .the quest will claim his life.

1262
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:50,630
You know this.

1263
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:53,919
You have foreseen it.

1264
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:59,270
It is the risk we all took.

1265
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:07,519
In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.

1266
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:12,872
It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.

1267
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:18,273
Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.

1268
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:21,916
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand. . .

1269
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:25,993
. . . Take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

1270
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:30,072
It is close now.

1271
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:34,313
So close to achieving its goal.

1272
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:40,795
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth. . .

1273
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:44,919
. . . Even unto to the ending
of the world.

1274
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:48,432
The time of the Elves. . .

1275
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:50,471
. . .is over.

1276
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:54,716
Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?

1277
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:59,717
Do we let them stand alone?

1278
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:05,434
What news?

1279
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:08,319
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1280
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:11,199
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

1281
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:15,239
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1282
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:17,709
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1283
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:20,076
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1284
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:23,516
-How many?
-Some thousands. More come every day.

1285
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:27,996
-Who's covering the river to the north?
-We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1286
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:31,072
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1287
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:35,190
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1288
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:37,954
Sauron from Mordor.

1289
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:42,317
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

1290
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:44,118
Gondor is weak.

1291
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:47,272
Sauron will strike us soon.

1292
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,752
And he will strike hard.

1293
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:54,113
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1294
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:09,596
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1295
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:12,399
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1296
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:14,710
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1297
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:22,992
Speak.

1298
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:26,554
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1299
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:29,758
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1300
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,639
Your bodyguard?

1301
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:33,518
His gardener.

1302
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:35,991
And where is your skulking friend?

1303
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:39,670
That gangrel creature.

1304
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,877
He had an ill-favored look.

1305
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:45,351
There was no other.

1306
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:51,510
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1307
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:57,678
One we lost in Moria. . .

1308
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:00,153
. . .two were my kin. . .

1309
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:03,915
. . .a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1310
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:07,834
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1311
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:14,312
You're a friend of Boromir?

1312
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:18,073
Yes.

1313
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:20,155
For my part.

1314
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:29,233
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1315
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:32,599
Dead?

1316
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:34,716
How? When?

1317
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:37,520
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1318
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:41,475
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1319
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:50,309
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1320
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:53,478
It was cloven in two.

1321
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:58,356
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1322
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:02,038
He was my brother.

1323
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:51,832
Boromir!

1324
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:54,117
Boromir!

1325
02:12:58,200 --> 02:13:01,795
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

1326
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:05,475
A place of light and beauty and music.

1327
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:07,870
And so it shall be once more!

1328
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:12,880
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1329
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:17,238
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1330
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:26,318
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1331
02:13:26,680 --> 02:13:28,557
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!

1332
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:31,439
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!

1333
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:42,439
Good speech. Nice and short.

1334
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:45,398
Leaves more time for drinking!

1335
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:49,753
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1336
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:55,150
Remember today, little brother.

1337
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:58,198
Today, life is good.

1338
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:03,713
What?

1339
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:05,479
He's here.

1340
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:11,472
-Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
-Where is he?

1341
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:14,950
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1342
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:17,118
Father!

1343
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:24,035
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1344
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:27,476
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1345
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:31,678
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1346
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:34,635
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1347
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,756
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1348
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:38,558
Oh, too few.

1349
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,315
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1350
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:46,398
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1351
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:48,710
That is not my intent.

1352
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:52,475
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1353
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:58,518
-He loves you, Father.
-Do not trouble me with Faramir. . .

1354
02:14:58,680 --> 02:15:01,319
. . . I know his uses, and they are few.

1355
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:04,950
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1356
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:08,389
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1357
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:11,313
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1358
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:15,109
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1359
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:19,435
The One Ring.

1360
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:26,551
-Isildur's Bane.
-It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1361
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:30,190
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1362
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:34,319
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1363
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:38,600
-Gondor.
-It's dangerous, I know.

1364
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:42,309
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

1365
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:46,268
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1366
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:51,514
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1367
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:56,549
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1368
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:58,153
He will return.

1369
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:01,915
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1370
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:04,514
You must go.

1371
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:07,676
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1372
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:13,759
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1373
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:17,435
-Would you deny your own father?
-Lf there is need to go to Rivendell. . .

1374
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:20,478
-. . .send me in his stead.
-You?

1375
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:23,431
Oh, I see.

1376
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:27,639
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

1377
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:29,951
I think not.

1378
02:16:30,120 --> 02:16:32,873
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1379
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:35,838
The one who will not fail me.

1380
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:55,317
Remember today, little brother.

1381
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:14,831
Captain Faramir!

1382
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:18,076
We found the third one.

1383
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:31,031
You must come with me. Now.

1384
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:42,869
Down there.

1385
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:59,913
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1386
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:11,513
They wait for my command.

1387
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:17,835
Shall I shoot?

1388
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:21,918
The rock and pool
Is nice and cool

1389
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:23,832
So juicy sweet

1390
02:18:24,480 --> 02:18:27,313
Our only wish
To catch a fish

1391
02:18:27,480 --> 02:18:30,074
So juicy sweet

1392
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:38,119
Wait.

1393
02:18:39,560 --> 02:18:42,279
This creature is bound to me.

1394
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:44,711
And I to him.

1395
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:49,114
He is our guide.

1396
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:54,993
Please. . .

1397
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:56,957
. . .let me go down to him.

1398
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:09,352
Sméagol.

1399
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:12,470
Master is here.

1400
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:14,715
Come, Sméagol.

1401
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:20,000
Trust master. Come.

1402
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:26,715
We must go now?

1403
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:30,350
Sméagol, you must trust master.

1404
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:31,839
Follow me. Come on.

1405
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,558
Come.

1406
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:38,075
Come, Sméagol.

1407
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:40,551
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

1408
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:42,519
Come on.

1409
02:19:46,720 --> 02:19:48,312
Don't hurt him!

1410
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:51,119
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

1411
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:52,508
Master!

1412
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:18,955
That's enough.

1413
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:24,510
Where are you leading them?

1414
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,832
Answer me.

1415
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:31,712
Sméagol.

1416
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:39,591
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

1417
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:43,314
Cruel Men hurts us.

1418
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:46,358
Master tricksed us.

1419
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:49,910
Of course he did.

1420
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:53,829
I told you he was tricksy.

1421
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,912
I told you he was false.

1422
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:59,674
Master is our friend.

1423
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:02,070
Our friend.

1424
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:04,310
Master betrayed us.

1425
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:07,358
No. Not its business.

1426
02:21:08,400 --> 02:21:10,709
Leave us alone!

1427
02:21:10,880 --> 02:21:13,189
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1428
02:21:13,360 --> 02:21:15,555
They stole it from us!

1429
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:17,119
No. No.

1430
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:19,198
What did they steal?

1431
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:26,400
My precious!

1432
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:31,512
We have to get out of here.

1433
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:33,957
You go. Go, now.

1434
02:21:36,480 --> 02:21:38,232
You can do it.

1435
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:41,039
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1436
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:42,918
Just this once.

1437
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:44,798
Put it on.

1438
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:47,156
Disappear.

1439
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:49,195
I can't.

1440
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:54,276
You were right, Sam.

1441
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:58,069
You tried to tell me but. . . .

1442
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:04,630
I'm sorry.

1443
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,753
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1444
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:14,712
If I put it on. . .

1445
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:17,110
. . . he'll find me.

1446
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:20,597
He'll see.

1447
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:23,671
Mr. Frodo. . . .

1448
02:22:28,400 --> 02:22:32,473
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1449
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:37,478
Here in the Wild I have you. . .

1450
02:22:37,640 --> 02:22:39,471
. . .two Halflings. . .

1451
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:42,677
. . .and a host of men at my call.

1452
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:49,196
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1453
02:22:58,480 --> 02:23:02,075
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor. . .

1454
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:06,512
. . .to show his quality.

1455
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:28,318
No!

1456
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:32,634
Stop it!

1457
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:33,789
Leave him alone.

1458
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:37,469
Don't you understand?

1459
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:40,551
He's got to destroy it!

1460
02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:43,837
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1461
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:45,592
To the Mountain of Fire!

1462
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:49,592
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1463
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:52,638
Please. It's such a burden.

1464
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:56,711
Will you not help him?

1465
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,831
Captain?

1466
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:02,596
Prepare to leave.

1467
02:24:07,360 --> 02:24:09,669
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1468
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,240
-He's alive!
-Where is he? Where is he?

1469
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:25,312
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1470
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:29,109
You are the luckiest, the canniest. . .

1471
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:33,114
. . .and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1472
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:35,193
Bless you, laddie.

1473
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:37,432
Gimli, where is the king?

1474
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:47,069
You're late.

1475
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:51,914
You look terrible.

1476
02:26:31,960 --> 02:26:33,916
A great host, you say?

1477
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:36,640
-All Isengard is emptied.
-How many?

1478
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:40,158
Ten thousand strong at least.

1479
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:43,039
Ten thousand?

1480
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:45,829
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1481
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:50,436
To destroy the world of Men.

1482
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:54,751
They will be here by nightfall.

1483
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:01,588
Let them come!

1484
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:05,713
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms. . .

1485
02:27:05,880 --> 02:27:08,872
. . .to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1486
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:19,598
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1487
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:22,069
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall. . .

1488
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:24,879
. . .or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1489
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:27,349
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1490
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:30,036
These are Uruk-hai.

1491
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:33,476
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1492
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:38,555
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1493
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:42,190
I know how to defend my own keep.

1494
02:27:48,520 --> 02:27:51,796
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1495
02:27:51,960 --> 02:27:56,954
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1496
02:27:57,160 --> 02:27:59,720
Crops can be resown. . .

1497
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:02,758
. . . homes rebuilt.

1498
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:05,794
Within these walls. . .

1499
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:07,593
. . .we will outlast them.

1500
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:10,069
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1501
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:11,719
They come to destroy its people. . .

1502
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:14,269
. . .down to the last child.

1503
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:17,270
What would you have me do?

1504
02:28:17,440 --> 02:28:19,112
Look at my men.

1505
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:20,952
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1506
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:27,272
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end. . .

1507
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:30,352
. . .as to be worthy of remembrance.

1508
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:35,671
Send out riders, my lord.

1509
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:38,713
You must call for aid.

1510
02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:43,990
And who will come?

1511
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:45,913
Elves?

1512
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:48,071
Dwarves?

1513
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:51,553
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1514
02:28:52,360 --> 02:28:54,555
The old alliances are dead.

1515
02:28:54,960 --> 02:28:57,633
-Gondor will answer.
-Gondor?!

1516
02:28:57,800 --> 02:28:59,916
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1517
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:03,957
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1518
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:05,951
Where was Gon--?

1519
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:10,397
No, my Lord Aragorn. . .

1520
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:14,275
. . .we are alone.

1521
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:22,552
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1522
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:23,914
We need more time
to lay provisions--

1523
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:27,436
There is no time. War is upon us.

1524
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:29,318
Secure the gate.

1525
02:29:34,320 --> 02:29:36,311
We Ents have not troubled. . .

1526
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:39,751
. . .about the wars of Men and wizards. . .

1527
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:43,358
. . .for a very long time.

1528
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:49,111
But now, something
is about to happen. . .

1529
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:51,510
. . .that has not happened. . .

1530
02:29:51,720 --> 02:29:54,075
. . .for an age.

1531
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:57,390
Entmoot.

1532
02:29:57,800 --> 02:29:58,789
What's that?

1533
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:01,919
'Tis a gathering.

1534
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:05,508
A gathering of what?

1535
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:24,950
Beech. Oak.

1536
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:26,951
Chestnut. Ash.

1537
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:29,111
Good. Good. Good.

1538
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:31,510
Many have come.

1539
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:41,433
Now we must decide
if the Ents. . .

1540
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:44,034
. . .will go to war.

1541
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:55,552
Move back! Move to the caves!

1542
02:30:57,920 --> 02:30:59,911
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1543
02:31:00,320 --> 02:31:02,515
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1544
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:04,875
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1545
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:08,032
Aragorn, you must rest.

1546
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:10,509
You're no use to us half alive.

1547
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:12,109
Aragorn!

1548
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:18,272
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1549
02:31:18,440 --> 02:31:20,032
That is an honorable charge.

1550
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:22,953
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1551
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:24,758
What renown is there in that?

1552
02:31:24,920 --> 02:31:28,469
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1553
02:31:28,720 --> 02:31:31,393
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1554
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:36,350
-Let me stand at your side.
-It is not in my power to command it.

1555
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:39,359
You do not command
the others to stay!

1556
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:43,115
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1557
02:31:44,240 --> 02:31:46,356
Because they love you.

1558
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:54,639
I'm sorry.

1559
02:32:57,840 --> 02:33:00,991
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1560
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:03,758
These are no soldiers.

1561
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:09,276
-Most have seen too many winters.
-Or too few.

1562
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:15,838
Look at them. They're frightened.

1563
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:17,399
I can see it in their eyes.

1564
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:24,311
And they should be. . .

1565
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:27,472
Three hundred. . . against ten thousand!

1566
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:31,680
They have more hope of defending
themselves here than at Edoras. . .

1567
02:33:32,640 --> 02:33:35,200
They cannot win this fight.

1568
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:37,308
They are all going to die!

1569
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:39,596
Then I shall die as one of them!

1570
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:47,512
Let him go, lad.

1571
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:49,957
Let him be.

1572
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:56,639
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1573
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:02,551
My lord?

1574
02:34:04,520 --> 02:34:06,988
Who am I , Gamling?

1575
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:13,949
You are our king, sire.

1576
02:34:16,840 --> 02:34:19,991
And do you trust your king?

1577
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:24,477
Your men, my lord. . .

1578
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:27,359
. . .will follow you to whatever end.

1579
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:35,751
To whatever end.

1580
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:48,636
Where is the horse and the rider?

1581
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:51,712
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1582
02:34:53,160 --> 02:34:57,438
They have passed like rain
on the mountains.

1583
02:34:58,400 --> 02:35:01,472
Like wind in the meadow.

1584
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:08,629
The days have gone down in the West. . .

1585
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:11,840
. . . Behind the hills. . .

1586
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:15,198
. . .into Shadow.

1587
02:35:23,320 --> 02:35:26,596
How did it come to this?

1588
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:48,792
It's been going for hours.

1589
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:52,229
They must have decided something
by now.

1590
02:35:52,400 --> 02:35:56,313
Decided? No.

1591
02:35:56,480 --> 02:36:01,429
We only just finished saying. . .

1592
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:04,357
. . .good morning.

1593
02:36:05,640 --> 02:36:08,712
But it's nighttime already.

1594
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:10,598
You can't take forever.

1595
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:13,551
Don't be hasty.

1596
02:36:13,960 --> 02:36:16,269
We're running out of time!

1597
02:36:19,160 --> 02:36:21,993
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1598
02:36:38,840 --> 02:36:40,114
Give me your sword.

1599
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:50,349
What is your name?

1600
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:53,110
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

1601
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:57,714
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.

1602
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:01,477
They say that it is hopeless.

1603
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:20,152
This is a good sword.

1604
02:37:22,080 --> 02:37:24,310
Haleth, son of Háma. . .

1605
02:37:28,480 --> 02:37:30,550
. . .there is always hope.

1606
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:55,831
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1607
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:57,479
Forgive me.

1608
02:37:57,640 --> 02:37:59,039
I was wrong to despair.

1609
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:04,469
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

1610
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:10,559
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1611
02:38:13,840 --> 02:38:15,831
It's a little tight across the chest.

1612
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:23,637
That is no Orc horn.

1613
02:38:29,080 --> 02:38:30,832
Send for the king.

1614
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:34,436
-Open the gate!
-Open up the gate!

1615
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:06,392
How is this possible?

1616
02:39:07,360 --> 02:39:10,875
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1617
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:14,112
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1618
02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:18,873
Long ago we fought and died together.

1619
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:23,838
We come to honor that allegiance.

1620
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:33,791
You are most welcome.

1621
02:39:38,960 --> 02:39:42,475
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1622
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:18,117
You could have picked a better spot.

1623
02:40:22,760 --> 02:40:26,799
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1624
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:34,398
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1625
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,389
Let's hope they last the night.

1626
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:38,515
Show them no mercy. . .

1627
02:41:39,480 --> 02:41:41,675
For you shall receive none!

1628
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:17,399
-What's happening out there?
-Shall I describe it to you?

1629
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:20,318
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1630
02:42:58,120 --> 02:42:59,348
HOLD!

1631
02:43:20,920 --> 02:43:22,672
So it begins.

1632
02:43:28,320 --> 02:43:29,435
Prepare to fire!

1633
02:43:38,080 --> 02:43:40,196
Their armour is weak at the neck. . .

1634
02:43:40,360 --> 02:43:41,793
And beneath the arm.

1635
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:43,672
Release Arrows!

1636
02:43:48,440 --> 02:43:49,714
Did they hit anything?

1637
02:43:50,360 --> 02:43:52,271
Give them a volley.

1638
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:54,476
-Fire!
-Fire!

1639
02:44:09,560 --> 02:44:11,152
Send them to me! Come on!

1640
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:30,909
Ladders!

1641
02:44:31,080 --> 02:44:32,115
Good!

1642
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:41,518
Swords! Swords!

1643
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:20,076
Legolas! Two already!

1644
02:45:20,240 --> 02:45:22,276
I'm on 17!

1645
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:24,908
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1646
02:45:31,440 --> 02:45:33,078
Nineteen!

1647
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,353
Merry.

1648
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:07,229
We have just agreed.

1649
02:46:16,840 --> 02:46:18,239
Yes?

1650
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:23,673
I have told your names to the Entmoot. . .

1651
02:46:24,760 --> 02:46:27,877
. . .and we have agreed. . .

1652
02:46:28,320 --> 02:46:32,199
. . .you are not Orcs.

1653
02:46:33,880 --> 02:46:35,916
Well, that's good news.

1654
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:40,039
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1655
02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:44,269
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1656
02:46:44,440 --> 02:46:45,919
Hasty?

1657
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:48,477
Our friends are out there.

1658
02:46:48,640 --> 02:46:52,633
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1659
02:46:52,960 --> 02:46:55,155
War? Yes.

1660
02:46:55,320 --> 02:46:57,117
It affects us all.

1661
02:46:57,280 --> 02:47:00,158
Tree, root and twig.

1662
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:04,879
But you must understand, young Hobbit. . .

1663
02:47:05,080 --> 02:47:06,911
. . .it takes a long time. . .

1664
02:47:07,080 --> 02:47:11,790
. . .to say anything in Old Entish. . .

1665
02:47:11,960 --> 02:47:15,999
. . .and we never say anything. . .

1666
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:19,914
. . . unless it is worth taking. . .

1667
02:47:20,080 --> 02:47:23,959
. . .a long time to say.

1668
02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:27,871
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1669
02:47:28,040 --> 02:47:29,075
Nineteen!

1670
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:31,397
Twenty!

1671
02:47:31,560 --> 02:47:33,152
Twenty-one!

1672
02:47:42,840 --> 02:47:44,751
Causeway!

1673
02:47:52,200 --> 02:47:54,475
Is this it?

1674
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:57,438
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1675
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:24,079
Bring him down, Legolas!

1676
02:48:27,280 --> 02:48:28,076
Kill him!

1677
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:29,229
Kill him!

1678
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:21,239
Brace the gate!

1679
02:49:38,800 --> 02:49:40,950
Hold them! Stand firm!

1680
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:49,794
Aragorn!

1681
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:55,389
Gimli!

1682
02:50:05,560 --> 02:50:06,549
Charge!

1683
02:50:42,160 --> 02:50:45,914
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1684
02:50:46,680 --> 02:50:50,514
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1685
02:50:51,320 --> 02:50:53,311
How can that be your decision?!

1686
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:57,430
This is not our war.

1687
02:50:57,720 --> 02:50:59,836
But you're part of this world!

1688
02:51:03,800 --> 02:51:05,552
Aren't you?!

1689
02:51:09,480 --> 02:51:11,755
You must help. Please.

1690
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,639
You must do something.

1691
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:20,038
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1692
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:24,749
But your part in this tale is over.

1693
02:51:24,920 --> 02:51:27,070
Go back to your home.

1694
02:51:36,680 --> 02:51:38,830
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1695
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:40,797
We don't belong here, Merry.

1696
02:51:40,960 --> 02:51:43,155
It's too big for us.

1697
02:51:43,320 --> 02:51:45,880
What can we do in the end?

1698
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:50,594
We've got the Shire.

1699
02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:53,554
Maybe we should go home.

1700
02:51:55,320 --> 02:51:58,392
The fires of Isengard will spread. . .

1701
02:51:58,560 --> 02:52:03,270
. . .and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1702
02:52:03,440 --> 02:52:04,953
And. . . .

1703
02:52:06,680 --> 02:52:09,638
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1704
02:52:13,040 --> 02:52:15,838
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1705
02:52:34,560 --> 02:52:35,754
Aragorn!

1706
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:38,195
Fall back to the Keep!

1707
02:52:38,360 --> 02:52:41,318
Get your men out of there!

1708
02:52:42,400 --> 02:52:43,833
To the Keep!

1709
02:52:48,480 --> 02:52:50,038
Pull back to the Keep!

1710
02:52:50,560 --> 02:52:52,152
Haldir!

1711
02:52:52,920 --> 02:52:54,319
To the Keep!

1712
02:52:56,120 --> 02:52:59,237
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1713
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:18,829
Haldir!

1714
02:53:59,800 --> 02:54:01,233
Brace the gate!

1715
02:54:03,360 --> 02:54:04,588
Hold them!

1716
02:54:06,360 --> 02:54:09,591
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1717
02:54:36,600 --> 02:54:38,431
Make way!

1718
02:54:41,240 --> 02:54:42,878
We cannot hold much longer!

1719
02:54:48,600 --> 02:54:52,036
-Hold them!
-How long do you need?

1720
02:54:52,200 --> 02:54:54,668
As long as you can give me.

1721
02:54:54,840 --> 02:54:56,432
Gimli!

1722
02:54:57,840 --> 02:54:59,159
Timbers!

1723
02:54:59,320 --> 02:55:01,197
Brace the gate!

1724
02:55:15,360 --> 02:55:16,998
Come on. We can take them.

1725
02:55:17,800 --> 02:55:19,358
It's a long way.

1726
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:26,072
Toss me.

1727
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:28,952
-What?
-I cannot jump the distance!

1728
02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:30,633
You'll have to toss me!

1729
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:37,228
Don't tell the Elf.

1730
02:55:37,720 --> 02:55:39,438
Not a word.

1731
02:55:54,040 --> 02:55:55,439
Shore up the door!

1732
02:55:55,600 --> 02:55:57,591
-Make way!
-Follow me to the barricade.

1733
02:55:57,760 --> 02:55:58,795
Watch our backs!

1734
02:56:02,760 --> 02:56:04,910
-Throw another one over here!
-Higher!

1735
02:56:52,800 --> 02:56:54,153
Hold fast the gate!

1736
02:56:58,200 --> 02:57:01,033
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1737
02:57:05,560 --> 02:57:07,118
Aragorn!

1738
02:57:39,160 --> 02:57:41,515
Pull everybody back.

1739
02:57:41,880 --> 02:57:43,598
Pull them back.

1740
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:45,519
Fall back!

1741
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:48,069
Fall back!

1742
02:57:49,200 --> 02:57:50,838
They have broken through!

1743
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,150
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1744
02:57:53,320 --> 02:57:55,470
-Fall back!
-Retreat!

1745
02:57:55,640 --> 02:57:58,108
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1746
02:57:58,280 --> 02:58:00,430
Into the Keep!

1747
02:58:11,440 --> 02:58:16,195
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1748
02:58:16,360 --> 02:58:20,876
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1749
02:58:26,360 --> 02:58:27,588
Wait! Stop!

1750
02:58:28,440 --> 02:58:29,873
Stop!

1751
02:58:32,880 --> 02:58:34,518
Turn around.

1752
02:58:35,400 --> 02:58:37,994
-Turn around. Take us south.
-South?

1753
02:58:38,160 --> 02:58:42,950
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1754
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:45,874
Yes. Exactly.

1755
02:58:46,040 --> 02:58:49,112
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1756
02:58:49,280 --> 02:58:51,840
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1757
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:53,911
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1758
02:58:56,440 --> 02:58:59,318
That doesn't make sense to me.

1759
02:58:59,480 --> 02:59:00,595
But then. . .

1760
02:59:00,760 --> 02:59:03,354
. . .you are very small.

1761
02:59:03,800 --> 02:59:05,518
Perhaps you're right.

1762
02:59:08,040 --> 02:59:09,519
South it is, then.

1763
02:59:10,960 --> 02:59:14,157
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1764
02:59:16,120 --> 02:59:18,759
I always like going south.

1765
02:59:18,920 --> 02:59:23,038
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1766
02:59:23,640 --> 02:59:25,995
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1767
02:59:26,160 --> 02:59:27,991
No, we won't.

1768
02:59:28,720 --> 02:59:30,870
Not this time.

1769
02:59:37,240 --> 02:59:38,229
Look!

1770
02:59:39,800 --> 02:59:42,155
Osgiliath burns!

1771
02:59:42,320 --> 02:59:43,673
Mordor has come.

1772
02:59:44,760 --> 02:59:47,069
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1773
02:59:48,360 --> 02:59:50,476
It has only the power to destroy.

1774
02:59:51,320 --> 02:59:52,719
Please. . .

1775
02:59:52,880 --> 02:59:54,438
. . .let me go.

1776
02:59:55,440 --> 02:59:56,953
Hurry.

1777
03:00:00,280 --> 03:00:01,633
Faramir!

1778
03:00:01,800 --> 03:00:04,189
You must let me go!

1779
03:00:04,600 --> 03:00:07,910
And those little family of field mice. . .

1780
03:00:08,080 --> 03:00:10,799
. . .that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1781
03:00:11,480 --> 03:00:14,677
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they. . . .

1782
03:00:25,400 --> 03:00:28,198
Many of these trees were my friends.

1783
03:00:28,880 --> 03:00:33,317
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1784
03:00:34,440 --> 03:00:35,589
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1785
03:00:35,760 --> 03:00:38,399
They had voices of their own.

1786
03:00:40,560 --> 03:00:42,994
Saruman.

1787
03:00:43,320 --> 03:00:46,278
A wizard should know better!

1788
03:00:59,960 --> 03:01:03,475
There is no curse in Elvish. . .

1789
03:01:03,640 --> 03:01:06,200
. . . Entish or the tongues of Men. . .

1790
03:01:06,360 --> 03:01:08,590
. . .for this treachery.

1791
03:01:09,960 --> 03:01:12,679
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1792
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:18,349
Where are they going?

1793
03:01:18,840 --> 03:01:21,957
They have business with the Orcs.

1794
03:01:22,400 --> 03:01:26,518
My business is with Isengard tonight. . .

1795
03:01:26,680 --> 03:01:29,194
. . .with rock and stone.

1796
03:01:52,120 --> 03:01:53,235
Yes.

1797
03:01:54,280 --> 03:01:55,633
Come, my friends.

1798
03:01:56,920 --> 03:02:00,959
The Ents are going to war.

1799
03:02:01,120 --> 03:02:02,838
It is likely. . .

1800
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:06,356
. . .that we go to our doom.

1801
03:02:07,720 --> 03:02:10,075
Last march. . .

1802
03:02:10,600 --> 03:02:12,556
. . .of the Ents.

1803
03:02:58,680 --> 03:03:02,275
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1804
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:04,431
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1805
03:03:07,080 --> 03:03:08,479
Mr. Frodo?

1806
03:03:08,760 --> 03:03:12,719
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1807
03:03:12,880 --> 03:03:15,269
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1808
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:30,353
Take them to my father.

1809
03:03:31,840 --> 03:03:34,718
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1810
03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:39,952
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1811
03:03:41,080 --> 03:03:43,640
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1812
03:03:44,280 --> 03:03:46,919
You want to know
why your brother died?

1813
03:03:47,400 --> 03:03:50,995
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1814
03:03:51,160 --> 03:03:52,957
He tried to kill him!

1815
03:03:53,120 --> 03:03:55,350
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1816
03:03:56,120 --> 03:03:57,872
Watch out!

1817
03:04:08,360 --> 03:04:09,429
Mr. Frodo?

1818
03:04:11,960 --> 03:04:13,712
They're here.

1819
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:19,075
They've come.

1820
03:04:21,560 --> 03:04:23,357
NazgûI!

1821
03:04:44,600 --> 03:04:46,670
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1822
03:04:48,400 --> 03:04:50,516
Take cover!

1823
03:05:07,160 --> 03:05:08,639
The fortress is taken.

1824
03:05:09,400 --> 03:05:10,515
It is over.

1825
03:05:10,680 --> 03:05:14,468
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1826
03:05:14,640 --> 03:05:17,438
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1827
03:05:20,080 --> 03:05:21,399
They're breaking in!

1828
03:05:23,960 --> 03:05:26,349
They're past the door!

1829
03:05:29,560 --> 03:05:33,519
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1830
03:05:36,080 --> 03:05:37,911
Is there no other way?

1831
03:05:39,440 --> 03:05:42,352
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1832
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,116
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1833
03:05:49,800 --> 03:05:52,109
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1834
03:05:52,280 --> 03:05:54,999
-And barricade the entrance!
-So much death.

1835
03:05:57,080 --> 03:06:00,356
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1836
03:06:04,840 --> 03:06:06,193
Ride out with me.

1837
03:06:10,160 --> 03:06:11,718
Ride out and meet them.

1838
03:06:12,440 --> 03:06:14,510
For death and glory.

1839
03:06:14,680 --> 03:06:16,033
For Rohan.

1840
03:06:17,480 --> 03:06:18,879
For your people.

1841
03:06:19,600 --> 03:06:21,431
The sun is rising.

1842
03:06:25,760 --> 03:06:28,638
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

1843
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:30,153
At dawn. . .

1844
03:06:30,320 --> 03:06:31,958
. . . Look to the east.

1845
03:06:35,960 --> 03:06:37,552
Yes.

1846
03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:41,512
Yes.

1847
03:06:42,800 --> 03:06:45,075
The horn of Helm Hammerhand. . .

1848
03:06:45,240 --> 03:06:47,959
. . .shall sound in the Deep. . .

1849
03:06:48,360 --> 03:06:50,271
. . .one last time.

1850
03:06:50,440 --> 03:06:51,873
Yes!

1851
03:06:54,800 --> 03:06:58,429
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1852
03:07:05,880 --> 03:07:07,154
Fell deeds, awake.

1853
03:07:08,320 --> 03:07:09,389
Now for wrath. . .

1854
03:07:09,560 --> 03:07:12,791
. . . now for ruin and a red dawn.

1855
03:07:19,560 --> 03:07:21,710
Forth Eorlingas!

1856
03:08:07,560 --> 03:08:08,754
Gandalf.

1857
03:08:15,720 --> 03:08:19,235
Théoden King stands alone.

1858
03:08:19,800 --> 03:08:21,870
Not alone.

1859
03:08:22,280 --> 03:08:23,349
Rohirrim!

1860
03:08:29,040 --> 03:08:30,155
Éomer.

1861
03:08:30,320 --> 03:08:32,754
To the king!

1862
03:09:47,160 --> 03:09:48,878
Yes!

1863
03:09:57,640 --> 03:10:00,916
A hit. A fine hit.

1864
03:10:24,480 --> 03:10:26,835
Break the dam!

1865
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:30,310
Release the river!

1866
03:10:56,520 --> 03:10:59,159
Pippin! Hold on!

1867
03:11:04,200 --> 03:11:06,998
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1868
03:11:46,680 --> 03:11:48,591
What are you doing?

1869
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:58,353
Where are you going?

1870
03:12:54,120 --> 03:12:55,394
It's me.

1871
03:12:57,800 --> 03:12:59,916
It's your Sam.

1872
03:13:04,080 --> 03:13:06,594
Don't you know your Sam?

1873
03:13:23,600 --> 03:13:26,831
I can't do this, Sam.

1874
03:13:27,680 --> 03:13:29,591
I know.

1875
03:13:30,560 --> 03:13:32,835
It's all wrong.

1876
03:13:33,560 --> 03:13:35,471
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1877
03:13:42,600 --> 03:13:44,591
But we are.

1878
03:13:50,760 --> 03:13:53,672
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1879
03:13:53,840 --> 03:13:56,115
The ones that really mattered.

1880
03:13:57,120 --> 03:13:59,998
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1881
03:14:00,160 --> 03:14:02,993
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end. . .

1882
03:14:03,160 --> 03:14:05,993
. . .because how could the end be happy?

1883
03:14:08,440 --> 03:14:10,556
How could the world go back
to the way it was. . .

1884
03:14:10,720 --> 03:14:14,076
. . . When so much bad had happened?

1885
03:14:14,880 --> 03:14:16,711
Victory!

1886
03:14:16,880 --> 03:14:18,359
We have victory!

1887
03:14:18,520 --> 03:14:22,308
But in the end,
it's only a passing thing. . .

1888
03:14:22,480 --> 03:14:23,754
. . . This shadow.

1889
03:14:23,920 --> 03:14:26,195
Even darkness must pass.

1890
03:14:26,360 --> 03:14:28,954
A new day will come.

1891
03:14:29,120 --> 03:14:32,908
And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.

1892
03:14:34,760 --> 03:14:37,035
Those were the stories
that stayed with you. . .

1893
03:14:37,200 --> 03:14:38,872
. . . That meant something.

1894
03:14:39,040 --> 03:14:41,508
Even if you were too small
to understand why.

1895
03:14:42,840 --> 03:14:46,515
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1896
03:14:46,680 --> 03:14:48,193
I know now.

1897
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:51,116
Folk in those stories. . .

1898
03:14:51,280 --> 03:14:55,239
. . . had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1899
03:14:55,400 --> 03:14:57,550
They kept going. . .

1900
03:14:58,200 --> 03:15:01,317
. . .because they were holding
on to something.

1901
03:15:02,840 --> 03:15:05,070
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1902
03:15:16,520 --> 03:15:20,274
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1903
03:15:20,560 --> 03:15:23,074
And it's worth fighting for.

1904
03:15:48,880 --> 03:15:52,998
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1905
03:15:53,720 --> 03:15:57,508
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1906
03:15:57,680 --> 03:15:59,796
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1907
03:16:03,960 --> 03:16:05,313
Then it is forfeit.

1908
03:16:07,960 --> 03:16:09,678
Release them.

1909
03:16:21,240 --> 03:16:23,196
Stay out of the forest!

1910
03:16:23,360 --> 03:16:25,078
Keep away from the trees!

1911
03:17:13,840 --> 03:17:15,558
Final count. . .

1912
03:17:15,720 --> 03:17:18,518
-. . .42.
-Forty-two?

1913
03:17:19,920 --> 03:17:24,471
That's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

1914
03:17:25,240 --> 03:17:28,755
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1915
03:17:32,720 --> 03:17:35,871
-Forty-three.
-He was already dead.

1916
03:17:36,600 --> 03:17:38,989
-He was twitching.
-He was twitching. . .

1917
03:17:39,160 --> 03:17:43,676
. . .because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

1918
03:17:45,800 --> 03:17:50,316
-He doesn't look too happy, does he?
-Not too happy at all, Merry.

1919
03:17:50,560 --> 03:17:53,950
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

1920
03:17:54,120 --> 03:17:56,953
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1921
03:17:57,120 --> 03:17:59,839
I hear the staff are very good.

1922
03:18:05,280 --> 03:18:07,555
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

1923
03:18:07,720 --> 03:18:11,793
-The world's back to normal, that's all.
-No, it isn't.

1924
03:18:11,960 --> 03:18:13,154
I'm starving.

1925
03:18:13,320 --> 03:18:16,278
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

1926
03:18:16,440 --> 03:18:19,398
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1927
03:18:42,360 --> 03:18:44,669
Saruman's storeroom!

1928
03:18:46,920 --> 03:18:49,559
I don't believe it.

1929
03:18:49,720 --> 03:18:51,676
It can't be.

1930
03:18:52,280 --> 03:18:55,033
-It is!
-Longbottom Leaf.

1931
03:18:56,280 --> 03:18:58,510
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1932
03:18:58,840 --> 03:19:01,832
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1933
03:19:02,000 --> 03:19:03,069
Wait.

1934
03:19:03,800 --> 03:19:04,949
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

1935
03:19:05,120 --> 03:19:06,599
Share it?

1936
03:19:08,360 --> 03:19:10,669
No. No.

1937
03:19:12,120 --> 03:19:13,394
Dead plant and all that.

1938
03:19:13,800 --> 03:19:15,870
Don't think he'd understand.

1939
03:19:17,080 --> 03:19:19,196
Could be a distant relative.

1940
03:19:19,960 --> 03:19:22,349
I get it.

1941
03:19:22,520 --> 03:19:25,239
Don't be hasty.

1942
03:19:26,280 --> 03:19:27,952
Exactly.

1943
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:31,150
Bar-hrum.

1944
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:56,988
This is the old sewer.

1945
03:19:57,160 --> 03:20:00,152
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1946
03:20:00,320 --> 03:20:01,992
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1947
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:05,389
Captain Faramir. . .

1948
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:07,752
. . .you have shown your quality, sir.

1949
03:20:10,160 --> 03:20:11,388
The very highest.

1950
03:20:11,880 --> 03:20:14,394
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee. . .

1951
03:20:14,560 --> 03:20:17,393
. . .where gardeners are held in high honor.

1952
03:20:18,520 --> 03:20:20,431
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1953
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:22,513
Gollum says there's a path. . .

1954
03:20:22,680 --> 03:20:26,434
. . . near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

1955
03:20:26,880 --> 03:20:28,552
Cirith Ungol?

1956
03:20:31,960 --> 03:20:34,394
-Is that its name?
-No.

1957
03:20:34,560 --> 03:20:36,152
No!

1958
03:20:36,960 --> 03:20:39,838
-Yes.
-Frodo. . .

1959
03:20:40,200 --> 03:20:43,590
. . .they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1960
03:20:44,440 --> 03:20:46,874
-You cannot go that way.
-It is the only way.

1961
03:20:47,200 --> 03:20:53,230
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

1962
03:20:54,680 --> 03:20:56,398
I must.

1963
03:20:59,800 --> 03:21:03,236
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1964
03:21:03,400 --> 03:21:05,356
Thank you.

1965
03:21:16,680 --> 03:21:20,639
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

1966
03:21:32,600 --> 03:21:34,079
Come on, keep up.

1967
03:21:37,400 --> 03:21:40,073
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

1968
03:21:40,680 --> 03:21:42,432
You know that, don't you?

1969
03:21:43,200 --> 03:21:44,713
He was trying to save you, see?

1970
03:21:45,200 --> 03:21:46,679
Save me?

1971
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:49,070
So there's no hard feelings.

1972
03:21:49,240 --> 03:21:54,155
-Forgive and forget.
-No, no, no hard feelings.

1973
03:21:54,320 --> 03:21:56,834
Gollum, Gollum.

1974
03:21:57,840 --> 03:21:59,512
Yes, master.

1975
03:22:00,560 --> 03:22:03,279
-Nice Hobbits.
-Very decent of you.

1976
03:22:03,440 --> 03:22:05,635
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

1977
03:22:10,920 --> 03:22:15,914
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1978
03:22:22,760 --> 03:22:25,638
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1979
03:22:26,280 --> 03:22:29,670
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1980
03:22:34,600 --> 03:22:37,876
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits. . .

1981
03:22:38,840 --> 03:22:41,912
. . . Somewhere in the wilderness.

1982
03:22:45,080 --> 03:22:48,356
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1983
03:22:48,520 --> 03:22:49,839
What?

1984
03:22:50,000 --> 03:22:53,788
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

1985
03:22:53,960 --> 03:22:57,077
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1986
03:22:57,240 --> 03:23:00,073
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1987
03:23:00,240 --> 03:23:01,832
"Yes, my boy.

1988
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:05,629
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1989
03:23:05,800 --> 03:23:08,234
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1990
03:23:08,400 --> 03:23:10,197
"Samwise the Brave."

1991
03:23:10,360 --> 03:23:12,999
I want to hear more about Sam.

1992
03:23:17,120 --> 03:23:19,998
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1993
03:23:21,280 --> 03:23:25,159
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1994
03:23:26,200 --> 03:23:27,519
So was I.

1995
03:23:36,040 --> 03:23:38,634
"Samwise the Brave."

1996
03:23:42,720 --> 03:23:43,994
Sméagol?

1997
03:23:44,160 --> 03:23:46,958
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

1998
03:23:47,120 --> 03:23:48,951
Master.

1999
03:23:49,120 --> 03:23:51,953
Master looks after us.

2000
03:23:52,720 --> 03:23:55,393
Master wouldn't hurt us.

2001
03:23:55,560 --> 03:23:57,915
Master broke his promise.

2002
03:23:58,080 --> 03:24:00,150
Don't ask Sméagol.

2003
03:24:00,320 --> 03:24:03,392
Poor, poor Sméagol.

2004
03:24:03,560 --> 03:24:06,279
Master betrayed us.

2005
03:24:06,440 --> 03:24:09,398
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

2006
03:24:09,560 --> 03:24:13,314
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

2007
03:24:13,480 --> 03:24:16,119
Kill him! Kill him!

2008
03:24:16,280 --> 03:24:17,713
Kill them both!

2009
03:24:17,880 --> 03:24:21,350
And then we take the precious. . .

2010
03:24:21,520 --> 03:24:24,910
. . .and we be the master!

2011
03:24:25,560 --> 03:24:28,120
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

2012
03:24:28,280 --> 03:24:30,840
Eyes always watching.

2013
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:34,390
Then we stabs them out.

2014
03:24:34,560 --> 03:24:38,872
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

2015
03:24:39,040 --> 03:24:42,350
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2016
03:24:42,520 --> 03:24:45,114
Kill them both.

2017
03:24:45,280 --> 03:24:47,669
Yes. No! No!

2018
03:24:47,840 --> 03:24:51,389
It's too risky. It's too risky.

2019
03:24:52,080 --> 03:24:54,548
Where is he? Where has he gone?

2020
03:24:54,720 --> 03:24:57,234
-Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
-Sméagol?

2021
03:24:57,400 --> 03:25:02,554
We could let her do it.

2022
03:25:03,480 --> 03:25:07,473
Yes. She could do it.

2023
03:25:07,640 --> 03:25:11,997
Yes, precious, she could.

2024
03:25:12,160 --> 03:25:17,951
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

2025
03:25:18,840 --> 03:25:21,559
Once they're dead.

2026
03:25:25,800 --> 03:25:29,349
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

2027
03:25:29,520 --> 03:25:31,476
Sméagol will show you the way.

2028
03:25:31,640 --> 03:25:33,790
Follow me.

2029
03:33:20,960 --> 03:33:21,949
