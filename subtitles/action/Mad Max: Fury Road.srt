1
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,653
<i> My name is Max.</i>

2
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,690
<i> My world is fire and blood.</i>

3
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,759
<i> Why are you hurting  these people?</i>

4
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,328
<i> It's the oil, stupid.
</i><i> Oil wars.</i>

5
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,564
<i> We are killing for guzzoline.
</i><i> Guzzoline.</i>

6
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,666
<i> The world is actually
running out of water.</i>

7
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,602
<i> Now there's the water wars.</i>

8
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:40,238
Once, I was a cop,</i>

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,174
<i> a road warrior searching  for
a righteous cause.</i>

10
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,010
<i>...To the terminal  freak-out point.</i>

11
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:48,012
<i> Mankind has gone rogue,
terrorizing itself.</i>

12
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,747
<i> Thermonuclear skirmish.</i>

13
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,215
<i> The earth is sour.</i>

14
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,883
<i> Our bones are poisoned.</i>

15
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:54,618
<i> We have become half-life.</i>

16
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,721
<i> As the world fell,</i>

17
00:00:57,723 --> 00:01:01,258
<i> each of us, in our own way,  was broken.</i>

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,795
<i> It was hard to know  who was more crazy...</i>

19
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,833
<i>...me or everyone else.</i>

20
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,638
<i> Hello?</i>

21
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,108
<i> Where are you?</i>

22
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,216
<i> Where are you, Max?</i> <i> Max.</i>

23
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:28,586
<i> Here they come again.  Max rockatansky.</i>

24
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,156
<i> Worming their way into  the black
matter of my brain.</i>

25
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,325
<i> Help us, Max.  You promised to help us.</i>

26
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,662
<i> I tell myself...</i>

27
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:43,066
<i>...they cannot touch me.</i>

28
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:46,035
<i> They are long dead.</i>

29
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:12,929
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

30
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:19,769
After him!

31
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:23,773
After him!

32
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:29,678
Now!

33
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:49,231
<i> I am the one who runs from  both the
living and the dead,</i>

34
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:52,000
<i> hunted by scavengers,</i>

35
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:55,937
<i> haunted by those  I could not protect.</i>

36
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:08,016
<i> So I exist in this wasteland.</i>

37
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:17,191
<i> A man reduced  to a single instinct --</i>

38
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:19,126
<i> survive.</i>

39
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,173
Max?

40
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:41,307
Is that you?

41
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:43,309
Where were you?

42
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,913
Help us. Where were you?

43
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:48,448
Help us, Max. Where were you, Max?

44
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,716
Help us!

45
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:06,632
Help us, Max.

46
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:08,634
Stop running.

47
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:09,868
You let us die.

48
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:12,771
You let us die!

49
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:14,173
You let us die!

50
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:15,974
You promised to help us.

51
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:17,042
Why?

52
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:39,298
Witness!

53
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,183
We are war boys!

54
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:33,351
War boys! War boys! War boys! War boys!

55
00:06:33,353 --> 00:06:35,286
Kamakrazee war boys!

56
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:36,720
War boys! War boys! War boys! War boys!

57
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:40,123
Fucacima kamakrazee war boys!

58
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,225
Hooked on!

59
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:45,528
Today we're headin' to gas town!

60
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,430
Gas town! Gas town! Gas town! Gas town!

61
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:50,133
Today we're haulin' aqua cola.

62
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:51,635
Aqua cola! Aqua cola! Aqua cola! Aqua cola!

63
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:54,070
Today we're haulin' produce!

64
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:55,438
Produce! Produce! Produce! Produce!

65
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,908
And today we're haulin' mother's milk!

66
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,477
Mother's milk! Mother's milk!
Mother's milk! Mother's milk!

67
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:52,161
Rev it up for the immortan Joe!

68
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:03,105
Once again, we send off my war rig

69
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,608
to bring back guzzoline from gas town

70
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,545
and bullets from the bullet farm.

71
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:15,517
Once again, I salute my imperator, furiosa!

72
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,287
And I salute my half-life war boys

73
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:22,223
who will ride with me eternal

74
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:24,859
on the highways of Valhalla.

75
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,398
I am your redeemer!

76
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:39,140
It is by my hand you will rise
from the ashes of this world!

77
00:08:45,648 --> 00:08:48,082
It's comin'. G-get ready.

78
00:08:48,084 --> 00:08:52,420
Yes. Yes. Yes. It's comin'.

79
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:53,246
Do not, my friends,
become addicted to water.

80
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:55,215
It will take hold of you.

81
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:58,417
And you will resent its absence.

82
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,978
Clear off!

83
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,347
Get 'em all off!

84
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:30,049
Clear off!

85
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,661
Signal gas town. Convoy's on its way.

86
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:11,823
I got a war boy runnin' on empty.

87
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:14,025
Hook up that full-life.

88
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:20,665
Hey! Careful. That's a universal donor.

89
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:19,456
Boss, we're not going to gas town?

90
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,827
Bullet farm?

91
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:28,631
We're heading east.

92
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:31,801
I'll pass it down the line.

93
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:33,703
New orders!

94
00:12:33,705 --> 00:12:35,571
Thunder up! Thunder up!

95
00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:37,873
This is not a supply run!

96
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,243
Go. Go. Go. Ace, what's going on?

97
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:42,111
We're heading east. Why?

98
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:45,114
I don't know. That's the order.

99
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,099
Moo.

100
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:04,934
Hey, pa. Hm?

101
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:07,103
You know about this?

102
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:09,639
Your produce ain't going to gas town.

103
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:21,583
She's gone off-road...

104
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,952
Into hostile territory.

105
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:26,888
Why would she do that, dad?

106
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:29,824
Let me see. Let me see.

107
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:31,359
Rictus. I wanna see!

108
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:35,997
Rictus, go see what's agitating dad!

109
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,193
Splendid!

110
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:07,461
Angharad!

111
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:17,638
Where are they?

112
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,807
They are not your property.

113
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:20,974
Miss giddy?

114
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:23,043
You cannot own a human being.

115
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:26,513
Sooner or later someone pushes back!

116
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,816
Where is she taking them?!

117
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:31,819
She didn't take them. They begged her to go.

118
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:34,988
Where is she taking them?

119
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,890
A long way from you.

120
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:37,991
Aah!

121
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:04,117
Hey, what's happening?

122
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:08,121
Slit.

123
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:10,056
What's going on? Slit!

124
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:12,725
Treason, betrayal, an imperator gone rogue.

125
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:14,527
An imperator. Who?

126
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:15,895
Furiosa.

127
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:17,630
She took a lot of stuff from immortan Joe.

128
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:18,631
W-what stuff?

129
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:19,632
Breeders.

130
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:21,067
His prize breeders.

131
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:23,836
He wants them back. Not a hand laid on 'em.

132
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,013
By my deeds, I honor him. V-8.

133
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:41,654
Oh!

134
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:46,825
That's my wheel.

135
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:47,826
I'm driving.

136
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:49,094
You're my lancer.

137
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:50,929
I just promoted myself.

138
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:53,565
Not today. Today is my day. Look at you!

139
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:55,634
If you can't stand up, you can't do war!

140
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:56,902
He's right, son.

141
00:15:56,904 --> 00:15:58,603
I'm not staying here dying soft.

142
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:00,405
Ah, you're already a corpse.

143
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:03,642
I just need a top-up, some more juice.
There's no time!

144
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:05,510
We take my blood bag.

145
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:07,946
We take my blood bag and strap
him to the lancer's perch.

146
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:10,615
It's got a muzzle on it.
It's a raging feral. That's right.

147
00:16:10,617 --> 00:16:13,018
High-octane crazy blood fillin' me up.

148
00:16:15,956 --> 00:16:20,192
If I'm gonna die...

149
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:22,427
I'm gonna die historic on the fury road.

150
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,335
Yeah. Yeah.

151
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:31,837
Organic.

152
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,104
Yeah?

153
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:34,306
Hitch up his blood bag.

154
00:16:34,308 --> 00:16:35,774
Right-o.

155
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,548
Yeah!

156
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,384
Ah! How much more can they take from me?

157
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:50,221
They've got my blood. Now it's my car!

158
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:28,992
Immortan!

159
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:31,861
Immortan Joe!

160
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:34,230
Ah!

161
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:36,199
He looked at me!

162
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:37,834
He looked right at me!

163
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:39,769
He looked at your blood bag!

164
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:40,870
He turned his head.

165
00:17:40,872 --> 00:17:42,272
He looked me straight in the eye.

166
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:44,674
He was scanning the horizon.

167
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:46,376
No.

168
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:47,577
I am awaited.

169
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:50,313
I am awaited in Valhalla!

170
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,817
<i> Confucamus!</i>

171
00:17:57,088 --> 00:17:59,289
Immortan!

172
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,824
Yeah!

173
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:22,110
Hey! Heads up!

174
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:23,512
Heads up!

175
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:29,751
Boss!

176
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:31,420
We got vehicles from the citadel.

177
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:32,888
They're firing flares.

178
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,723
They want reinforcements

179
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:36,491
from gas town and the bullet farm.

180
00:18:36,493 --> 00:18:37,492
What is this?

181
00:18:37,494 --> 00:18:39,061
Backup? Decoy?

182
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:42,030
It's a detour.

183
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:15,162
Eyes right.

184
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:19,533
Buzzards!

185
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:20,601
Buzzards right!

186
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:21,702
Eyes on! Eyes on!

187
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:22,770
Buzzards right!

188
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:24,038
Eyes on!

189
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,539
yes on! Yeah!

190
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:30,544
Should we turn it 'round and
run 'em into our backup?

191
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:33,114
No. We're good.

192
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:35,316
We fang it!

193
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:42,490
Thunder up! Here we go!

194
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:45,726
Prepare the gunners!

195
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:15,588
Morsov!

196
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:21,661
Come on, attack!

197
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:36,242
War!

198
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,017
Ready!

199
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,762
She's ours, slit!

200
00:21:29,764 --> 00:21:30,996
She's ours.

201
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,098
First, we get the buzzards off her back!

202
00:21:38,138 --> 00:21:39,670
Form up!

203
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:45,476
That's my head!

204
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:54,585
Aah!

205
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,990
Aah! Aah!

206
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:23,214
Get up! You can do it!

207
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:29,052
Morsov!

208
00:22:29,054 --> 00:22:31,054
Morsov!

209
00:22:31,056 --> 00:22:32,055
No!

210
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:34,658
Witness me!

211
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,027
Witness! Witness!

212
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:47,737
Witness!

213
00:22:49,508 --> 00:22:52,309
Mediocre, morsov!

214
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:54,778
Mediocre! Aah!

215
00:23:13,565 --> 00:23:15,432
Ready!

216
00:23:25,243 --> 00:23:26,308
Get ready!

217
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:29,144
Back me in!

218
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:34,516
They're coming!

219
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:44,627
Ah!

220
00:23:51,035 --> 00:23:53,636
We can't breathe down there!

221
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:55,371
Stay out of sight!

222
00:23:56,274 --> 00:23:57,706
Now!

223
00:23:59,977 --> 00:24:01,110
Aah!

224
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:10,952
Go back!

225
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:14,722
Hydraulics! Hydraulics!

226
00:24:36,646 --> 00:24:39,113
Yeah.

227
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:45,486
Now we bring home the Booty.

228
00:24:49,993 --> 00:24:51,592
Aah!

229
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,947
She thinks she can lose us, dad.

230
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:15,983
She thinks we're stupid.

231
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:18,852
She thinks she can lose us in there!

232
00:25:36,972 --> 00:25:38,305
Fang it!

233
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:40,307
Fang it!

234
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:47,380
Why can't you stop?

235
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:49,215
Crew!

236
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:51,384
Outta the way! Out of the way!

237
00:25:51,386 --> 00:25:52,852
What have you done?

238
00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:54,220
What have you done?!

239
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,310
We need counterweight.
Get the blood bag down the back.

240
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:32,024
Hunt them down! Hunt them down!

241
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:56,014
Aah!

242
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,616
Hey, head...

243
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,085
Say bye-bye to the neck!

244
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:01,286
<i> Decapito!</i>

245
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:02,687
We're goin' in, slit!

246
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:07,618
Come on! We've almost got her!

247
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,793
Come on! Hold it steady!

248
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,286
Aah!

249
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,656
Oh, what a day!

250
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,591
What a lovely day!

251
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:10,045
I am the man...

252
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:11,413
Who grabs the sun...

253
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:17,519
...riding to Valhalla!

254
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:21,122
Witness me, blood bag!

255
00:29:24,294 --> 00:29:26,595
Witness!

256
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:52,287
I live, I die, I live again!

257
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:36,739
We're not going back.

258
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:06,236
Water.

259
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:52,114
Ahh.

260
00:34:58,755 --> 00:34:59,921
Ah.

261
00:35:01,357 --> 00:35:03,090
You.

262
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,808
Angharad, is that just the wind,

263
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,544
or is it a furious vexation?

264
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:54,566
I got it!

265
00:37:04,311 --> 00:37:05,978
Aah!

266
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:38,743
Glory me, blood bag! We snagged her alive.

267
00:37:38,745 --> 00:37:40,178
He's gonna shred her.

268
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,612
Shred her!

269
00:37:41,614 --> 00:37:43,381
Bolt cutters.

270
00:37:43,383 --> 00:37:46,084
Chain.

271
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:47,351
Hey, hey!

272
00:37:50,623 --> 00:37:52,623
Oh, look at them.

273
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,692
So shiny, so chrome.

274
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:57,195
He's gonna be so grateful.

275
00:37:57,197 --> 00:38:00,465
We could ask for anything.

276
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:02,467
I wanna drive the war rig.

277
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:04,535
What are you gonna ask for?

278
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:05,770
That's my jacket.

279
00:38:05,772 --> 00:38:07,271
Sure.

280
00:38:07,273 --> 00:38:09,974
I mean, you can ask for more than a jacket.

281
00:38:09,976 --> 00:38:11,609
We're going to the green place.

282
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:13,511
Wait, it's you and me.

283
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:29,559
We're going to the green
place of many mothers.

284
00:38:47,613 --> 00:38:49,312
How does it feel?

285
00:38:49,314 --> 00:38:50,480
It hurts.

286
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:53,183
Out here, everything hurts.

287
00:38:53,185 --> 00:38:56,753
You wanna get through this?

288
00:38:58,757 --> 00:39:01,491
Do as I say.

289
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:08,731
Now pick up what you can and run.

290
00:39:50,241 --> 00:39:52,775
Kill switches.

291
00:39:54,178 --> 00:39:55,878
I set the sequence myself.

292
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,079
This rig goes nowhere without me.

293
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:03,685
You can get in.

294
00:40:03,687 --> 00:40:05,987
Not without them.

295
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:16,931
So we wait.

296
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,941
You're relying on the
gratitude of a very bad man.

297
00:40:26,943 --> 00:40:28,509
You've already damaged one of his wives.

298
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:30,144
How grateful do you think he's gonna be?

299
00:40:36,753 --> 00:40:38,720
You're sitting on 2,000 horsepower

300
00:40:38,722 --> 00:40:40,421
of nitro-boosted war machine.

301
00:40:40,423 --> 00:40:44,626
I'd say you've got about
a five-minute head start.

302
00:40:49,598 --> 00:40:53,600
You want that thing off your face?

303
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:07,481
Let's go.

304
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,463
Uh-uh-uh.

305
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:52,758
Of all the legs you had to shoot,

306
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,528
that one was attached to his favorite.

307
00:42:15,817 --> 00:42:17,216
Smeg!

308
00:42:36,703 --> 00:42:38,737
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.

309
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:40,038
What choice does she have?

310
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,806
He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.

311
00:42:41,808 --> 00:42:42,974
Why? To bargain.

312
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:44,976
Oh, he'll hurt us, all right.

313
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:47,545
Do you think he's
coming to the green place? Never!

314
00:42:47,547 --> 00:42:49,381
He's a crazy smeg who eats<i> schlanger!</i>

315
00:43:15,942 --> 00:43:17,208
Ah, stay out of there.

316
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,509
Behind you.

317
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:20,310
Huh?

318
00:43:23,082 --> 00:43:24,782
The gas town boys.

319
00:43:25,918 --> 00:43:28,786
don't damage the good.

320
00:43:32,591 --> 00:43:36,427
What do you see?

321
00:43:38,064 --> 00:43:41,231
Big rigs.

322
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:43,600
Polecats.

323
00:43:43,602 --> 00:43:46,036
Flamers.

324
00:43:46,038 --> 00:43:49,406
And there's the people eater himself.

325
00:43:49,408 --> 00:43:52,609
Coming to count the cost.

326
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:53,811
Hm.

327
00:44:04,256 --> 00:44:05,989
Aah!

328
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,626
We're dragging something out back.

329
00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:12,395
I think it's the fuel pod.

330
00:44:12,397 --> 00:44:14,097
No, no.

331
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,332
I'll go.

332
00:45:40,184 --> 00:45:42,083
Filth! You traited him!

333
00:45:46,323 --> 00:45:47,722
No unnecessary killing!

334
00:45:47,724 --> 00:45:49,190
This war boy wants me dead!

335
00:45:49,192 --> 00:45:50,191
We agreed!

336
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:52,726
He's kamakrazee!

337
00:45:52,728 --> 00:45:55,229
He's just a kid at the end of his half-life.

338
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:58,098
No! I live, I die, I live again!

339
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,366
Hold him! Tie him up!

340
00:45:59,368 --> 00:46:00,901
Get off him. Throw him out!

341
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:02,503
Chuck him out.

342
00:46:03,506 --> 00:46:05,372
You got more friends.

343
00:46:07,009 --> 00:46:09,176
Bullet farmer.

344
00:46:09,178 --> 00:46:11,445
They're coming from the bullet farm. Yeah?

345
00:46:11,447 --> 00:46:13,681
It's over. You can't defy him.

346
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:15,883
Just watch us, mate.

347
00:46:15,885 --> 00:46:17,384
He is the one who grabbed the sun.

348
00:46:17,386 --> 00:46:19,119
Look at how slick
he's fooled you, war boy!

349
00:46:19,121 --> 00:46:20,921
He's a lying old man.

350
00:46:20,923 --> 00:46:22,389
By his hand, we'll be lifted up!

351
00:46:22,391 --> 00:46:24,792
That's why we have his
logo seared on our backs!

352
00:46:24,794 --> 00:46:26,694
"Breeding stock!" "Battle fodder!"

353
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:30,397
No, I am awaited!
You're an old man's battle fodder!

354
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,466
Killing everyone and everything!
We're not to blame!

355
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:34,635
Then who killed the world?

356
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:04,130
I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage.

357
00:47:04,132 --> 00:47:07,300
I don't know if it's still any good.

358
00:47:07,302 --> 00:47:08,635
Get back in the hold!

359
00:47:08,637 --> 00:47:11,971
Keep the hatch open.

360
00:47:17,279 --> 00:47:18,678
I need you here.

361
00:47:19,948 --> 00:47:22,515
You may have to drive the rig.

362
00:47:27,322 --> 00:47:28,720
You.

363
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,156
You stay.

364
00:47:31,158 --> 00:47:34,926
You stay there.

365
00:47:36,797 --> 00:47:39,464
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

366
00:47:39,466 --> 00:47:43,268
I'm supposed to be alone. That was the deal.

367
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,209
Down here.

368
00:48:10,497 --> 00:48:12,731
Hey.

369
00:48:12,733 --> 00:48:15,033
What's your name?

370
00:48:15,035 --> 00:48:17,903
What do I call you?

371
00:48:17,905 --> 00:48:20,504
Does it matter?

372
00:48:22,642 --> 00:48:23,708
Fine.

373
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,643
When I yell "fool,"

374
00:48:25,645 --> 00:48:28,145
you drive out of here as fast as you can.

375
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:31,916
This is the sequence -- one.

376
00:48:31,918 --> 00:48:33,751
One, two.

377
00:48:33,753 --> 00:48:35,553
One.

378
00:48:35,555 --> 00:48:38,089
Red, black, go.

379
00:48:38,091 --> 00:48:40,224
You have it?

380
00:50:05,309 --> 00:50:07,309
It's all here!

381
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:09,778
Three thousand gallons of guzzoline,

382
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,246
just like you asked!

383
00:50:14,785 --> 00:50:16,985
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

384
00:50:16,987 --> 00:50:21,790
You drop the rocks.

385
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:32,100
You said,
"a few vehicles in pursuit.

386
00:50:32,102 --> 00:50:34,002
Maybe."

387
00:50:34,004 --> 00:50:36,872
We count three war parties!

388
00:50:36,874 --> 00:50:39,475
Yeah, well, I got unlucky.

389
00:50:39,477 --> 00:50:41,009
Let's do this!

390
00:51:06,135 --> 00:51:08,703
Fool!

391
00:51:49,278 --> 00:51:50,944
That's our fuel!

392
00:52:05,627 --> 00:52:08,295
Make way for the ripsaw!

393
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:25,612
Once I'm over, clear the rocks

394
00:52:25,614 --> 00:52:27,714
and bring everyone through.

395
00:52:27,716 --> 00:52:30,049
Immortan! Immortan Joe!

396
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:33,285
I got a war boy! Says he was on the war rig!

397
00:52:35,256 --> 00:52:37,823
You! Climb aboard!

398
00:52:39,727 --> 00:52:41,293
Hey! Hey!

399
00:52:41,295 --> 00:52:43,562
I got his boot!

400
00:52:43,564 --> 00:52:46,599
I got the blood bag's boot!

401
00:52:46,601 --> 00:52:47,666
Take me!

402
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:50,169
I got his boot!

403
00:52:50,171 --> 00:52:54,139
All this for a family squabble.

404
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:57,242
Healthy babies.

405
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:05,901
Reload the clip.

406
00:55:05,903 --> 00:55:07,470
I-I can't.

407
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:17,046
Gun!

408
00:55:17,048 --> 00:55:18,714
Give the gun! It's not loaded yet!

409
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:19,648
You! Now!

410
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,850
We had a deal!

411
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:02,423
Aah!

412
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:08,930
Aah!

413
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:11,032
Rictus!

414
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,433
The wives!

415
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,935
No more flames.

416
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:21,976
Splendid!

417
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,545
Splendid!

418
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:24,712
That's my child!

419
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,348
My property!

420
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,251
Immorta--

421
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:43,897
immortan, if I get on the rig,
there's a way inside.

422
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:45,699
What is your name? It's nux.

423
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:48,735
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing for ya.

424
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:50,037
No.

425
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:52,973
Put a bullet in her skull, stop the rig,

426
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:54,808
return my treasures to me,

427
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:57,511
and I myself will carry you

428
00:56:57,513 --> 00:57:00,914
to the gates of Valhalla.

429
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:02,382
Am I awaited?

430
00:57:02,384 --> 00:57:08,488
You will ride eternal -- shiny and chrome.

431
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:09,923
Rictus!

432
00:57:09,925 --> 00:57:12,726
Help him aboard!

433
00:57:12,728 --> 00:57:14,328
Ready?

434
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,563
Here we go!

435
00:57:27,176 --> 00:57:31,077
Mediocre!

436
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:01,340
<i> Schlanger!</i>

437
00:58:05,713 --> 00:58:07,113
Aah!

438
00:58:21,128 --> 00:58:23,061
Look out!

439
00:58:25,899 --> 00:58:27,599
Angharad!

440
00:58:27,601 --> 00:58:29,701
Get out!

441
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:52,257
No! Angharad!

442
00:59:06,473 --> 00:59:09,373
Stop! Turn the rig around!

443
00:59:10,109 --> 00:59:11,442
Go back for her!

444
00:59:11,444 --> 00:59:13,110
No.

445
00:59:13,112 --> 00:59:15,512
Tell him to turn the rig around!

446
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:17,014
Did you see it?

447
00:59:17,016 --> 00:59:19,483
She went under the wheels.

448
00:59:19,485 --> 00:59:22,119
Did you see it?

449
00:59:22,121 --> 00:59:24,521
She went under the wheels.

450
00:59:25,524 --> 00:59:26,557
We keep moving.

451
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:27,992
No! We keep moving!

452
00:59:27,994 --> 00:59:30,527
He doesn't know what he's talking about!

453
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:32,896
Whatever happens,
we're going to the green place.

454
00:59:32,898 --> 00:59:34,164
The stupid green place.

455
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:35,899
We don't even know where to find it.

456
00:59:47,747 --> 00:59:49,179
You all right?

457
00:59:49,181 --> 00:59:51,749
On! On!

458
01:00:28,787 --> 01:00:30,286
Cheedo!

459
01:00:30,288 --> 01:00:32,221
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

460
01:00:32,223 --> 01:00:34,857
Stop! He'll forgive us. I know he will.

461
01:00:34,859 --> 01:00:36,459
There is no going back!

462
01:00:36,461 --> 01:00:38,294
We were his treasures!

463
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:39,929
Cheedo! We were protected.

464
01:00:39,931 --> 01:00:41,531
He gave us the high life.

465
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:43,466
What wrong with that? We are not things.

466
01:00:44,536 --> 01:00:45,468
No!

467
01:00:46,604 --> 01:00:48,204
Cheedo, we are not things!

468
01:00:48,206 --> 01:00:49,438
We are not things.

469
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,406
I don't want to hear that again!

470
01:00:51,408 --> 01:00:52,607
They were her words!

471
01:00:52,609 --> 01:00:55,043
And now she's dead!

472
01:00:55,045 --> 01:00:56,611
Wring your hands.

473
01:00:58,215 --> 01:01:00,549
You're not going back to him.

474
01:01:00,551 --> 01:01:01,550
Angharad!

475
01:01:01,552 --> 01:01:03,318
Come on! Come on!

476
01:01:19,002 --> 01:01:21,670
So, um...

477
01:01:23,607 --> 01:01:26,575
Where is this...

478
01:01:26,577 --> 01:01:29,077
This green place?

479
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:31,680
It's a long night's run, heading east.

480
01:01:31,682 --> 01:01:33,315
Hm.

481
01:01:33,317 --> 01:01:34,816
We need inventory.

482
01:01:34,818 --> 01:01:38,019
I want you to match every
gun with its bullets.

483
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:43,657
I'm gonna go down and do some repairs.

484
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,292
We need someone down the back.

485
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:47,261
I'll go. No.

486
01:01:47,263 --> 01:01:49,497
I want you to stay together.

487
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:51,532
I can do it.

488
01:02:23,799 --> 01:02:25,399
What are you doing here?

489
01:02:25,401 --> 01:02:30,136
He saw it. He saw it all.

490
01:02:30,138 --> 01:02:34,040
My own blood bag drivin'
the rig that killed her.

491
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,982
Stop doing that.

492
01:02:44,152 --> 01:02:46,386
Shh, shh, shh.

493
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:47,654
Stop.

494
01:02:57,666 --> 01:03:00,600
Thr-- three times the gates were open to me.

495
01:03:00,602 --> 01:03:01,868
What gates?

496
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:03,603
I was awaited in Valhalla.

497
01:03:03,605 --> 01:03:05,371
They were calling my name.

498
01:03:05,373 --> 01:03:07,941
I should be walking with the immorta,

499
01:03:07,943 --> 01:03:10,777
mcfeasting with the heroes of all time.

500
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:17,750
I'd say it was your manifest Destiny not to.

501
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:22,087
I thought I was being
spared for something great.

502
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:25,257
I got to drive a pursuit vehicle.

503
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:29,695
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.

504
01:03:29,697 --> 01:03:31,430
Who are Larry and Barry?

505
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,198
My mates.

506
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,767
Larry and Barry.

507
01:03:35,769 --> 01:03:41,039
If they don't get me,
then the night fevers will.

508
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:06,665
Well, we've only got four for big boy here,

509
01:04:06,667 --> 01:04:08,300
so he's all but useless.

510
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:13,170
But we can squirt off this little pinky

511
01:04:13,172 --> 01:04:16,240
a raunchy 29 times.

512
01:04:16,242 --> 01:04:19,644
Angharad used to call them antiseed.

513
01:04:19,646 --> 01:04:24,482
Plant one and watch something die.

514
01:05:56,607 --> 01:06:01,276
We are down 30,000 units of guzzoline,

515
01:06:01,278 --> 01:06:05,013
19 canisters of nitro, 12 assault bikes,

516
01:06:05,015 --> 01:06:06,749
7 pursuit vehicles.

517
01:06:06,751 --> 01:06:08,283
The deficit mounts.

518
01:06:08,285 --> 01:06:12,855
And now, sir, you have
us stuck in a quagmire.

519
01:06:12,857 --> 01:06:14,790
Hey, Joe!

520
01:06:14,792 --> 01:06:16,859
Boss!

521
01:06:16,861 --> 01:06:20,529
Your girly's breathing her last!

522
01:06:20,531 --> 01:06:22,931
What about the child?

523
01:06:31,642 --> 01:06:33,609
Are ya comin', brother?

524
01:06:33,611 --> 01:06:34,877
Wait!

525
01:06:36,113 --> 01:06:38,247
It's gone awful quiet in there.

526
01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:39,647
Get it out.

527
01:06:39,649 --> 01:06:41,182
Get it out!

528
01:06:43,787 --> 01:06:46,053
Come on! I've been called to the torture!

529
01:06:46,055 --> 01:06:47,789
Patience!

530
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:52,126
Oh, you stay here with your grief, daddy.

531
01:06:52,128 --> 01:06:53,461
I'll fetch 'em for ya.

532
01:06:53,463 --> 01:06:55,530
Be careful! Protect the assets!

533
01:06:57,634 --> 01:07:00,902
Just one angry shot...

534
01:07:00,904 --> 01:07:02,570
For furiosa.

535
01:07:02,572 --> 01:07:03,638
Hut!

536
01:07:10,647 --> 01:07:13,748
Cryin' shame.

537
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:14,916
Come.

538
01:07:14,918 --> 01:07:17,251
Nother month...

539
01:07:17,253 --> 01:07:20,288
Could've been your viable human.

540
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:21,689
Was it a male?

541
01:07:21,691 --> 01:07:23,491
Your a-one Alpha prime.

542
01:07:24,994 --> 01:07:27,128
Hey, rictus!

543
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,362
Huh?

544
01:07:28,364 --> 01:07:30,664
You lost a baby brother.

545
01:07:32,868 --> 01:07:36,770
Perfect in every way.

546
01:07:36,772 --> 01:07:38,972
I had a baby brother!

547
01:07:38,974 --> 01:07:41,775
I had a little baby brother!

548
01:07:41,777 --> 01:07:43,810
And he was perfect!

549
01:07:43,812 --> 01:07:46,112
Perfect in every way!

550
01:08:16,512 --> 01:08:18,078
Come on.

551
01:08:26,988 --> 01:08:29,522
Wouldn't wanna shoot the wives, sir.

552
01:08:29,524 --> 01:08:30,556
Just probing.

553
01:08:41,669 --> 01:08:43,369
He wants to help!

554
01:08:43,371 --> 01:08:44,403
Who?!

555
01:08:44,405 --> 01:08:46,038
The war boy!

556
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,740
Where did he come from?!

557
01:08:47,742 --> 01:08:50,342
I thought we threw him off the rig!

558
01:08:53,281 --> 01:08:55,848
T-there's high ground
just beyond that thing.

559
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:56,849
He means the tree.

560
01:08:56,851 --> 01:08:59,285
Yeah. Tree!

561
01:08:59,287 --> 01:09:00,619
Leave him to me.

562
01:09:00,621 --> 01:09:02,788
Say, anyone notice that bright light?

563
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:04,957
Encroaching gunfire?

564
01:09:04,959 --> 01:09:07,593
Get out. I-I can do this.
I know this machine.

565
01:09:07,595 --> 01:09:09,361
He does. He's a revhead.

566
01:09:14,401 --> 01:09:15,967
You've got two left.

567
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,207
On him.

568
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,727
don't breathe.

569
01:09:43,296 --> 01:09:44,996
Aah!

570
01:09:45,732 --> 01:09:47,298
Hey!

571
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:50,134
Hey! Hey! War boy!

572
01:09:50,136 --> 01:09:52,937
I'm gonna use the winch
'round the tree thing!

573
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:57,075
Take this. Let's get the engine plates.

574
01:09:57,077 --> 01:09:59,243
You drive the rig!

575
01:09:59,245 --> 01:10:01,244
Hold up a flare. I am holding a flare!

576
01:10:01,246 --> 01:10:02,446
Closer.

577
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:05,182
It's right in front of your eyes!

578
01:10:16,662 --> 01:10:18,228
Hut! Hut!!

579
01:10:24,503 --> 01:10:26,069
Blood bag!

580
01:10:32,378 --> 01:10:34,878
I am the scales of justice!

581
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,748
Conductor of the choir of death!

582
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:43,887
Sing, brother koch!

583
01:10:46,692 --> 01:10:48,959
Sing, brothers, sing!

584
01:10:48,961 --> 01:10:50,359
Sing!

585
01:10:50,361 --> 01:10:52,561
don't they know they're shooting at us?

586
01:11:07,412 --> 01:11:11,047
Gun fever!

587
01:12:18,648 --> 01:12:21,316
I never thought I'd do
something as shine as that.

588
01:12:21,318 --> 01:12:23,551
How are the engines?

589
01:12:23,553 --> 01:12:25,453
Very hot and real thirsty.

590
01:12:29,559 --> 01:12:31,125
Hey.

591
01:12:31,127 --> 01:12:34,495
You need to take the war rig
half a click down the track.

592
01:12:34,497 --> 01:12:35,896
What if you're not back

593
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:38,232
by the time the engines have cooled?

594
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:42,136
Well, you keep moving.

595
01:12:51,247 --> 01:12:53,647
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

596
01:12:53,649 --> 01:12:56,517
Retaliate first.

597
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:00,654
Let's go!

598
01:13:40,628 --> 01:13:43,763
Oh.

599
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:22,000
Are you hurt?

600
01:14:22,002 --> 01:14:23,235
Huh?

601
01:14:23,237 --> 01:14:24,669
You're bleeding.

602
01:14:24,671 --> 01:14:26,872
That's not his blood.

603
01:14:28,175 --> 01:14:30,742
What is this?

604
01:14:30,744 --> 01:14:32,143
It's mother's milk.

605
01:15:13,452 --> 01:15:15,753
It's okay.

606
01:15:15,755 --> 01:15:17,054
Sleep.

607
01:15:17,056 --> 01:15:19,490
Get some rest.

608
01:15:29,268 --> 01:15:33,470
How do you know this place even exists?

609
01:15:35,308 --> 01:15:37,007
I was born there.

610
01:15:38,844 --> 01:15:40,311
So why'd you leave?

611
01:15:40,313 --> 01:15:42,613
I didn't.

612
01:15:42,615 --> 01:15:45,482
I was taken as a child.

613
01:15:46,786 --> 01:15:48,719
Stolen.

614
01:15:54,025 --> 01:15:56,592
You done this before?

615
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:58,127
Many times.

616
01:15:58,129 --> 01:16:01,998
Now that I drive a war rig...

617
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,134
This is the best shot I'll ever have.

618
01:16:05,136 --> 01:16:07,437
And them?

619
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:11,307
They're looking for hope.

620
01:16:11,309 --> 01:16:13,576
What about you?

621
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:19,916
Redemption.

622
01:17:02,893 --> 01:17:05,961
Hey, what's that?

623
01:17:18,108 --> 01:17:21,977
I remember something like that.

624
01:17:32,889 --> 01:17:35,389
Help me!

625
01:17:37,393 --> 01:17:41,462
Help me!

626
01:17:41,464 --> 01:17:44,031
Help me, please! Uh-oh.

627
01:17:44,033 --> 01:17:45,399
Please!

628
01:17:45,401 --> 01:17:47,301
That's bait.

629
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:50,171
Stay in the rig.

630
01:17:54,444 --> 01:17:59,547
Hurry! Please, hurry! They'll be back!

631
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:02,983
I am one of the vuvalini!

632
01:18:02,985 --> 01:18:05,553
Of the many mothers!

633
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:09,657
My initiate mother was k.T. Concannon!

634
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:13,461
I am the daughter of Mary jabassa.

635
01:18:13,463 --> 01:18:18,399
My clan was swaddle dog!

636
01:19:03,211 --> 01:19:06,045
It's me.

637
01:19:13,354 --> 01:19:15,787
There's something in the eyes.

638
01:19:15,789 --> 01:19:18,857
Perhaps it is jabassa's child.

639
01:19:23,397 --> 01:19:25,430
This is our furiosa.

640
01:19:27,568 --> 01:19:29,334
How long has it been?

641
01:19:29,336 --> 01:19:32,337
7,000 days.

642
01:19:32,339 --> 01:19:36,175
Plus the ones I don't remember.

643
01:19:36,177 --> 01:19:37,543
Furiosa.

644
01:19:38,812 --> 01:19:40,579
What happened to your mother?

645
01:19:40,581 --> 01:19:43,982
She died.

646
01:19:43,984 --> 01:19:45,751
On the third day.

647
01:19:52,893 --> 01:19:54,092
From where did you come?

648
01:19:54,094 --> 01:19:56,061
The west. Citadel.

649
01:19:56,063 --> 01:19:58,397
Beyond the mountains.

650
01:20:01,334 --> 01:20:04,235
The men -- who are they?

651
01:20:04,237 --> 01:20:06,170
They're reliable.

652
01:20:06,172 --> 01:20:08,339
They helped us get here.

653
01:20:18,918 --> 01:20:20,218
Oh.

654
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:24,422
Where did you find such creatures?

655
01:20:24,424 --> 01:20:26,591
So soft.

656
01:20:26,593 --> 01:20:31,095
This one has all her teeth.

657
01:20:33,466 --> 01:20:34,632
Oh!

658
01:20:36,402 --> 01:20:39,737
I can't wait for them to see it.

659
01:20:39,739 --> 01:20:42,306
See?

660
01:20:42,308 --> 01:20:43,908
See what?

661
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:45,176
Home.

662
01:20:48,915 --> 01:20:50,981
The green place.

663
01:20:50,983 --> 01:20:56,286
But if you came from the west,
you passed it.

664
01:20:56,288 --> 01:20:57,621
The crows.

665
01:20:57,623 --> 01:21:01,591
The creepy place with all the crows.

666
01:21:01,593 --> 01:21:02,826
The soil.

667
01:21:02,828 --> 01:21:04,227
We had to get out.

668
01:21:04,229 --> 01:21:06,096
We had no water and -- the water was filth.

669
01:21:06,098 --> 01:21:07,731
It was poisoned. It was sour.

670
01:21:07,733 --> 01:21:09,432
And the crows came.

671
01:21:09,434 --> 01:21:11,468
We couldn't grow anything.

672
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:13,003
Where are the others?

673
01:21:13,005 --> 01:21:14,437
What others?

674
01:21:14,439 --> 01:21:15,805
The many mothers.

675
01:21:15,807 --> 01:21:17,841
We're the only ones left.

676
01:22:17,068 --> 01:22:20,569
Look.

677
01:22:20,571 --> 01:22:24,139
That's what you call a satellite.

678
01:22:24,141 --> 01:22:27,309
Miss giddy told us about those.

679
01:22:27,311 --> 01:22:31,346
They used to bounce
messages across the earth.

680
01:22:31,348 --> 01:22:32,647
Shows.

681
01:22:32,649 --> 01:22:35,550
Everyone in the old world had a show.

682
01:22:35,552 --> 01:22:40,888
Do you think there's
still somebody out there?

683
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:42,924
Sending shows?

684
01:22:42,926 --> 01:22:44,559
Who knows?

685
01:22:44,561 --> 01:22:48,996
Those are the plains of silence.

686
01:22:48,998 --> 01:22:52,367
Stay right where you are, little Joe.

687
01:22:52,369 --> 01:22:55,536
Kind of lost its novelty out here.

688
01:22:55,538 --> 01:22:57,238
You having a baby?

689
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,773
Warlord Jr.

690
01:22:58,775 --> 01:23:00,942
Gonna be so ugly.

691
01:23:00,944 --> 01:23:03,010
It could be a girl.

692
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:06,447
You kill people with that, do ya?

693
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:08,549
Killed everyone I ever met out here.

694
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:09,751
Headshots, all of 'em.

695
01:23:09,753 --> 01:23:11,419
Snap. Right in the medulla.

696
01:23:11,421 --> 01:23:13,621
Thought somehow you girls
were above all that.

697
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:19,360
Come here.

698
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:28,101
Take a peek.

699
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:31,238
Seeds.

700
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,906
These are from home.

701
01:23:32,908 --> 01:23:35,275
Heirlooms. The real thing.

702
01:23:35,277 --> 01:23:37,611
I plant one every chance I get.

703
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:38,979
Where?

704
01:23:38,981 --> 01:23:42,082
So far, nothing's took. Earth's too sour.

705
01:23:42,084 --> 01:23:44,384
Ah, so many different kinds.

706
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:46,720
Trees, flowers, fruit.

707
01:23:46,722 --> 01:23:49,790
Back then, everyone had their fill.

708
01:23:49,792 --> 01:23:52,726
Back then, there was no
need to snap anybody.

709
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:09,209
Can I talk to you?

710
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,197
I've talked with the others.

711
01:24:37,538 --> 01:24:39,705
We're never gonna have a better chance

712
01:24:39,707 --> 01:24:42,475
to make it across the salt.

713
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:44,477
If we leave the rig here

714
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,780
and load the motorcycles
up with as much as we can,

715
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:51,317
we can maybe ride for 160 days.

716
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:56,021
One of those bikes is yours.

717
01:24:56,023 --> 01:24:58,858
Fully loaded.

718
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:03,528
You're more than welcome to come with us.

719
01:25:06,366 --> 01:25:08,933
I'll -- I'll make my own way.

720
01:25:14,908 --> 01:25:17,542
You know, hope is a mistake.

721
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:26,918
If you can't fix what's broken,
you'll, uh...

722
01:25:29,256 --> 01:25:30,955
...you'll go insane.

723
01:25:46,606 --> 01:25:49,173
<i> Where are you, Max?</i>

724
01:25:50,776 --> 01:25:52,509
<i> Where are you?</i>

725
01:25:52,511 --> 01:25:53,744
<i> Help me.</i>

726
01:25:53,746 --> 01:25:56,680
<i> Help us.  You promised to help us.</i>

727
01:26:06,258 --> 01:26:09,092
<i> Come on, pa.  Let's go.</i>

728
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:42,825
All right.

729
01:26:42,827 --> 01:26:46,128
This is your way home.

730
01:26:48,099 --> 01:26:49,665
We go back?

731
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:51,667
Mm.

732
01:26:51,669 --> 01:26:52,969
Back? Yeah.

733
01:26:52,971 --> 01:26:55,638
I thought you weren't insane anymore.

734
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,239
What are they saying?

735
01:26:57,241 --> 01:26:59,942
He wants to go back from where they came.

736
01:26:59,944 --> 01:27:01,277
The citadel.

737
01:27:01,279 --> 01:27:03,446
And what's there to find at the citadel?

738
01:27:03,448 --> 01:27:04,647
Green.

739
01:27:04,649 --> 01:27:07,016
And water.

740
01:27:07,018 --> 01:27:10,252
There's a ridiculous amount of clear water.

741
01:27:10,254 --> 01:27:12,188
And a lot of crops.

742
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:14,857
It's got everything you need,
as long as you're not afraid of heights.

743
01:27:14,859 --> 01:27:16,258
Where does the water come from?

744
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:17,994
He pumps it up from deep in the earth.

745
01:27:17,996 --> 01:27:20,129
Calls it aqua cola and
claims it all for himself.

746
01:27:20,131 --> 01:27:22,665
And because he owns it, he owns all of us.

747
01:27:22,667 --> 01:27:24,300
I don't like him already.

748
01:27:24,302 --> 01:27:26,369
It'll take two weeks to
skirt the wall of mountains.

749
01:27:26,371 --> 01:27:27,837
No.

750
01:27:27,839 --> 01:27:31,940
I suggest we go back the same way we came.

751
01:27:31,942 --> 01:27:33,642
Through the canyon.

752
01:27:33,644 --> 01:27:36,478
It's open. We know that. Right?

753
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,813
He brought all his war parties through.

754
01:27:38,815 --> 01:27:40,849
So we take the war rig and we charge it

755
01:27:40,851 --> 01:27:42,884
right through the middle of them.

756
01:27:42,886 --> 01:27:45,720
We can decouple the tanker at the pass.

757
01:27:45,722 --> 01:27:47,355
Shut it off behind us.

758
01:27:47,357 --> 01:27:48,723
Kaboom!

759
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:53,395
And how exactly do we take the citadel?

760
01:27:53,397 --> 01:27:56,398
Assuming we're still alive by then?

761
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,334
If we can block the pass, it'll be easy.

762
01:27:59,336 --> 01:28:01,336
All that's left are his war pups

763
01:28:01,338 --> 01:28:03,238
and war boys too sick to fight.

764
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,074
And we'll be with nux.
He's a war boy.

765
01:28:06,076 --> 01:28:07,676
He'll be bringing us home,

766
01:28:07,678 --> 01:28:10,478
bringing back what's stolen,
as he's meant to.

767
01:28:12,883 --> 01:28:15,150
Yeah.

768
01:28:15,152 --> 01:28:18,186
It feels like hope.

769
01:28:18,188 --> 01:28:20,722
I like this plan.

770
01:28:20,724 --> 01:28:22,589
We can start again.

771
01:28:22,591 --> 01:28:25,526
Just like the old days.

772
01:28:25,528 --> 01:28:29,830
Look, it'll be a hard day.

773
01:28:29,832 --> 01:28:33,033
But I guarantee you that
160 days ridin' that way,

774
01:28:33,035 --> 01:28:37,438
there's nothin' but salt.

775
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:43,544
At least that way, you know,
we might be able to...

776
01:28:43,546 --> 01:28:46,680
Together...

777
01:28:46,682 --> 01:28:49,183
Come across some kind of redemption.

778
01:29:18,313 --> 01:29:20,780
War rig!

779
01:29:20,782 --> 01:29:23,549
That's the war rig!

780
01:29:33,328 --> 01:29:34,427
That's them.

781
01:29:34,429 --> 01:29:36,229
Why are they going back?

782
01:29:36,231 --> 01:29:38,164
Do they wish to surrender?

783
01:29:38,166 --> 01:29:40,533
They are heading for the canyon.

784
01:29:42,237 --> 01:29:45,071
They're going back to the citadel!

785
01:29:45,073 --> 01:29:47,340
They know it's undefended!

786
01:29:47,342 --> 01:29:48,608
Bullocks!

787
01:29:50,779 --> 01:29:52,845
Roll up! Roll up!

788
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:02,821
Go!

789
01:30:24,711 --> 01:30:26,611
What are you doing? Praying.

790
01:30:26,613 --> 01:30:29,681
To who? Anyone that's listening.

791
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:54,872
Here we go, girls!

792
01:30:57,343 --> 01:30:59,310
That's mine!

793
01:31:02,982 --> 01:31:05,950
He'll try to get in front of us,
spike our wheels.

794
01:31:11,858 --> 01:31:13,424
don't blow my engine.

795
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:14,992
I'm gonna nudge him.

796
01:31:14,994 --> 01:31:16,260
Just a little.

797
01:31:28,674 --> 01:31:32,276
You filth! You traitored him!

798
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,066
Go.

799
01:32:21,793 --> 01:32:24,127
Got to back off.

800
01:32:24,129 --> 01:32:27,430
Engine one is gone. two's about to blow.

801
01:32:27,432 --> 01:32:28,431
Right.

802
01:32:28,433 --> 01:32:30,333
Are you a black thumb?

803
01:32:30,335 --> 01:32:31,633
Uh-huh.

804
01:32:31,635 --> 01:32:33,168
All right. Engine one now.

805
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:34,603
You and me, fifth wheel.

806
01:32:34,605 --> 01:32:36,171
We'll unhook the tanker.

807
01:32:48,752 --> 01:32:52,354
One man, one bullet.

808
01:33:07,504 --> 01:33:08,537
I cannot see.

809
01:33:08,539 --> 01:33:09,604
Maadi! Maadi!

810
01:33:09,606 --> 01:33:10,939
I cannot see.

811
01:33:30,626 --> 01:33:31,625
Oh!

812
01:33:49,379 --> 01:33:51,145
Hey!

813
01:33:51,147 --> 01:33:52,880
Harpoons and plows!

814
01:33:52,882 --> 01:33:54,548
They're hauling us back!

815
01:34:05,061 --> 01:34:08,829
Leave three bolts. Three.

816
01:34:36,124 --> 01:34:37,524
Aah!

817
01:34:45,133 --> 01:34:47,033
Aah!

818
01:35:25,673 --> 01:35:26,872
Hey, you!

819
01:35:42,456 --> 01:35:44,623
Are you okay?

820
01:35:46,627 --> 01:35:49,928
I think she's hurt.

821
01:36:12,118 --> 01:36:13,451
Hey!

822
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:41,411
No!

823
01:36:49,154 --> 01:36:52,022
<i> Hey.</i>

824
01:36:52,024 --> 01:36:53,323
<i> Stay with me.</i>

825
01:36:53,325 --> 01:36:55,492
<i> Stay with me.</i> Stay with me.

826
01:36:55,494 --> 01:36:57,093
Hey. Are you there?

827
01:36:58,764 --> 01:37:00,964
You finish that! I'll finish her!

828
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:32,553
Valhalla!

829
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:45,166
Oi!

830
01:38:46,202 --> 01:38:48,036
Aah!

831
01:39:11,994 --> 01:39:13,360
Engine one's good.

832
01:39:13,362 --> 01:39:15,195
For now.

833
01:39:24,406 --> 01:39:26,006
Aah!

834
01:40:03,678 --> 01:40:06,679
She's hurt! She's hurt real bad!

835
01:41:36,169 --> 01:41:37,602
You hear that?

836
01:41:37,604 --> 01:41:40,171
We're gonna see two airborne v-8s.

837
01:41:40,173 --> 01:41:43,707
I'm gonna need you to drive.

838
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:47,778
I'll get him out of our way.

839
01:42:54,279 --> 01:42:57,513
Rictus! Take me!

840
01:43:10,895 --> 01:43:11,961
Cheedo!

841
01:43:11,963 --> 01:43:14,463
What are you doing?

842
01:43:17,869 --> 01:43:19,201
Aah! No!

843
01:43:23,874 --> 01:43:25,407
Big boy!

844
01:43:25,409 --> 01:43:27,008
Aah!

845
01:43:31,548 --> 01:43:33,548
Here! Here!

846
01:43:51,668 --> 01:43:52,934
Hey!

847
01:44:25,301 --> 01:44:27,201
No!

848
01:44:27,203 --> 01:44:28,602
Remember me?

849
01:44:48,557 --> 01:44:50,991
He's dead!

850
01:44:50,993 --> 01:44:53,093
He's dead.

851
01:45:11,846 --> 01:45:13,312
When you're across safe,

852
01:45:13,314 --> 01:45:15,648
I'll jam the throttle and follow you.

853
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:16,816
Come on!

854
01:45:16,818 --> 01:45:18,051
Hurry!

855
01:45:18,053 --> 01:45:21,621
We're nearly at the pass.

856
01:46:07,901 --> 01:46:09,835
Witness me.

857
01:46:14,742 --> 01:46:17,109
Rictus!

858
01:47:12,198 --> 01:47:14,431
Why is she making that noise?

859
01:47:14,433 --> 01:47:16,333
She's pumping air into her chest cavity.

860
01:47:16,335 --> 01:47:21,105
She's collapsing her lungs
one breath at a time.

861
01:47:25,645 --> 01:47:27,211
I know.

862
01:47:30,383 --> 01:47:32,115
I am so sorry.

863
01:47:33,218 --> 01:47:36,119
I know. I know.

864
01:47:36,121 --> 01:47:38,855
Hold it there.

865
01:47:38,857 --> 01:47:41,057
All right.

866
01:47:41,059 --> 01:47:43,059
Put that on there. Press it on.

867
01:47:43,061 --> 01:47:44,060
Hey.

868
01:47:44,062 --> 01:47:45,628
Hey.

869
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:47,463
Home.

870
01:47:54,139 --> 01:47:56,439
Home.

871
01:48:01,179 --> 01:48:02,345
N-no.

872
01:48:02,347 --> 01:48:03,546
No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

873
01:48:03,548 --> 01:48:04,581
She's exsanguinated.

874
01:48:04,583 --> 01:48:06,149
Drained all her blood.

875
01:48:06,151 --> 01:48:08,751
Hold these.

876
01:48:08,753 --> 01:48:11,221
We need that. Thank you.

877
01:48:11,223 --> 01:48:12,856
Needle.

878
01:48:12,858 --> 01:48:14,557
Come on!

879
01:48:14,559 --> 01:48:16,626
Take this.

880
01:48:18,897 --> 01:48:20,563
Keep her awake.

881
01:48:20,565 --> 01:48:22,798
Furiosa.

882
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:29,371
Okay, that's not retracting.

883
01:48:29,373 --> 01:48:30,739
There we go.

884
01:48:30,741 --> 01:48:34,509
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

885
01:48:34,511 --> 01:48:35,677
Okay.

886
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:37,079
Sorry.

887
01:48:39,016 --> 01:48:40,883
There you go. Okay.

888
01:48:40,885 --> 01:48:42,417
There you go.

889
01:48:54,398 --> 01:48:55,864
Max.

890
01:48:55,866 --> 01:48:58,300
My name is Max.

891
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:08,877
That's my name.

892
01:49:50,253 --> 01:49:51,485
Brake!

893
01:49:56,826 --> 01:49:58,426
Reveal yourself.

894
01:50:17,446 --> 01:50:18,878
He's got something.

895
01:50:25,988 --> 01:50:27,687
It's immortan Joe.

896
01:50:27,689 --> 01:50:30,857
The immortan Joe is dead!

897
01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:58,317
Furiosa!

898
01:50:58,319 --> 01:50:59,418
Furiosa!

899
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:00,552
Furiosa!

900
01:51:00,554 --> 01:51:02,254
Furiosa!

901
01:51:02,256 --> 01:51:04,023
Furiosa!

902
01:51:04,025 --> 01:51:06,759
She's back.

903
01:51:15,336 --> 01:51:17,169
Let's do it!

904
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:18,837
Let 'em up. Come on.
