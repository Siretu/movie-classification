1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,700
Can't say that I have.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,200
You, Pip?

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,100
What do they look like?

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,200
I don't remember now.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,500
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

6
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,900
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,500
<i>...whose mind is overthrown.</i>

8
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,900
<i>Saruman's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.</i>

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,700
My lord, your son...

10
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,100
...he is dead.

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,400
My lord?

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,900
Uncle?

13
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,900
Will you not go to him?

14
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,500
Will you do nothing?

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Be careful what you say.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,000
Do not look for welcome here.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,200
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

18
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,500
What a tragedy for the king...

19
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,700
...to lose his only son and heir.

20
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,300
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,400
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,100
Leave me alone, snake!

23
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,200
Oh, but you are alone.

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,600
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

25
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,200
...in the bitter watches of the night...

26
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,000
...when all your life seems to shrink.

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,400
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,200
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,300
So fair.

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
So cold.

31
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,900
Like a morning of pale spring...

32
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,500
...still clinging to winter's chill.

33
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,800
Your words are poison.

34
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,800
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

35
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,000
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

36
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,100
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.

37
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,200
Your staff.

38
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,100
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

39
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,700
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

40
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,600
He's a herald of woe.

41
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,200
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

42
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,800
...Théoden King.

43
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,000
He's not welcome.

44
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,300
Why should I welcome you...

45
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,400
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

46
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,900
A just question, my liege.

47
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,000
Late is the hour...

48
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,100
...in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

49
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,000
Láthspell I name him.

50
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,000
Ill news is an ill guest.

51
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,800
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

52
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,900
I have not passed
through fire and death...

53
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,200
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

54
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,300
His staff.

55
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,600
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

56
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,900
Théoden...

57
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,000
...son of Thengel...

58
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,200
...too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

59
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,400
I would stay still if I were you.

60
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,700
Hearken to me!

61
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,300
I release you...

62
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
...from the spell.

63
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,100
You have no power here...

64
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,900
...Gandalf the Grey.

65
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,400
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

66
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,300
Wait.

67
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,600
If I go, Théoden dies.

68
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,500
You did not kill me...

69
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,900
...you will not kill him.

70
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,500
Rohan is mine.

71
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,300
Be gone.

72
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,900
I know your face.

73
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,800
Éowyn.

74
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,400
Éowyn.

75
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,800
Gandalf?

76
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,200
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

77
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,200
Dark have been my dreams of late.

78
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,100
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

79
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,200
...if they grasped your sword.

80
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,300
I've only...

81
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,600
...ever served you, my lord.

82
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,700
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

83
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,700
Send me not from your sight.

84
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,700
No, my lord! No, my lord.

85
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,100
Let him go.

86
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,100
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

87
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,500
Get out of my way!

88
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,900
Hail, Théoden King!

89
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,000
Where is Théodred?

90
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,600
Where is my son?

91
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,600
Simbelmynë.

92
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,300
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forbearers.

93
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

94
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,100
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

95
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,300
The young perish and the old linger.

96
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,000
That I should live...

97
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,500
...to see the last days of my house.

98
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,600
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

99
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,100
No parent should have to bury
their child.

100
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,700
He was strong in life.

101
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,300
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

102
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,900
They had no warning.

103
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,400
They were unarmed.

104
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

105
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,800
Rick, cot and tree.

106
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,400
Where is Mama?

107
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,400
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

108
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,900
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

109
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Ride out and meet him head on.

110
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,700
Draw him away from your women
and children.

111
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,700
You must fight.

112
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,700
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

113
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,500
Éomer is loyal to you.

114
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,400
His men will return
and fight for their king.

115
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,500
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

116
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,400
Éomer cannot help us.

117
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,800
I know what it is you want of me...

118
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,200
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

119
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,600
I will not risk open war.

120
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,200
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

121
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,100
When last I looked...

122
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,200
...Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

123
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,200
Then what is the king's decision?

124
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,200
<i>By order of the king...</i>

125
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,800
...the city must empty.

126
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,900
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

127
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,100
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

128
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,700
Helm's Deep.

129
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,500
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

130
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Who will defend them if not their king?

131
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,200
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

132
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,200
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

133
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,300
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

134
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,600
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

135
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,000
What they will get is a massacre.

136
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,000
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

137
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,300
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

138
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,600
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

139
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,900
The people of Rohan will need you.

140
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,700
The defenses have to hold.

141
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,900
They will hold.

142
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,200
The Grey Pilgrim.

143
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,000
That's what they used to call me.

144
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

145
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,100
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

146
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,900
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

147
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,500
At dawn, look to the east.

148
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,200
Go.

149
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,900
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

150
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,000
His name is Brego.

151
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,400
He was my cousin's horse.

152
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,400
Brego.

153
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,600
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

154
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,000
...but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

155
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,500
You speak as one of their own.

156
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,700
I was raised in Rivendell...

157
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,500
...for a time.

158
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,900
Turn this fellow free.

159
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,000
He's seen enough of war.

160
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,700
Gandalf the White.

161
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,200
Gandalf the Fool!

162
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

163
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,700
There were three
who followed the wizard.

164
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:42,500
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

165
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,600
You stink of horse.

166
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,700
The Man...

167
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,000
...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

168
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,900
One of the Dúnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

169
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,900
His cloth was poor.

170
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,900
And yet he bore a strange ring.

171
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,600
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

172
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:21,600
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

173
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,700
The Ring of Barahir.

174
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,200
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

175
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,800
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

176
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,700
The line was broken years ago.

177
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
It matters not.

178
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,300
The world of Men shall fall.

179
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,300
It will begin at Edoras.

180
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,400
I am ready, Gamling.

181
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,000
Bring my horse.

182
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,600
This is not a defeat.

183
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,200
We will return.

184
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,100
We will return.

185
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,400
You have some skill with a blade.

186
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,000
Women of this country learned long ago:

187
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,800
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

188
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,800
I fear neither death nor pain.

189
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,100
What do you fear, my lady?

190
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,400
A cage.

191
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,500
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

192
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,600
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

193
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,100
You're a daughter of kings...

194
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,600
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

195
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,400
I do not think that would be your fate.

196
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,500
<i>Théoden will not stay at Edoras.</i>

197
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,800
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

198
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,900
He will expect an attack on the city.

199
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,400
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

200
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,000
...the great fortress of Rohan.

201
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,600
<i>It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.</i>

202
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,700
<i>They will be slow.</i>

203
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,500
They will have women and children
with them.

204
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,700
Send out your Warg-riders.

205
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,400
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

206
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,300
- Why do you do that?
- What?

207
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,000
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

208
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Because.

209
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,100
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

210
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,500
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

211
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,700
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

212
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,100
You have no idea what it did to him...

213
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,800
...what it's still doing to him.

214
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,100
I want to help him, Sam.

215
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,600
Why?

216
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,000
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

217
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

218
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,100
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

219
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,200
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

220
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,100
I do.

221
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,100
It's the Ring.

222
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,200
You can't take your eyes off it.

223
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,900
I've seen you.

224
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,200
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

225
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,200
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

226
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,100
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

227
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,200
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

228
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,100
Mine! My own!

229
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,000
Can't you hear yourself?

230
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,900
Don't you know who you sound like?

231
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,300
We wants it.

232
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,200
We needs it.

233
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,200
Must have the precious.

234
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,700
They stole it from us.

235
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,300
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

236
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,300
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

237
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,800
No. Not master.

238
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,800
Yes, precious. False.

239
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,400
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

240
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,100
Master's my friend.

241
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,300
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

242
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,100
Not listening. I'm not listening.

243
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,200
You're a liar and a thief.

244
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,400
No.

245
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,300
Murderer.

246
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Go away.

247
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,300
Go away?

248
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,100
I hate you.

249
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,700
I hate you.

250
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,300
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

251
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,300
I saved us.

252
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,000
It was me. We survived because of me.

253
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,800
Not anymore.

254
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,700
What did you say?

255
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,700
Master looks after us now.

256
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,300
We don't need you.

257
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,600
What?

258
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,500
Leave now...

259
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,500
...and never come back.

260
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,700
No.

261
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,400
Leave now and never come back.

262
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,900
Leave now and never come back!

263
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,600
We told him to go away.

264
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,700
And away he goes, precious.

265
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,900
Gone! Gone! Gone!

266
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,900
Sméagol is free!

267
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,200
Look.

268
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,900
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

269
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,900
They are young.

270
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,600
They are tender. They are nice.

271
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,300
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

272
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600
You'll make him sick, you will...

273
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,000
...behaving like that.

274
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,200
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

275
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,900
What's it doing?

276
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,300
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

277
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,600
It ruins it.

278
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,500
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

279
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,200
What we need is a few good taters.

280
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,100
What's taters, precious?

281
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,000
What's taters? Eh?

282
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,900
Po-ta-toes.

283
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,500
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

284
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,500
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

285
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,700
Even you couldn't say no to that.

286
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,200
Oh, yes, we could.

287
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,900
Spoil a nice fish.

288
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,800
Give it to us raw...

289
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
...and wriggling.

290
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,300
You keep nasty chips.

291
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,300
You're hopeless.

292
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,300
Mr. Frodo?

293
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,900
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

294
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,500
Servants of Sauron.

295
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,500
They are called to Mordor.

296
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,700
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

297
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,100
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

298
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,300
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

299
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,700
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

300
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,000
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

301
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,400
Mr. Frodo.

302
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,500
Look.

303
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,400
It's an oliphaunt.

304
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,600
No one at home will believe this.

305
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,700
Sméagol?

306
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,500
We've lingered here too long.

307
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,800
Come on, Sam.

308
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,000
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

309
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,800
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

310
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,900
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

311
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,700
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

312
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,900
The enemy?

313
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,500
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

314
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,000
You wonder what his name is...

315
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,800
...where he came from.

316
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,200
And if he was really evil at heart.

317
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,300
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

318
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,400
If he would not rather have stayed there...

319
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,100
...in peace.

320
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,700
War will make corpses of us all.

321
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,900
Bind their hands.

322
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,000
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

323
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,900
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

324
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,200
...that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

325
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,500
It's the beards.

326
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,900
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

327
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,900
...that there are no Dwarf women...

328
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,300
...and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

329
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,900
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

330
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,200
It's all right. Nobody panic.

331
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

332
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,500
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

333
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,500
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

334
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,000
Cut down by Orcs.

335
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,200
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

336
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,400
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

337
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,100
Doomed to wait upon an old man
who should have loved her as a father.

338
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,500
Gimli.

339
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,800
No, I couldn't

340
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,800
I really couldn't.

341
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,900
I made some stew.

342
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,300
It isn't much, but it's hot.

343
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,200
Thank you.

344
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,200
- It's good.
- Really?

345
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,600
My uncle told me a strange thing.

346
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,900
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

347
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,900
But he must be mistaken.

348
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,500
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

349
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,900
Then you must be at least 60.

350
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,500
Seventy?

351
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,600
But you cannot be 80!

352
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,300
Eighty-seven.

353
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,500
You are one of the Dúnedain.

354
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,700
A descendant of Númenor,
blessed with long life.

355
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,600
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

356
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,000
There are few of us left.

357
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,000
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

358
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,100
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

359
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,900
<i>The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.</i>

360
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,200
<i>It is mine to give to whom I will.</i>

361
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,400
<i>Like my heart.</i>

362
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,500
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

363
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,200
I am asleep.

364
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,600
This is a dream.

365
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,000
Then it is a good dream.

366
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,100
Sleep.

367
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,000
Arwen...

368
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,300
Where is she?

369
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,900
The woman who gave you that jewel.

370
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,900
<i>Our time here is ending.</i>

371
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,200
Arwen's time is ending.

372
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,200
Let her go.

373
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Let her take the ship into the west.

374
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,700
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

375
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,600
There it will be ever green.

376
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,500
But never more than memory.

377
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,800
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

378
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,600
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

379
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,100
She belongs with her people.

380
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,200
Why are you saying this?

381
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,000
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

382
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,100
It was a dream, Arwen.

383
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,900
Nothing more.

384
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,500
I don't believe you.

385
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,400
This belongs to you.

386
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,700
It was a gift.

387
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,800
Keep it.

388
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,500
My lord?

389
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,900
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

390
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,900
What is it?

391
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.

392
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Wargs!

393
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,200
A scout!

394
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,100
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

395
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,600
Get them out of here!

396
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
All riders to the head of the column.

397
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,100
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

398
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,000
Come on!

399
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,300
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

400
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,900
- I can fight.
- No!

401
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,700
You must do this, for me.

402
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,300
Follow me!

403
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:32,200
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

404
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,000
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

405
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,500
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

406
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,900
That one counts as mine!

407
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,300
Stinking creature.

408
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,300
Aragorn!

409
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,600
Aragorn?

410
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,500
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

411
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,100
He's...

412
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,200
...dead.

413
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,800
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

414
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,700
You lie.

415
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,200
Get the wounded on horses.

416
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,600
The wolves of Isengard will return.

417
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,200
Leave the dead.

418
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,100
Come.

419
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,800
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

420
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,900
There it is, Helm's Deep.

421
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,300
We're safe!

422
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,700
We're safe, my lady.

423
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,100
Thank you.

424
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,800
- Mama!
- Éothain!

425
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,500
Freda!

426
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,100
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

427
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,300
Take it to the caves.

428
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,300
Make way for the king.

429
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,100
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

430
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,800
So few. So few of you have returned.

431
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,800
Our people are safe.

432
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,700
We have paid for it with many lives.

433
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,100
My lady.

434
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,100
Lord Aragorn...

435
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,500
...where is he?

436
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,000
He fell.

437
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,700
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

438
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,800
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

439
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,100
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

440
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,900
Get them into the caves.

441
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:56,600
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

442
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,000
<i>Helm's Deep has one weakness.</i>

443
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,500
<i>Its outer wall is solid rock...</i>

444
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,800
<i>...but for a small culvert
at its base...</i>

445
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,700
<i>...which is little more than a drain.</i>

446
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,800
How? How can fire undo stone?

447
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,500
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

448
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:30,100
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

449
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,800
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

450
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,500
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

451
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,100
Tens of thousands.

452
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:42,300
But, my lord, there is no such force.

453
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,400
A new power is rising.

454
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,600
Its victory is at hand.

455
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,300
This night...

456
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,100
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

457
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,600
March to Helm's Deep!

458
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,200
Leave none alive!

459
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,200
To war!

460
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:33,600
There will be no dawn for Men.

461
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,800
Look. There's smoke to the south.

462
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,200
There is always smoke rising...

463
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,300
...from Isengard these days.

464
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,100
Isengard?

465
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,200
There was a time...

466
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,000
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

467
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,600
But now he has a mind of metal...

468
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,700
...and wheels.

469
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,900
He no longer cares for growing things.

470
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,900
What is it?

471
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,100
It's Saruman's army.

472
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,800
The war has started.

473
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,600
<i>May the grace of the Valar
protect you.</i>

474
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,700
Brego.

475
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,100
Arwen.

476
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,600
I have made my choice.

477
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,900
He is not coming back.

478
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,700
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

479
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,600
There is still hope.

480
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,600
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

481
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,900
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

482
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,600
...and all that you hope for
comes true...

483
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:06,500
...you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

484
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,700
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

485
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,900
...Aragorn will die.

486
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,200
<i>And there will be no comfort
for you...</i>

487
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,600
<i>...no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.</i>

488
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,200
<i>He will come to death...</i>

489
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,900
<i>...an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...</i>

490
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:35,800
<i>...in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.</i>

491
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,800
<i>But you, my daughter...</i>

492
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:54,700
<i>...you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...</i>

493
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,900
<i>...as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.</i>

494
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,700
<i>Here you will dwell...</i>

495
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,800
<i>...bound to your grief
under the fading trees...</i>

496
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,500
<i>...until all the world is changed...</i>

497
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:17,200
...and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

498
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,900
Arwen.

499
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,800
There is nothing for you here...

500
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,600
...only death.

501
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,700
<i>The power of the enemy is growing.</i>

502
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,500
<i>Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...</i>

503
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,000
<i>...to destroy the people of Rohan.</i>

504
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,700
<i>Isengard has been unleashed.</i>

505
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,400
<i>The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...</i>

506
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,500
<i>...the last free kingdom of Men.</i>

507
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:44,100
<i>His war on this country
will come swiftly.</i>

508
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,900
<i>He senses the Ring is close.</i>

509
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,600
<i>The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.</i>

510
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,800
<i>In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...</i>

511
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:04,200
...the quest will claim his life.

512
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,500
You know this.

513
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,000
<i>You have foreseen it.</i>

514
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,600
<i>It is the risk we all took.</i>

515
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:24,100
<i>In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.</i>

516
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:29,700
<i>It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.</i>

517
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:35,300
<i>Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.</i>

518
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,100
<i>The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...</i>

519
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:43,400
<i>...take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.</i>

520
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,700
<i>It is close now.</i>

521
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:52,100
<i>So close to achieving its goal.</i>

522
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,800
<i>For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...</i>

523
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,100
<i>...even unto to the ending
of the world.</i>

524
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,800
<i>The time of the Elves...</i>

525
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,900
<i>...is over.</i>

526
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,400
<i>Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?</i>

527
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,600
<i>Do we let them stand alone?</i>

528
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,500
What news?

529
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,500
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

530
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,500
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

531
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:34,700
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

532
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,300
Sauron is marshaling an army.

533
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,800
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

534
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:43,300
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

535
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,000
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

536
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,200
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

537
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,600
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

538
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,500
Sauron from Mordor.

539
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,000
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

540
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,900
Gondor is weak.

541
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,200
Sauron will strike us soon.

542
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,800
And he will strike hard.

543
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,300
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

544
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,400
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

545
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,300
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

546
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,800
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

547
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,400
Speak.

548
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,100
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

549
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,400
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

550
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,400
Your bodyguard?

551
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,400
His gardener.

552
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
And where is your skulking friend?

553
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,800
That gangrel creature.

554
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,100
He had an ill-favored look.

555
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,700
There was no other.

556
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,200
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

557
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,600
One we lost in Moria...

558
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,200
...two were my kin...

559
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,100
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

560
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:32,200
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

561
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,000
You're a friend of Boromir?

562
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,900
Yes.

563
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,100
For my part.

564
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,500
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

565
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,000
Dead?

566
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,200
How? When?

567
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,100
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

568
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:07,300
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

569
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:16,500
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

570
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,800
It was cloven in two.

571
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,800
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

572
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,700
He was my brother.

573
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,600
Boromir!

574
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,000
Boromir!

575
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,000
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

576
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,800
A place of light and beauty and music.

577
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,300
And so it shall be once more!

578
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,500
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

579
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,100
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

580
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:56,600
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

581
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,900
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

582
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,900
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

583
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,400
Good speech. Nice and short.

584
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,500
Leaves more time for drinking!

585
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:21,000
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

586
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,600
Remember today, little brother.

587
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,800
Today, life is good.

588
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,600
What?

589
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,400
He's here.

590
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,400
One moment of peace,
can he not give us that?

591
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Where is he?

592
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,300
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

593
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,500
Father!

594
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,800
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

595
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,400
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

596
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,700
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

597
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,800
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

598
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

599
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,900
Oh, too few.

600
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,800
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

601
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

602
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,500
That is not my intent.

603
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:26,400
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

604
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,700
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

605
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,600
...I know his uses, and they are few.

606
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,400
We have more urgent things to speak of.

607
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,000
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

608
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,000
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

609
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:50,000
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

610
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,500
The One Ring.

611
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:02,000
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

612
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,800
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

613
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:10,100
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

614
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:14,500
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

615
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:18,400
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

616
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,500
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

617
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:28,000
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

618
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:33,200
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

619
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,900
He will return.

620
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,800
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

621
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,500
You must go.

622
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,800
Bring me back this mighty gift.

623
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:51,100
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

624
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:55,000
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

625
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,200
...send me in his stead.
- You?

626
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,300
Oh, I see.

627
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,700
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

628
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,100
I think not.

629
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,100
I trust this mission only to your brother.

630
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,200
The one who will not fail me.

631
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,400
Remember today, little brother.

632
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,800
Captain Faramir!

633
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,200
We found the third one.

634
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,700
You must come with me. Now.

635
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,000
Down there.

636
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,900
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

637
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,000
They wait for my command.

638
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,500
Shall I shoot?

639
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,800
<i>The rock and pool
Is nice and cool</i>

640
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,800
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

641
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,400
<i>Our only wish
To catch a fish</i>

642
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,300
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

643
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,700
Wait.

644
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,000
This creature is bound to me.

645
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,500
And I to him.

646
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,100
He is our guide.

647
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,200
Please...

648
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,300
...let me go down to him.

649
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,300
Sméagol.

650
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,500
Master is here.

651
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:59,800
Come, Sméagol.

652
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,300
Trust master. Come.

653
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:12,300
We must go now?

654
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:16,100
Sméagol, you must trust master.

655
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,700
Follow me. Come on.

656
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,400
Come.

657
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,100
Come, Sméagol.

658
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,700
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

659
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,800
Come on.

660
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,900
Don't hurt him!

661
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,800
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

662
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,200
Master!

663
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,400
That's enough.
