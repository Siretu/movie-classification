1
00:00:04,841 --> 00:00:07,841
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

2
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:12,428
Cruel Men hurts us.

3
00:00:12,636 --> 00:00:15,598
Master tricksed us.

4
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:19,393
Of course he did.

5
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:23,439
I told you he was tricksy.

6
00:00:23,647 --> 00:00:26,650
I told you he was false.

7
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:29,528
Master is our friend.

8
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:32,072
Our friend.

9
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,408
Master betrayed us.

10
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:37,536
No. Not its business.

11
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,123
Leave us alone!

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,667
Filthy little Hobbitses!

13
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:46,170
They stole it from us!

14
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,755
No. No.

15
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:49,965
What did they steal?

16
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:57,431
My precious!

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,686
We have to get out of here.

18
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:05,272
You go. Go, now.

19
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:09,735
You can do it.

20
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:12,655
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

21
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:14,615
Just this once.

22
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:16,575
Put it on.

23
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:18,994
Disappear.

24
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,163
I can't.

25
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,460
You were right, Sam.

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,381
You tried to tell me but...

27
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:37,263
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,728
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

29
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:47,773
If I put it on...

30
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,317
... he'll find me.

31
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,946
He'll see.

32
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:57,157
Mr. Frodo...

33
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:06,292
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

34
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,463
Here in the Wild I have you...

35
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:13,549
...two Halflings...

36
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,927
...and a host of men at my call.

37
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:23,726
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

38
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:37,156
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

39
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,785
...to show his quality.

40
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,475
No!

41
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,979
Stop it!

42
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:10,189
Leave him alone.

43
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,026
Don't you understand?

44
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,279
He's got to destroy it!

45
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:20,658
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

46
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:22,493
To the Mountain of Fire!

47
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:26,664
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

48
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:29,833
Please. It's such a burden.

49
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,129
Will you not help him?

50
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:37,383
Captain?

51
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,261
Prepare to leave.

52
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:47,685
The Ring will go to Gondor.

53
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,219
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

54
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:06,472
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

55
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,392
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

56
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,605
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

57
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,815
Bless you, laddie.

58
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,109
Gimli, where is the king?

59
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,250
You look terrible.

60
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,002
A great host, you say?

61
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,880
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

62
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,550
Ten thousand strong at least.

63
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:27,511
Ten thousand?

64
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,431
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

65
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,227
To destroy the world of Men.

66
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:39,773
They will be here by nightfall.

67
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,906
Let them come!

68
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,160
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

69
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,496
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

70
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:05,633
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

71
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:08,219
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

72
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:11,096
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

73
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,724
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

74
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,477
These are Uruk-hai.

75
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:20,105
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

76
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,402
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

77
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,198
I know how to defend my own keep.

78
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:39,250
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

79
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:44,630
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

80
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:47,466
Crops can be resown...

81
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,678
... homes rebuilt.

82
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,847
Within these walls...

83
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,724
...we will outlast them.

84
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,310
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

85
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,979
They come to destroy its people...

86
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:02,606
...down to the last child.

87
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,776
What would you have me do?

88
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,695
Look at my men.

89
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,613
Their courage hangs by a thread.

90
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:16,203
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

91
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,415
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

92
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:24,920
Send out riders, my lord.

93
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,132
You must call for aid.

94
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,679
And who will come?

95
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,681
Elves?

96
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,933
Dwarves?

97
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,562
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

98
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,648
The old alliances are dead.

99
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:47,860
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

100
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:50,279
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

101
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:54,491
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

102
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,577
Where was Gon...?

103
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:01,165
No, my Lord Aragorn...

104
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,211
...we are alone.

105
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:13,802
Get the women and children
into the caves.

106
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,221
We need more time
to lay provisions...

107
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,933
There is no time. War is upon us.

108
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,893
Secure the gate.

109
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:28,192
We Ents have not troubled...

110
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,737
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

111
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:35,532
...for a very long time.

112
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:41,539
But now, something
is about to happen...

113
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,083
...that has not happened...

114
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,752
...for an age.

115
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,256
Entmoot.

116
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,632
What's that?

117
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,885
'Tis a gathering.

118
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,639
A gathering of what?

119
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,993
Beech. Oak.

120
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,036
Chestnut. Ash.

121
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:23,289
Good. Good. Good.

122
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:25,833
Many have come.

123
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,135
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

124
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,888
...will go to war.

125
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,900
Move back! Move to the caves!

126
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,446
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

127
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,157
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

128
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,576
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

129
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,829
Aragorn, you must rest.

130
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,457
You're no use to us half alive.

131
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,083
Aragorn!

132
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:14,506
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

133
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,342
That is an honorable charge.

134
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,428
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

135
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,305
What renown is there in that?

136
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,184
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

137
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,229
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

138
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:33,400
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

139
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,528
You do not command
the others to stay!

140
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:40,491
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

141
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,827
Because they love you.

142
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,461
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,655
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

144
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,533
These are no soldiers.

145
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:10,247
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

146
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,087
Look at them. They're frightened.

147
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,714
I can see it in their eyes.

148
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,904
Then I shall die as one of them!

149
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,204
Let him go, lad.

150
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,706
Let him be.

151
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:59,672
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

152
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,803
My lord?

153
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,432
Who am I, Gamling?

154
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:17,731
You are our king, sire.

155
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,988
And do you trust your king?

156
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,659
Your men, my lord...

157
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,662
...will follow you to whatever end.

158
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,462
To whatever end.

159
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,893
Where is the horse and the rider?

160
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,104
Where is the horn that was blowing?

161
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:02,985
<i>They have passed like rain
on the mountains.</i>

162
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,239
<i>Like wind in the meadow.</i>

163
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,705
The days have gone down in the West...

164
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,042
<i>... behind the hills...</i>

165
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,587
<i>... into Shadow.</i>

166
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,474
How did it come to this?

167
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,622
It's been going for hours.

168
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,167
They must have decided something
by now.

169
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:04,421
Decided? No.

170
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:09,718
We only just finished saying...

171
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,805
...good morning.

172
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,309
But it's nighttime already.

173
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,353
You can't take forever.

174
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,356
Don't be hasty.

175
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,234
We're running out of time!

176
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,240
Move! Move to the outer wall.

177
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,134
Give me your sword.

178
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,769
What is your name?

179
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,647
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

180
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,444
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.

181
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,364
They say that it is hopeless.

182
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,842
This is a good sword.

183
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,222
Haleth, son of Háma...

184
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,728
...there is always hope.

185
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:09,046
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

186
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,756
Forgive me.

187
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,341
I was wrong to despair.

188
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,353
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

189
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,858
It's a little tight across the chest.

190
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,033
That is no Orc horn.

191
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,541
Send for the king.

192
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,336
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

193
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,620
How is this possible?

194
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:27,291
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

195
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,669
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

196
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:35,591
Long ago we fought and died together.

197
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,804
We come to honor that allegiance.

198
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,232
You are most welcome.

199
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,533
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

200
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,486
You could have picked a better spot.

201
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:46,537
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

202
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,503
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

203
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,631
Let's hope they last the night.

204
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,819
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

205
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,905
Or would you like me to find you a box?

206
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,929
So it begins.

207
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,123
Did they hit anything?

208
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,793
Give them a volley.

209
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,045
- Fire!
- Fire!

210
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,521
Send them to me! Come on!

211
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,293
Good!

212
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:12,094
Swords! Swords!

213
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,343
Legolas! Two already!

214
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,637
I'm on 17!

215
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,389
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

216
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,856
Nineteen!

217
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,259
Merry.

218
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,475
We have just agreed.

219
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:52,987
Yes?

220
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,659
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

221
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,997
...and we have agreed...

222
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:07,459
...you are not Orcs.

223
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,338
Well, that's good news.

224
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:15,676
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

225
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,097
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

226
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,807
Hasty?

227
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,518
Our friends are out there.

228
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:28,856
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

229
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,442
War? Yes.

230
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,527
It affects us all.

231
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,697
Tree, root and twig.

232
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:41,577
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

233
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,704
...it takes a long time...

234
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:48,792
...to say anything in Old Entish...

235
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:53,214
...and we never say anything...

236
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:57,301
... unless it is worth taking...

237
00:27:57,468 --> 00:28:01,430
...a long time to say.

238
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:05,559
Seventeen! Eighteen!

239
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,769
Nineteen!

240
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,230
Twenty!

241
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,023
Twenty-one!

242
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,118
Causeway!

243
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,337
Is this it?

244
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,382
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

245
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,761
Brace the gate!

246
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,406
Hold them! Stand firm!

247
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,582
Aragorn!

248
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:39,421
Gimli!

249
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:32,099
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

250
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:36,896
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

251
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,857
How can that be your decision?!

252
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:44,111
This is not our war.

253
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,655
But you're part of this world!

254
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,620
Aren't you?!

255
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,084
You must help. Please.

256
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:03,088
You must do something.

257
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:07,635
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

258
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:12,598
But your part in this tale is over.

259
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:15,017
Go back to your home.

260
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,321
Maybe Treebeard's right.

261
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,365
We don't belong here, Merry.

262
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:31,784
It's too big for us.

263
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:34,578
What can we do in the end?

264
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:39,542
We've got the Shire.

265
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,586
Maybe we should go home.

266
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,675
The fires of Isengard will spread...

267
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:52,763
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

268
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,515
And...

269
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,395
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

270
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,818
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

271
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,589
Aragorn!

272
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,174
Fall back to the Keep!

273
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:32,386
Get your men out of there!

274
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,772
Haldir!

275
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,113
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

276
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:11,550
Haldir!

277
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,761
Brace the gate!

278
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,265
Hold them!

279
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:04,436
To the gate. Draw your swords!

280
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,508
Make way!

281
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:39,138
We cannot hold much longer!

282
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:48,731
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

283
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:51,483
As long as you can give me.

284
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,319
Gimli!

285
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,155
Timbers!

286
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,282
Brace the gate!

287
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,715
Come on. We can take them.

288
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:17,176
It's a long way.

289
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:24,183
Toss me.

290
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,186
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

291
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:28,938
You'll have to toss me!

292
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:35,819
Don't tell the Elf.

293
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,113
Not a word.

294
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:54,838
Shore up the door!

295
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,132
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

296
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,342
Watch our backs!

297
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,640
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

298
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,025
Hold fast the gate!

299
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:03,199
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

300
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:09,496
Aragorn!

301
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,449
Pull everybody back.

302
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:47,576
Pull them back.

303
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,578
Fall back!

304
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,248
Fall back!

305
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,125
They have broken through!

306
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,545
The castle is breached. Retreat!

307
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,964
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

308
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:02,675
Hurry! I nside. Get them inside!

309
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:05,135
I nto the Keep!

310
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:21,569
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

311
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:26,448
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

312
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,455
Wait! Stop!

313
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,833
Stop!

314
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:40,671
Turn around.

315
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:44,300
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

316
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:49,471
But that will lead you past Isengard.

317
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:52,516
Yes. Exactly.

318
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:55,936
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

319
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,772
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

320
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,900
It's the last thing he'll expect.

321
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:06,572
That doesn't make sense to me.

322
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:07,907
But then...

323
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,743
...you are very small.

324
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:12,995
Perhaps you're right.

325
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,166
South it is, then.

326
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:22,046
Hold on, little Shirelings.

327
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,842
I always like going south.

328
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:31,305
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

329
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:34,391
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

330
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,518
No, we won't.

331
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:39,521
Not this time.

332
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:47,154
Look!

333
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,283
Osgiliath burns!

334
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,868
Mordor has come.

335
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:56,455
The Ring will not save Gondor.

336
00:40:57,748 --> 00:40:59,959
It has only the power to destroy.

337
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:02,253
Please...

338
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:04,046
...let me go.

339
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,632
Hurry.

340
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,512
Faramir!

341
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,181
You must let me go!

342
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,102
And those little family of field mice...

343
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:21,105
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

344
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:25,150
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

345
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:39,290
Many of these trees were my friends.

346
00:41:39,957 --> 00:41:44,587
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

347
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:46,964
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

348
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,925
They had voices of their own.

349
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,722
Saruman.

350
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:58,142
A wizard should know better!

351
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:15,993
There is no curse in Elvish...

352
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:18,871
... Entish or the tongues of Men...

353
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:21,373
...for this treachery.

354
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,628
Look! The trees! They're moving!

355
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:31,550
Where are they going?

356
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:35,304
They have business with the Orcs.

357
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:40,017
My business is with Isengard tonight...

358
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:42,853
...with rock and stone.

359
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:07,878
Yes.

360
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:10,422
Come, my friends.

361
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:15,970
The Ents are going to war.

362
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:17,888
It is likely...

363
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:21,600
...that we go to our doom.

364
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:25,479
Last march...

365
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,023
...of the Ents.

366
00:44:16,155 --> 00:44:19,867
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

367
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:22,119
By nightfall we will be overrun.

368
00:44:24,872 --> 00:44:26,373
Mr. Frodo?

369
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:30,753
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

370
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,422
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

371
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:49,188
Take them to my father.

372
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:53,776
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

373
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:59,198
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

374
00:45:00,324 --> 00:45:02,993
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

375
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:06,413
You want to know
why your brother died?

376
00:45:06,914 --> 00:45:10,626
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

377
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,753
He tried to kill him!

378
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,256
The Ring drove your brother mad!

379
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:17,883
Watch out!

380
00:45:28,811 --> 00:45:29,937
Mr. Frodo?

381
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:34,400
They're here.

382
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:39,947
They've come.

383
00:45:42,575 --> 00:45:44,493
Nazgúl!

384
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:08,684
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

385
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:12,730
Take cover!

386
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,624
The fortress is taken.

387
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:33,626
It is over.

388
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:37,713
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

389
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,841
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

390
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:44,970
They're breaking in!

391
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:50,100
They're past the door!

392
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:57,608
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

393
00:47:00,236 --> 00:47:02,154
Is there no other way?

394
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:06,784
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

395
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:09,620
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

396
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,919
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

397
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:19,964
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

398
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:25,553
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

399
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:31,684
Ride out with me.

400
00:47:35,813 --> 00:47:37,398
Ride out and meet them.

401
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,359
For death and glory.

402
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:41,902
For Rohan.

403
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:44,864
For your people.

404
00:47:45,656 --> 00:47:47,575
The sun is rising.

405
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,082
<i>Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.</i>

406
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:56,625
<i>At dawn...</i>

407
00:47:56,834 --> 00:47:58,502
<i>... look to the east.</i>

408
00:48:02,673 --> 00:48:04,300
Yes.

409
00:48:06,802 --> 00:48:08,429
Yes.

410
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:12,182
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

411
00:48:12,349 --> 00:48:15,144
...shall sound in the Deep...

412
00:48:15,603 --> 00:48:17,605
...one last time.

413
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:19,231
Yes!

414
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,113
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

415
00:48:33,913 --> 00:48:35,247
Fell deeds, awake.

416
00:48:36,457 --> 00:48:37,499
Now for wrath...

417
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:41,128
... now for ruin and a red dawn.

418
00:48:48,177 --> 00:48:50,429
Forth Eorlingas!

419
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:39,395
Gandalf.

420
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:50,406
Théoden King stands alone.

421
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:53,158
Not alone.

422
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:54,660
Rohirrim!

423
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:01,750
Éomer.

424
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:04,461
To the king!

425
00:51:22,122 --> 00:51:23,874
Yes!

426
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:36,470
A hit. A fine hit.

427
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:03,455
Break the dam!

428
00:52:03,622 --> 00:52:07,084
Release the river!

429
00:52:34,445 --> 00:52:37,156
Pippin! Hold on!

430
00:52:42,453 --> 00:52:45,372
Hold on, little Hobbits.

431
00:53:26,664 --> 00:53:28,666
What are you doing?

432
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:38,842
Where are you going?

433
00:54:37,026 --> 00:54:38,360
It's me.

434
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:43,073
It's your Sam.

435
00:54:47,453 --> 00:54:50,039
Don't you know your Sam?

436
00:55:07,723 --> 00:55:11,060
I can't do this, Sam.

437
00:55:11,977 --> 00:55:13,938
I know.

438
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,399
It's all wrong.

439
00:55:18,108 --> 00:55:20,152
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

440
00:55:27,576 --> 00:55:29,620
But we are.

441
00:55:36,085 --> 00:55:39,088
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

442
00:55:39,296 --> 00:55:41,674
The ones that really mattered.

443
00:55:42,716 --> 00:55:45,719
Full of darkness and danger they were.

444
00:55:45,928 --> 00:55:48,889
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

445
00:55:49,056 --> 00:55:51,976
...because how could the end be happy?

446
00:55:54,562 --> 00:55:56,772
<i>How could the world go back
to the way it was...</i>

447
00:55:56,897 --> 00:56:00,359
<i>... when so much bad had happened?</i>

448
00:56:01,193 --> 00:56:03,070
Victory!

449
00:56:03,279 --> 00:56:04,822
We have victory!

450
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:08,909
<i>But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...</i>

451
00:56:09,118 --> 00:56:10,452
<i>... this shadow.</i>

452
00:56:10,578 --> 00:56:12,997
<i>Even darkness must pass.</i>

453
00:56:13,163 --> 00:56:15,875
<i>A new day will come.</i>

454
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:20,004
<i>And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.</i>

455
00:56:21,964 --> 00:56:24,300
<i>Those were the stories
that stayed with you...</i>

456
00:56:24,466 --> 00:56:26,218
<i>... that meant something.</i>

457
00:56:26,427 --> 00:56:29,013
<i>Even if you were too small
to understand why.</i>

458
00:56:30,347 --> 00:56:34,226
<i>But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.</i>

459
00:56:34,393 --> 00:56:35,936
<i>I know now.</i>

460
00:56:36,812 --> 00:56:38,981
Folk in those stories...

461
00:56:39,148 --> 00:56:43,277
... had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

462
00:56:43,485 --> 00:56:45,696
They kept going...

463
00:56:46,363 --> 00:56:49,617
...because they were holding
on to something.

464
00:56:51,285 --> 00:56:53,537
What are we holding on to, Sam?

465
00:57:05,424 --> 00:57:09,386
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

466
00:57:09,678 --> 00:57:12,264
And it's worth fighting for.

467
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:43,504
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

468
00:57:44,296 --> 00:57:48,217
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

469
00:57:48,384 --> 00:57:50,594
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

470
00:57:54,974 --> 00:57:56,350
Then it is forfeit.

471
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:00,855
Release them.

472
00:58:12,908 --> 00:58:14,994
Stay out of the forest!

473
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,954
Keep away from the trees!

474
00:59:07,796 --> 00:59:09,548
Final count...

475
00:59:09,757 --> 00:59:12,635
...42.
- Forty-two?

476
00:59:14,136 --> 00:59:18,891
That's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

477
00:59:19,683 --> 00:59:23,354
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

478
00:59:27,483 --> 00:59:30,736
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

479
00:59:31,529 --> 00:59:34,031
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

480
00:59:34,198 --> 00:59:38,911
...because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

481
00:59:41,163 --> 00:59:45,834
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

482
00:59:46,126 --> 00:59:49,630
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

483
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:52,800
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

484
00:59:52,967 --> 00:59:55,803
I hear the staff are very good.

485
01:00:01,475 --> 01:00:03,853
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

486
01:00:03,978 --> 01:00:08,274
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

487
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,692
I'm starving.

488
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:12,903
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

489
01:00:13,153 --> 01:00:16,156
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

490
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:42,558
Saruman's storeroom!

491
01:00:44,977 --> 01:00:47,646
I don't believe it.

492
01:00:47,855 --> 01:00:49,857
It can't be.

493
01:00:50,524 --> 01:00:53,402
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

494
01:00:54,737 --> 01:00:56,989
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

495
01:00:57,406 --> 01:01:00,409
It's perfect. One barrel each.

496
01:01:00,576 --> 01:01:01,702
Wait.

497
01:01:02,494 --> 01:01:03,662
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

498
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,414
Share it?

499
01:01:07,249 --> 01:01:09,627
No. No.

500
01:01:11,128 --> 01:01:12,463
Dead plant and all that.

501
01:01:12,922 --> 01:01:15,090
Don't think he'd understand.

502
01:01:16,342 --> 01:01:18,510
Could be a distant relative.

503
01:01:19,345 --> 01:01:21,847
I get it.

504
01:01:22,056 --> 01:01:24,850
Don't be hasty.

505
01:01:25,976 --> 01:01:27,728
Exactly.

506
01:01:28,812 --> 01:01:31,023
Bar-hrum.

507
01:01:56,715 --> 01:01:58,008
This is the old sewer.

508
01:01:58,217 --> 01:02:01,220
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

509
01:02:01,428 --> 01:02:03,138
You'll find cover in the woods there.

510
01:02:04,223 --> 01:02:06,684
Captain Faramir...

511
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:09,144
...you have shown your quality, sir.

512
01:02:11,689 --> 01:02:12,940
The very highest.

513
01:02:13,482 --> 01:02:16,068
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

514
01:02:16,277 --> 01:02:19,196
...where gardeners are held in high honor.

515
01:02:20,406 --> 01:02:22,366
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

516
01:02:22,992 --> 01:02:24,535
Gollum says there's a path...

517
01:02:24,743 --> 01:02:28,664
... near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

518
01:02:29,164 --> 01:02:30,875
Cirith Ungol?

519
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:37,006
- Is that its name?
- No.

520
01:02:37,172 --> 01:02:38,799
No!

521
01:02:39,633 --> 01:02:42,636
- Yes.
- Frodo...

522
01:02:43,053 --> 01:02:46,557
...they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

523
01:02:47,474 --> 01:02:49,977
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

524
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:56,609
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

525
01:02:58,152 --> 01:02:59,904
I must.

526
01:03:03,449 --> 01:03:06,994
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

527
01:03:07,203 --> 01:03:09,205
Thank you.

528
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:25,137
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

529
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,151
Come on, keep up.

530
01:03:42,655 --> 01:03:45,449
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

531
01:03:46,075 --> 01:03:47,910
You know that, don't you?

532
01:03:48,702 --> 01:03:50,287
He was trying to save you, see?

533
01:03:50,788 --> 01:03:52,331
Save me?

534
01:03:52,665 --> 01:03:54,833
So there's no hard feelings.

535
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,089
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

536
01:04:00,256 --> 01:04:02,883
Gollum, Gollum.

537
01:04:03,968 --> 01:04:05,678
Yes, master.

538
01:04:06,762 --> 01:04:09,598
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

539
01:04:09,807 --> 01:04:12,059
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

540
01:04:17,606 --> 01:04:22,778
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

541
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:32,913
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

542
01:04:33,581 --> 01:04:37,126
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

543
01:04:42,298 --> 01:04:45,759
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

544
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:49,972
<i>... somewhere in the wilderness.</i>

545
01:04:53,225 --> 01:04:56,687
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

546
01:04:56,854 --> 01:04:58,189
What?

547
01:04:58,355 --> 01:05:02,276
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

548
01:05:02,443 --> 01:05:05,696
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

549
01:05:05,863 --> 01:05:08,782
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

550
01:05:08,949 --> 01:05:10,618
"Yes, my boy.

551
01:05:10,826 --> 01:05:14,622
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

552
01:05:14,788 --> 01:05:17,333
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

553
01:05:17,499 --> 01:05:19,376
"Samwise the Brave."

554
01:05:19,585 --> 01:05:22,296
I want to hear more about Sam.

555
01:05:26,634 --> 01:05:29,595
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

556
01:05:30,971 --> 01:05:35,017
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

557
01:05:36,101 --> 01:05:37,478
So was I.

558
01:05:46,362 --> 01:05:49,031
"Samwise the Brave."

559
01:05:53,369 --> 01:05:54,662
Sméagol?

560
01:05:54,828 --> 01:05:57,748
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

561
01:05:57,915 --> 01:05:59,833
Master.

562
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:02,920
Master looks after us.

563
01:06:03,671 --> 01:06:06,465
Master wouldn't hurt us.

564
01:06:06,674 --> 01:06:09,134
Master broke his promise.

565
01:06:09,301 --> 01:06:11,470
Don't ask Sméagol.

566
01:06:11,637 --> 01:06:14,849
Poor, poor Sméagol.

567
01:06:15,015 --> 01:06:17,852
Master betrayed us.

568
01:06:18,018 --> 01:06:21,105
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

569
01:06:21,313 --> 01:06:25,192
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

570
01:06:25,401 --> 01:06:28,112
Kill him! Kill him!

571
01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:29,738
Kill them both!

572
01:06:29,947 --> 01:06:33,576
And then we take the precious...

573
01:06:33,742 --> 01:06:37,288
...and we be the master!

574
01:06:37,955 --> 01:06:40,624
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

575
01:06:40,791 --> 01:06:43,460
Eyes always watching.

576
01:06:43,627 --> 01:06:47,214
Then we stabs them out.

577
01:06:47,339 --> 01:06:51,886
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

578
01:06:52,094 --> 01:06:55,514
Yes. Yes. Yes.

579
01:06:55,723 --> 01:06:58,392
Kill them both.

580
01:06:58,601 --> 01:07:00,978
Yes. No! No!

581
01:07:01,187 --> 01:07:04,857
It's too risky. It's too risky.

582
01:07:05,608 --> 01:07:08,194
Where is he? Where has he gone?

583
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,946
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Sméagol?

584
01:07:11,113 --> 01:07:16,535
We could let her do it.

585
01:07:17,536 --> 01:07:21,624
Yes. She could do it.

586
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:26,337
Yes, precious, she could.

587
01:07:26,587 --> 01:07:32,551
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

588
01:07:33,552 --> 01:07:36,388
Once they're dead.

589
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:44,480
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

590
01:07:44,688 --> 01:07:46,732
Sméagol will show you the way.

591
01:07:46,899 --> 01:07:49,109
Follow me.
