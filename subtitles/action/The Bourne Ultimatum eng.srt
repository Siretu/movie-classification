1
00:02:21,203 --> 00:02:22,670
Send him in.

2
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,216
Will you commit to this program?

3
00:02:39,154 --> 00:02:40,416
I can't.

4
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:53,398
Will you commit to this program?

5
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,910
Will you commit to this program?

6
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:07,976
I can't.

7
00:04:13,315 --> 00:04:14,441
There's no place it
won't catch up to you.

8
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:16,984
It's how every story ends.

9
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:19,748
It's what you are, Jason, a killer.

10
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,355
You always will be.

11
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:24,984
Go ahead. Go on.
Go on! Do it! Do it!

12
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:30,222
She wouldn't want me to.

13
00:04:30,298 --> 00:04:32,766
That's the only reason you're alive.

14
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,301
Who is "she"?

15
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:37,133
Marie Kreutz, his girlfriend.

16
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:38,866
She was killed in India.

17
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,068
Director of Operations
Ward Abbott arranged it.

18
00:04:45,513 --> 00:04:49,176
So we have a dirty section
chief who kills Bourne's girl.

19
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:52,482
Bourne comes back for revenge,
tapes Abbott's confession...

20
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:54,647
And Abbott commits suicide.

21
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:56,884
Now Bourne's gunning for us.

22
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:59,691
You couldn't make this stuff up.

23
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:05,092
Bourne's last confirmed location
was Moscow, six weeks ago.

24
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,190
Right.
Sir.

25
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:07,963
He's on the run.
He's dangerous.

26
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:11,267
Well, sir, with respect, I think
something else could be going on here.

27
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:13,671
What? What's he after?

28
00:05:13,742 --> 00:05:17,200
The reason Bourne went to Moscow was
to see the daughter of his first target.

29
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,610
What's your point, Pam?

30
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,205
Maybe he was retracing his steps.

31
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:24,047
He's looking for something.
Something in his past.

32
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:27,282
Maybe he hasn't found it yet
and we need to know what it is.

33
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:30,188
Are you telling me he's
not a threat to this agency?

34
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:33,193
I think if he wanted to hurt us,
he could have sent the tape to CNN.

35
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:35,058
Maybe he still will.

36
00:05:36,564 --> 00:05:40,898
My number one rule is hope for
the best, plan for the worst.

37
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:47,534
As far as I'm concerned, Bourne is still
a serious threat until proven otherwise.

38
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:49,133
Let's keep looking.

39
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,075
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

40
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:36,984
This one's three years ago.
They had half of Interpol after him.

41
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:40,755
Turned up in Naples, Berlin, Moscow...

42
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:42,524
Disappeared again.

43
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:45,591
The girl that he was on the run with.

44
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:50,967
Marie Kreutz. She was found dead
in a river halfway round the world.

45
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:53,634
She'd been shot in the head.

46
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,410
What connects the dots?

47
00:07:09,357 --> 00:07:11,450
Turn off the tape recorder.

48
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:01,936
Where's my sister?

49
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:08,215
Why don't you sit down?

50
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:21,184
Where is she?

51
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,499
She's dead.

52
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,229
She was killed.

53
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:34,773
I'm sorry.

54
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,088
I knew this could end this way.

55
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:53,158
It was always gonna end this way.

56
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:55,458
I didn't believe that.

57
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:05,736
And how did she die?

58
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:10,467
She was shot.

59
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:15,574
We were together in India.

60
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,677
He came for me.

61
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:24,515
You killed him?

62
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:28,954
Yes.

63
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:31,521
And now what?

64
00:09:34,402 --> 00:09:37,997
Someone started all of this
and I'm gonna find them.

65
00:09:49,784 --> 00:09:51,513
Hey. It's me.

66
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:54,851
Yeah. He knows the whole story.

67
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:57,449
Bourne's just the tip of the iceberg.

68
00:09:57,525 --> 00:10:00,392
Have you heard of an
Operation Blackbriar?

69
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:02,562
I'm gonna get my head
around this and type it up.

70
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,756
I'll see you first thing.

71
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:04,991
Okay.

72
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:22,981
Scanning. Go Sat 21.
I have a hit on ECHELON. Blackbriar.

73
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:24,541
I repeat, Blackbriar.

74
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:28,055
Looks like it's coming
from a European signal.

75
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:29,851
NSA, please confirm your receipt.

76
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,490
I'll bring up the frequency
and the coordinates...

77
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,959
Intercept of our principal...

78
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:36,087
Sir!
What you got?

79
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:39,065
We intercepted a call in London.
Keyword, "Blackbriar."

80
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,498
Okay, send it to New York right away.

81
00:11:00,455 --> 00:11:01,479
Track the phone?

82
00:11:01,556 --> 00:11:03,581
Registered to a London
reporter named Simon Ross.

83
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:05,285
Works at the Guardian newspaper.

84
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,725
You're tracking him?
Sir. Yeah.

85
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:07,818
Thanks, Mike.

86
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:10,329
We have a survey team
covering him at work...

87
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:12,332
And a sneak and peek's on
their way to his apartment.

88
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,425
Well, who talked to him?
How did he find out about Blackbriar?

89
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:16,026
I don't know.
We pulled his background...

90
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:18,072
And ran a cross-check
on any known anomalies.

91
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:21,165
We've come up with nothing. But I think
if we follow Ross, we're gonna be able...

92
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:23,972
Ray, Ross is easy.
We want the source.

93
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:43,123
Have you heard of an
Operation Blackbriar?

94
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:44,459
You have details?

95
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:45,931
I'm gonna get my head
around this and type it up.

96
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,332
I'll see you first thing.

97
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,166
Is that all?
Yeah.

98
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,274
I want rendition protocols and put
the asset on standby, just in case.

99
00:11:59,314 --> 00:12:01,942
People, listen up!
This is a full priority situation.

100
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:03,540
Jimmy, give me Ross' profile on one.

101
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:05,210
Yes, sir.

102
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:10,920
Our target is a British national, Simon Ross.
A reporter.

103
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:15,725
I want all his phones,
his Blackberry, his apartment, his car...

104
00:12:15,797 --> 00:12:18,027
Bank accounts, credit cards,
travel patterns.

105
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:20,192
I want to know what he's
gonna think before he does.

106
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:22,065
Every dirty little secret he has.

107
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:26,470
And most of all, we want the name
and real-time location of his source.

108
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,772
This is NSA priority
level four. Any questions?

109
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:33,310
All right, let's get to it.

110
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:06,837
What?

111
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:11,216
Will you commit to this program?

112
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:17,653
I can't.

113
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,904
Copy that.
Mr. Wills, the subject is entering his office.

114
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:13,344
Give me some eyeballs on the street.

115
00:14:13,414 --> 00:14:14,745
Where's my picture, please?

116
00:14:14,816 --> 00:14:16,249
Coming online.

117
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:17,807
Online now.

118
00:14:19,454 --> 00:14:21,581
Jimmy, how you doing
with the phone line?

119
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:24,557
Yeah, we have an office line.
We're working on his cell.

120
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,616
How long?
An hour, sir.

121
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:28,253
That's too long.

122
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,620
So how do we know he's
not spinning for someone?

123
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:32,825
There was more. He was scared.

124
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,266
Scared about what?
Blackbriar.

125
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:38,468
Sorry. Call for you.
Who is it?

126
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:40,530
Won't give his name.

127
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:41,939
Excuse me.

128
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:45,636
He's on my line.
Thanks.

129
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:49,575
Simon Ross.

130
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,981
Camera three, screen.

131
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:52,349
Why aren't we hearing this?

132
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,116
Jimmy? That's a hard line, Jimmy.
Why don't we have it?

133
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:58,488
We have his line, sir, but he's not on it.
He's using a different phone.

134
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,891
I've been reading your stories.

135
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:03,557
Who is this?
This is Jason Bourne.

136
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:08,066
Waterloo Station. South entrance.
Thirty minutes. Come alone.

137
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:13,638
Get me audio as soon as you can, Ted.

138
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,198
Street teams Alpha, Bravo.

139
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:16,709
Okay, guys, let's work it. Come on.

140
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:18,540
Where's he going?

141
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:21,673
Okay, he is on the move.
Give me eyeballs on the street. Let's go.

142
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:36,023
Subject exiting the building.

143
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:38,497
All right, everyone,
let's find out where he's going.

144
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:45,568
Mobile One, I need audio.

145
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,937
Audio engaged.

146
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:48,737
Mobile One should have him.
Mobile One should have him.

147
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:51,642
Get Mobile One on it.
Let me know when you hear it.

148
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:54,112
Hi. Waterloo Station,
south entrance.

149
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:55,341
Mr. Wills.
Where's he going?

150
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,713
Destination is Waterloo Station.

151
00:15:56,784 --> 00:15:57,808
Okay, Waterloo Station.

152
00:15:57,885 --> 00:16:00,353
Give me eyes at Waterloo.
Put everyone in play.

153
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:02,446
Let's activate the asset.
Mobilise Tracker Three.

154
00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:23,933
Are we at the bridge yet?
Not yet, sir.

155
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:25,103
Okay, Mobile Three,
tell them to stay back.

156
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:26,203
Sir.

157
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,474
Please maintain visual contact.

158
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:44,025
Prepaid phone.

159
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:47,757
Here you go.

160
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:58,509
Mobile One, give me the
subject's current location.

161
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:01,941
Copy that.

162
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:05,452
Sir, the subject is arriving at the
south entrance of Waterloo Station.

163
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:51,587
Hello?

164
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:52,826
Give me that on five and seven as well.

165
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,992
Jimmy, I need that phone.

166
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:57,403
I want you to listen very carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

167
00:17:57,471 --> 00:17:58,529
What the hell's going on?

168
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:01,837
Ten o'clock, to your left, across the street,
there's a silver Chrysler Voyager.

169
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:04,173
There's a surveillance team inside.

170
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:06,213
Directly across the
street, twelve noon...

171
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,214
There's a man on the
second story, static post.

172
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:09,977
He's watching you.

173
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:12,816
Now, there's a bus stop
50 metres to your left.

174
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:13,876
I want you to walk towards it.

175
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:15,922
Jimmy, I need that phone!
I need it yesterday.

176
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,083
He's on the move.
He's on the move.

177
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,319
That's not his phone, sir.

178
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:20,417
Say again?

179
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:21,620
That's not his phone, sir.

180
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:22,958
What do you mean that's not his phone?

181
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,759
Where the hell did he get another phone?

182
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,895
Well, no, you just have to...

183
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:28,400
Grab Team B, stand by.

184
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:29,800
Grab Team B.
We're in position.

185
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,929
All right, there's a man
in a blue hooded sweatshirt.

186
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:35,032
He's talking on a phone.
Walk directly to him and stop.

187
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:37,907
Jimmy, we need the call.
I need that cell phone.

188
00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:40,378
Do not let him get out of sight.

189
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:42,382
All right, turn around.

190
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:49,114
Okay, who's the guy in the blue hood?

191
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,021
Is that his contact?

192
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,185
All right, there's a bus coming.
It'll be there in ten seconds.

193
00:18:55,262 --> 00:18:57,560
When it stops, I want you to
walk directly to your left.

194
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:00,498
There's an overpass. Go up the stairs.
Stop at the newsstand.

195
00:19:00,568 --> 00:19:02,035
You'll get further instructions.

196
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:03,730
Okay. Okay.

197
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:04,896
Get ready to move.

198
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:06,396
Watch that bus.
Watch that bus.

199
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:07,702
What? All right, what's going on?

200
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,174
Somebody tell me. We lost the feed.
Grab Team B.

201
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:10,904
Intercept the contact
and stay with Ross.

202
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:16,311
Hey! Stop!

203
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:20,510
Mobile One.
Target's on the move.

204
00:19:22,123 --> 00:19:24,114
Okay, he's on the move.
Do not lose Ross.

205
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:26,091
Blue hood! Down! Now!

206
00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:31,556
Go! Let's go.

207
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:32,997
Oh, shit.

208
00:19:36,737 --> 00:19:37,726
What the hell was that?

209
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:43,134
Sir, we've lost all
communication with Mobile One.

210
00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:50,612
To the right! Heading west.
Let us know when you get a visual!

211
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:52,743
What was the last
known position, please?

212
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,256
On the walkway,
heading towards the concourse, sir.

213
00:19:56,323 --> 00:20:00,419
It's a surveillance nightmare.
It's the busiest terminal in London.

214
00:20:00,494 --> 00:20:02,223
Give me all of CCTV's eyes.

215
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:03,320
On it, sir.

216
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:05,192
Sir, asset's on scene.

217
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:32,415
Who's your source?

218
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:33,926
What's his name?
What's your source's name?

219
00:20:33,994 --> 00:20:36,360
Look, what's going on?
Why are these people after me?

220
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,727
Because you found something.

221
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:39,698
You talked to someone inside Treadstone.

222
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,564
Someone who was there at
the beginning. Who is it?

223
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:42,932
You know I can't tell you that.

224
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:47,337
You have no idea what you're into here.
These people will kill you, if they have to.

225
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:49,467
Was it Blackbriar?
Is that what this is?

226
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:50,840
What's Blackbriar?

227
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:54,347
Treadstone upgrade.
My source told me it all started with you.

228
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:57,680
He said that you were square one,
the dirty little secret.

229
00:20:57,751 --> 00:20:59,981
He said he knows who you are.

230
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:05,684
All right, we have to move.

231
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:08,222
Answer your phone.

232
00:21:11,098 --> 00:21:13,532
Coming online.
You got visual?

233
00:21:14,602 --> 00:21:16,001
Where the hell is he, people?

234
00:21:19,206 --> 00:21:22,573
Do exactly as I say.
I need you to move up to your right.

235
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:24,907
First escalator on the right.

236
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:42,118
Tie your shoe. Tie your shoe
right now. Tie your shoe.

237
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:50,261
Wait.

238
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:52,464
Wait.

239
00:21:57,244 --> 00:21:59,940
I'm gonna walk by you.
I want you to move along the far wall...

240
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:04,007
To your left in four,
three, two, one.

241
00:22:04,118 --> 00:22:05,449
Stand up.

242
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:06,884
That's it.

243
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,419
Where the hell is he?

244
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:13,551
We cannot afford to
lose this guy, people.

245
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:21,633
All right, that line you're on is good.
Stay on that line. Stay on that line.

246
00:22:21,702 --> 00:22:24,569
I've gotta go and pick up the kids.
Can you go and get the shopping done?

247
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:27,766
Oh, the bin man,
I think he's one of them.

248
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:29,570
The garbage man? Negative.

249
00:22:29,643 --> 00:22:32,441
Oh, Jesus. Jesus!
He's reaching for something.

250
00:22:32,513 --> 00:22:33,605
Oh, God, he's got a gun.
Stay on the line.

251
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:35,114
He's got a gun.
He's got a gun.

252
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:36,809
Stay on the line you're on.
Do not deviate.

253
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:41,052
Okay, there he is!
Here he goes.

254
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:42,145
Grab Team A. Go!

255
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:43,382
He's still talking to somebody.

256
00:22:43,457 --> 00:22:45,152
He's getting instructions.
Jimmy, get me the conversation.

257
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:46,556
Mobile Two, I want...
Come on, lock the box.

258
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:48,185
Lock the box.
Move in, Grab Team C.

259
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:51,964
Hurry, Ross. We gotta move.

260
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:53,659
Okay, move through this crowd.
Move through this crowd.

261
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:55,429
Get undercover right now.
Move through this crowd.

262
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:04,833
Get in the store.

263
00:23:04,912 --> 00:23:06,880
There's someone on your tail.
Get in the store.

264
00:23:06,947 --> 00:23:08,437
You're gonna proceed out the east exit.

265
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:11,643
That's to your right as
you come into the store.

266
00:23:19,994 --> 00:23:21,655
Head into the liquor
store in front of you.

267
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:24,197
Go into the back and lock the door.

268
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,962
Mobile Four is down.

269
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:30,996
This guy's got help.
Tell me when the asset's in the nest.

270
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:37,310
Get me a feed in there!

271
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:40,575
I want Grab Team C in there.
Tell me what's going on.

272
00:23:47,821 --> 00:23:49,482
Team Four is mobile.

273
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:30,053
Jesus Christ.

274
00:24:31,198 --> 00:24:33,189
That's Jason Bourne.

275
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:36,361
He's picking us apart.
Do you think he's the source?

276
00:24:36,537 --> 00:24:38,061
He's gotta be.

277
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:44,272
Block all the exits.
Give the asset a green light.

278
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:47,342
Take them both out.

279
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:06,523
Stay there.

280
00:25:07,534 --> 00:25:11,402
I'm gonna get us out of here.
You gotta do exactly what I say.

281
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,535
Listen to me!
This isn't some story in a newspaper.

282
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:17,702
This is real.
You understand me?

283
00:25:18,178 --> 00:25:19,372
Okay.

284
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:31,146
Call all agents back.

285
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:33,716
Give Bourne's location at the
back of the store to the asset.

286
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:34,783
Yes, sir.

287
00:25:53,313 --> 00:25:54,940
Kill the cameras.

288
00:26:00,954 --> 00:26:03,047
Bourne.
Wait. Something's not right.

289
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,158
I can see the entrance from here.
If I go now, I can make it.

290
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:11,423
Bourne?

291
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:13,261
Just stay where you are.

292
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,526
I don't think we should wait!

293
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,838
I think someone's coming.

294
00:26:18,906 --> 00:26:19,964
I'm going for it.

295
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,200
No, no, no, no, no!

296
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:06,775
We have a situation.

297
00:28:11,685 --> 00:28:13,277
Yeah.

298
00:28:13,353 --> 00:28:15,082
Director Kramer would like to see you.

299
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:16,281
We need to get those warrants...

300
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:18,654
He said it's urgent.

301
00:29:17,217 --> 00:29:21,017
What the police will tell me is that
they believe the victim is 35-year-old...

302
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:24,489
Simon Ross, a well-known
journalist based here in London...

303
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:26,321
With the Guardian newspaper.

304
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:28,987
It appears that he was gunned down...

305
00:29:29,062 --> 00:29:31,724
Right in the middle of the
Waterloo Station concourse...

306
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:34,358
Around 3:45 this afternoon...

307
00:29:34,434 --> 00:29:37,130
In full view of hundreds of commuters.

308
00:29:37,204 --> 00:29:38,762
Over the years,
he's uncovered a lot of...

309
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:41,806
Unsavoury stories about terror...

310
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:45,140
That have upset certain
Western governments and...

311
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:10,365
Hi, how are you?
Right over there?

312
00:30:10,437 --> 00:30:11,631
All right.

313
00:30:12,372 --> 00:30:13,805
Good morning, sir. Can I take your order?
Yes.

314
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:18,743
I'll have the Heart-healthy omelet
with goat cheese and peppers, please.

315
00:30:18,812 --> 00:30:20,712
Anything for you, ma'am?
Just coffee, please.

316
00:30:20,781 --> 00:30:21,941
Are you sure? I'm buying.

317
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:23,107
I'm good.

318
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,977
So, when the Director called and it
was suggested that we bring you on...

319
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:32,024
Suggested? You sure it
was just a suggestion?

320
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,191
You know, it's funny how
different things look...

321
00:30:41,268 --> 00:30:44,066
Depending on where you sit, right?

322
00:30:44,438 --> 00:30:46,702
I look at this as a
favour for you, Pam...

323
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:50,038
Giving you an opportunity to
complete some unfinished business.

324
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,338
Meaning?

325
00:30:51,645 --> 00:30:55,103
Bourne. He's here.
He's a threat.

326
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:57,540
And we both want the same thing.

327
00:30:57,617 --> 00:31:00,177
But we both go about it
in two very different ways.

328
00:31:00,253 --> 00:31:02,778
The past is past, Pam.
All right?

329
00:31:03,924 --> 00:31:05,221
We were careless in Stockholm.

330
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:06,953
So what was Waterloo?
Just careless again?

331
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:10,394
We had a leak. A serious
national security situation.

332
00:31:10,464 --> 00:31:13,331
Bourne showed up on our surveillance
and we had very little time to react.

333
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,698
And a reporter got killed.

334
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:18,704
Bourne saw us coming.
The question is what was he doing there?

335
00:31:18,772 --> 00:31:20,205
No, the real question
is how you managed...

336
00:31:20,273 --> 00:31:22,764
To get into a firefight
at a public train station.

337
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:25,937
You know as well as I do decisions
made in real time are never perfect.

338
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:30,108
Don't second-guess an
operation from an armchair.

339
00:31:34,221 --> 00:31:36,348
I'll see you at the office.

340
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:38,623
Enjoy your egg whites.

341
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:00,112
People!

342
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,343
This is Pamela Landy and
her associate, Tom Cronin.

343
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:05,748
She's gonna be quarterbacking
the search effort.

344
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:07,309
Say your names.
State your specs, please.

345
00:32:07,387 --> 00:32:11,448
Well, let's do names later, okay?
What's Bourne's last fixed position?

346
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:12,992
London, 1200 Zulu.

347
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:15,084
Status. What is he?
Armed? Wounded?

348
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:17,891
Alive, mobile and unknown.

349
00:32:17,964 --> 00:32:19,454
Do we have an ECHELON package?
Yes.

350
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:21,592
Why isn't it on?
We were waiting.

351
00:32:21,668 --> 00:32:23,932
Waiting? For what?
What... Listen...

352
00:32:24,004 --> 00:32:27,030
People, do you have any
idea who you're dealing with?

353
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:28,267
This is Jason Bourne.

354
00:32:28,341 --> 00:32:31,833
You are nine hours behind the
toughest target you have ever tracked.

355
00:32:31,912 --> 00:32:36,315
Now, I want everyone to sit down,
strap in and turn on all you've got.

356
00:32:37,584 --> 00:32:39,279
That would mean now!

357
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:40,785
Thank you.

358
00:32:40,854 --> 00:32:42,287
Give me a team deployment plan.

359
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:45,483
I want everything you
got on Ross on screen one.

360
00:33:07,914 --> 00:33:09,472
Sir, I think we have something.

361
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:11,517
We just hacked Ross' e-mail
account at the Guardian.

362
00:33:11,585 --> 00:33:14,179
Found a round-trip ticket
to Turin, Italy, yesterday.

363
00:33:14,254 --> 00:33:16,882
0800 arrival, 1205 departure.

364
00:33:16,957 --> 00:33:20,484
I think we can be pretty certain
that Bourne's not your source, then.

365
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,618
How?

366
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:24,220
Ross's call to his editor where
he said he'd just met the source...

367
00:33:24,297 --> 00:33:27,323
Took place just after
his Turin flight landed.

368
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,561
He met his source in Turin.
So?

369
00:33:29,636 --> 00:33:32,161
What? So, what? Bourne met
Ross in Turin for breakfast...

370
00:33:32,238 --> 00:33:35,537
And then at noon the same day Bourne
calls Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo?

371
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:37,474
Maybe they were even on the same flight.

372
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:39,442
Pull up everything you've got.

373
00:33:39,512 --> 00:33:42,777
Cross-check the secure cell phone
usage of everyone with SCI clearance...

374
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:45,977
Against all calls going in and out of Turin, Italy,
the morning Ross was there.

375
00:33:46,052 --> 00:33:49,579
This guy you're after is a CIA operative
with clearance above top secret.

376
00:33:49,656 --> 00:33:52,386
He's committing treason
by talking to Ross.

377
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:53,483
Do you really think while doing that...

378
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,653
He's gonna use a cell phone
that he knows we can track?

379
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,424
Zero results on the cross-check.

380
00:33:57,497 --> 00:33:59,226
So, you got any better ideas?

381
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:01,460
Yeah, look at all the people whose
cell phones were switched off...

382
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:03,195
The entire period Ross was in Turin.

383
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:05,066
I mean, if your people are on
their phones as much as mine...

384
00:34:05,138 --> 00:34:07,504
The list should be pretty small.

385
00:34:12,078 --> 00:34:15,775
Three names. Tom Brewster,
Jack Boulin and Neal Daniels.

386
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:18,682
Okay, now check everything in
Ross' apartment against those names.

387
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,413
Check for common patterns.

388
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:22,921
Look for anything that
indicates who Ross met.

389
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:25,287
Pull up his socials.
Pull it up.

390
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:26,757
See those documents?

391
00:34:26,826 --> 00:34:28,384
Break it.

392
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:30,155
Over here. What is that?

393
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:34,094
All right. Right there.
Initials.

394
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,897
Pull that up.
Bring that up on main.

395
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:42,397
Neal Daniels.

396
00:34:42,475 --> 00:34:44,306
He's station chief in Madrid, isn't he?

397
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:45,605
Yeah.

398
00:34:49,516 --> 00:34:51,381
All right, call the RSO at the embassy.

399
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:53,817
Have them take Daniels into custody,
if he is there.

400
00:34:53,887 --> 00:34:56,754
Anna, get grab teams to
the Calle Norte safe house.

401
00:34:56,823 --> 00:34:59,348
Send them in heavy.
Tell them we'll assist with the entry.

402
00:34:59,426 --> 00:35:01,519
Heavy? Daniels isn't
really that much of a...

403
00:35:01,594 --> 00:35:02,959
I'm worried about Bourne.

404
00:35:03,029 --> 00:35:04,519
If he is not the source...

405
00:35:04,597 --> 00:35:07,065
Then he is after the source,
the same as we are.

406
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,367
ETA, Team Two.

407
00:35:42,435 --> 00:35:43,925
Three minutes to destination, sir.

408
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:11,754
Your mission will save American lives.

409
00:36:16,169 --> 00:36:19,764
Really give yourself to this program.

410
00:36:20,573 --> 00:36:21,767
I can't.

411
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,436
You can.

412
00:37:01,447 --> 00:37:03,813
Sir, they're at the front door.

413
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:24,202
Five seconds.
Put it up live.

414
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:34,143
We're in.

415
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:39,548
The alarm's down.

416
00:37:40,186 --> 00:37:41,676
That's gotta be Bourne.

417
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:56,761
The safe is empty.
Shit.

418
00:37:56,836 --> 00:37:58,633
Looks like he left in a hurry.

419
00:37:58,705 --> 00:38:00,036
Track Daniels' passports.

420
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:01,368
Stand by.

421
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:34,801
Hammond.

422
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:01,229
God damn it!
Get a backup team in there!

423
00:39:12,812 --> 00:39:15,906
Get me a secure line in there.
Get the second team over there now!

424
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:28,016
What are you doing here?

425
00:39:29,462 --> 00:39:31,794
I was posted here after Berlin.

426
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,628
Where's Daniels?

427
00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:40,538
Where is he?

428
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,319
Hello?

429
00:40:05,398 --> 00:40:06,592
Who is this?

430
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,600
This is Nicky Parsons.

431
00:40:11,371 --> 00:40:13,339
She was Treadstone.
Logistics.

432
00:40:13,406 --> 00:40:16,569
She was with us when we
hunted Bourne in Berlin.

433
00:40:20,747 --> 00:40:22,977
Nicky, I need to do an ID challenge.

434
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:24,744
Code in, Sparrow.

435
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:36,086
Response, Everest.

436
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:45,331
Nicky, this is Noah Vosen.
How long have you been on-site?

437
00:40:45,405 --> 00:40:47,066
I just walked in.

438
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:51,872
We have two officers on-site.
Are you in contact with them?

439
00:40:55,214 --> 00:40:58,513
They're down.
Unconscious but alive.

440
00:41:02,722 --> 00:41:04,485
Any sign of Neal Daniels?

441
00:41:04,557 --> 00:41:05,615
No.

442
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:08,419
Nicky, this is Pam Landy.

443
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:11,230
We have reason to believe
there's a connection between...

444
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:13,595
Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne.

445
00:41:15,268 --> 00:41:19,261
Bourne? You're still looking for Bourne?
I thought that case was closed.

446
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:22,171
No, some people are
convinced he's still a threat.

447
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:24,709
I disagree, but to find
out I need to talk to him.

448
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:26,369
Hold on, Nicky.

449
00:41:28,114 --> 00:41:30,207
What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to send him a message.

450
00:41:30,283 --> 00:41:32,649
You don't think Bourne is a threat?
He just took out two more of my men.

451
00:41:32,718 --> 00:41:34,310
The only way this has
a happy ending, Noah...

452
00:41:34,387 --> 00:41:35,615
Is if we bring him in alive.

453
00:41:35,688 --> 00:41:37,622
He is going after Daniels.

454
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,419
He wants revenge, Pam,
and the only realistic way...

455
00:41:39,492 --> 00:41:41,517
To end this is to eliminate the threat.

456
00:41:41,594 --> 00:41:43,494
How long until backup?

457
00:41:44,831 --> 00:41:47,459
Nicky, I need you to stay
put and secure the premises.

458
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:51,435
Backup will be arriving in approximately one hour.
Do you copy?

459
00:41:54,407 --> 00:41:55,738
Copy, sir.

460
00:42:00,713 --> 00:42:01,975
How long do I have?

461
00:42:02,048 --> 00:42:03,140
Three minutes.

462
00:42:05,718 --> 00:42:07,379
My car's outside.

463
00:42:08,921 --> 00:42:10,912
I know where Daniels is.

464
00:42:29,742 --> 00:42:31,209
Come on.

465
00:42:31,911 --> 00:42:33,208
Two minutes
to destination, sir.

466
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:34,405
Grab Teams A and B...

467
00:42:35,148 --> 00:42:36,274
Where was Daniels headed?

468
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:40,718
At 8:00 this morning,
he wired $100,000 to a bank account in Tangier.

469
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:45,355
Right, that's 300 miles away.
If we hurry, we can make the morning ferry.

470
00:42:46,492 --> 00:42:47,481
Where are you parked?

471
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,825
To the right, 20 metres,
north side of the street.

472
00:42:56,469 --> 00:42:57,561
They're coming.

473
00:42:57,637 --> 00:42:58,729
Keep moving.

474
00:43:00,006 --> 00:43:02,634
Two subjects seen exiting safe house.

475
00:43:14,687 --> 00:43:15,711
What the hell is this?

476
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:18,548
Wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no!

477
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:26,994
What the hell just happened?

478
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:28,727
We've lost visual contact
with the subjects, sir.

479
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:29,790
Christ!

480
00:43:32,371 --> 00:43:36,535
Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne,
effective immediately.

481
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:40,007
Send out a system one alert
to all Spanish contacts.

482
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,209
I want all air and ground
border exits locked down.

483
00:44:05,638 --> 00:44:07,265
What's going on?

484
00:44:09,008 --> 00:44:10,839
What's Daniels got?

485
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:14,572
What's Operation Blackbriar?

486
00:44:16,616 --> 00:44:20,382
Do you want to tell me,
or should I call Kramer and ask him?

487
00:44:24,123 --> 00:44:26,216
For Christ's sake, Pam,
we're in the middle of an operation.

488
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:27,589
Bullshit.

489
00:44:28,828 --> 00:44:30,819
You want Jason Bourne...

490
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:33,254
Level with me.

491
00:44:41,307 --> 00:44:45,141
Operation Blackbriar started
as an NEAT surveillance program.

492
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:46,405
And what is it now?

493
00:44:46,479 --> 00:44:49,812
It is now the umbrella
program for all our black ops.

494
00:44:49,882 --> 00:44:53,648
Full envelope intrusion, rendition,
experimental interrogation...

495
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:56,017
Is all run out of this office.

496
00:44:57,957 --> 00:45:01,085
We are the sharp end
of the stick now, Pam.

497
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,684
Lethal action?

498
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:05,460
If we have to, sure.

499
00:45:06,766 --> 00:45:10,202
That's what makes us special.
No more red tape.

500
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,263
No more getting the bad
guys caught in our sights...

501
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:14,601
Then watching them escape...

502
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:16,835
While we wait for someone in
Washington to issue the order.

503
00:45:18,344 --> 00:45:19,777
Oh, come on.

504
00:45:21,514 --> 00:45:25,075
You've seen the raw intel, Pam.
You know how real the danger is.

505
00:45:25,151 --> 00:45:27,676
We need these programs now.

506
00:45:27,753 --> 00:45:29,721
What's the connection to Daniels?

507
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:33,486
He ran all of our operations in
Southern Europe and North Africa...

508
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:34,992
So he has everything.

509
00:45:35,061 --> 00:45:38,758
Names, dates, ghost sites,
who's cooperating with us abroad.

510
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:40,696
Every operation.

511
00:45:40,766 --> 00:45:43,599
You want that stuff in Bourne's hands,
out on the market to the highest bidder?

512
00:45:43,669 --> 00:45:45,330
I don't think so.

513
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:50,902
Bourne's not after money.
He's after Daniels for a reason.

514
00:45:51,711 --> 00:45:54,305
Well, what does it matter
what Bourne is after?

515
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,781
When we find Daniels, and,
believe me, we'll find him...

516
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,545
If you're right...

517
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:02,119
We get Bourne, too.

518
00:46:30,783 --> 00:46:32,683
Why did you come back?

519
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,286
Why are you looking for Daniels?

520
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:48,957
Do you know who that is?

521
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:51,927
That's Daniels.

522
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,399
I don't know who that is.
Who is he?

523
00:47:02,081 --> 00:47:04,345
He was there at the beginning.

524
00:47:05,451 --> 00:47:07,476
I remember meeting him.

525
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:11,547
The first day.

526
00:47:11,624 --> 00:47:13,683
Daniels brought me to him.

527
00:47:16,362 --> 00:47:18,694
That's where it all started for me.

528
00:47:19,398 --> 00:47:23,300
Something happened to me and
I need to know what it was...

529
00:47:25,404 --> 00:47:27,872
Or I'll never be free of this.

530
00:47:28,741 --> 00:47:31,642
Daniels said the
training was experimental.

531
00:47:34,447 --> 00:47:36,381
Behaviour modification.

532
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:41,113
They had to break down the agents
before they became operational.

533
00:47:42,855 --> 00:47:45,187
He said you were the first one.

534
00:47:48,294 --> 00:47:50,285
Why are you helping me?

535
00:48:01,106 --> 00:48:03,165
It was difficult for me...

536
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:06,074
With you.

537
00:48:21,927 --> 00:48:24,452
You really don't remember anything.

538
00:48:28,434 --> 00:48:29,492
No.

539
00:48:38,177 --> 00:48:39,804
We have to move.

540
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:52,720
Sir? Mr. Wills?
You're gonna want to look at this.

541
00:49:03,502 --> 00:49:05,163
He's in Tangier.

542
00:49:12,111 --> 00:49:13,544
Noah Vosen.

543
00:49:22,955 --> 00:49:24,855
We have found Daniels.

544
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:32,261
They've just tracked Daniels'
passport to a hotel in Tangier.

545
00:49:32,331 --> 00:49:34,231
They're holding up a bank transfer
he made to keep him in place...

546
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,996
While they bring an
asset up from Casablanca.

547
00:49:37,069 --> 00:49:38,559
They're gonna take him out.

548
00:49:46,879 --> 00:49:47,868
Yeah.

549
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:49,972
It's Pam Landy.
She says it's urgent.

550
00:49:51,784 --> 00:49:53,217
Tell her I'm unavailable.

551
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:54,309
Yes, sir.

552
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:51,340
Sir, asset has arrived at the airport.

553
00:51:13,565 --> 00:51:16,033
Give me the subject's location.

554
00:51:16,101 --> 00:51:19,366
Subject is now on foot and
entering Hotel Velasquez.

555
00:51:19,438 --> 00:51:21,497
Hotel is 2.2 kilometres from the bank.

556
00:51:23,342 --> 00:51:26,539
All right, get an elevation
and a floor plan, tic-tac-toe.

557
00:51:26,612 --> 00:51:27,738
Locate the room.

558
00:51:27,813 --> 00:51:29,246
Give the asset subject location...

559
00:51:29,314 --> 00:51:31,248
And the route between the
subject's hotel and the bank.

560
00:51:47,966 --> 00:51:48,990
Do we have that room yet?

561
00:51:49,068 --> 00:51:51,298
Yes, sir. It's room 117.

562
00:51:51,904 --> 00:51:54,270
All right, get a hold
of the hotel trunk line.

563
00:51:54,339 --> 00:51:57,934
Run all calls through here
with an ISO on room 117.

564
00:52:11,557 --> 00:52:13,821
His location's being
blocked by the firewall.

565
00:52:13,892 --> 00:52:16,326
No, they found Daniels.
They know where he is.

566
00:52:16,395 --> 00:52:18,226
They'll get one of the
operatives to terminate him.

567
00:52:18,297 --> 00:52:19,787
Find out who.

568
00:52:23,669 --> 00:52:24,795
Desh.

569
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:30,574
Tell him you're gonna meet him
and you have a new phone for him.

570
00:52:30,642 --> 00:52:32,803
If you stop Desh,
they'll just get someone else.

571
00:52:32,878 --> 00:52:34,869
No, we're not gonna stop him,
we're gonna follow him.

572
00:52:34,947 --> 00:52:36,209
He'll take us right to Daniels.

573
00:53:14,419 --> 00:53:17,149
Sir, the asset is deviating off course.

574
00:53:19,558 --> 00:53:20,991
Let it play.

575
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:55,292
Asset unscheduled stop.

576
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:28,825
Sir, asset is on the
move en route to subject.

577
00:54:28,894 --> 00:54:31,055
Sir, we have an unauthorised breach.

578
00:54:31,129 --> 00:54:34,326
Someone with active system
knowledge penetrated our protocol.

579
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:38,267
Instructions were sent to
the asset at 1411 local time.

580
00:54:38,337 --> 00:54:40,032
Trace is confirmed and valid.

581
00:54:40,105 --> 00:54:43,404
It came from a computer
belonging to Nicky Parsons.

582
00:54:46,979 --> 00:54:48,844
Where did the course deviation occur?

583
00:54:48,914 --> 00:54:51,508
South to Rue de Belgique,
stationary Place de France.

584
00:54:52,684 --> 00:54:54,743
That's where Parsons is.

585
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:57,050
When we're finished with Daniels,
send the asset after her.

586
00:54:57,122 --> 00:54:58,111
Yes, sir.

587
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,420
We find Parsons,
we find Bourne.

588
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:02,517
Noah, what are you doing?

589
00:55:02,895 --> 00:55:04,487
Not now.
I wanna know what's going on.

590
00:55:04,563 --> 00:55:05,928
I said not now!

591
00:55:05,998 --> 00:55:08,296
What basis are you
continuing this operation on?

592
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:11,200
On the basis that Nicky Parsons
has compromised a covert operation.

593
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:12,464
She is up to her neck in this!

594
00:55:12,537 --> 00:55:14,198
This is about Daniels, not Nicky!

595
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:15,467
She has betrayed us.

596
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,132
You don't know the circumstances, Noah.

597
00:55:17,209 --> 00:55:19,006
She's in league with Jason Bourne,
for Christ's sakes!

598
00:55:19,077 --> 00:55:21,944
You do not have the
authority to kill her!

599
00:55:22,014 --> 00:55:25,108
Oh, yes, I do. And you
had better get on board.

600
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,151
Noah, she's one of us.

601
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:30,188
You start down this path,
where does it end?

602
00:55:30,822 --> 00:55:32,790
It ends when we've won.

603
00:55:46,204 --> 00:55:49,139
When we're finished with Daniels,
send the asset after them.

604
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:50,367
Yes, sir.

605
00:55:50,442 --> 00:55:52,501
Okay, come on.
Stand by...

606
00:56:12,965 --> 00:56:14,398
Two minutes, sir.
Two minutes.

607
00:56:14,466 --> 00:56:17,196
Tell the bank to release the funds.

608
00:56:32,517 --> 00:56:33,677
Hello?

609
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,521
He's on the move.

610
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:22,658
On it, sir.

611
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:23,894
Two hundred metres.

612
00:57:23,969 --> 00:57:25,766
Okay, come on, I want to lay
in some preliminary tracking.

613
00:57:36,014 --> 00:57:37,208
Stop!

614
01:09:19,268 --> 01:09:21,600
Code it in.
We need to be dead.

615
01:09:29,411 --> 01:09:32,278
Sir? Asset confirms
both targets are down.

616
01:09:42,858 --> 01:09:44,382
I want to be sure about this.

617
01:09:44,459 --> 01:09:46,552
Ask the station chief from
Rabat to confirm the deaths...

618
01:09:46,628 --> 01:09:48,357
And do a sub-rosa
collection of the bodies.

619
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:50,421
I want to tie this thing off completely.

620
01:09:50,499 --> 01:09:52,558
And keep an eye on Landy.

621
01:10:02,644 --> 01:10:03,668
Yeah?

622
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:05,406
Bourne and Nicky Parsons are dead.

623
01:10:05,981 --> 01:10:07,312
You sure about that?

624
01:10:07,382 --> 01:10:10,249
Our station chief in
Rabat is confirming.

625
01:10:11,687 --> 01:10:14,155
I can't afford to have
this come back to me.

626
01:10:15,123 --> 01:10:17,387
Don't worry.
You're protected.

627
01:10:17,793 --> 01:10:20,455
Just remember why we put Landy there.

628
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:23,521
If Blackbriar goes south...

629
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:26,568
We'll roll it up, hang it
around her neck and start over.

630
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:36,903
I can see their faces.

631
01:11:42,878 --> 01:11:44,937
Everyone I ever killed.

632
01:11:47,449 --> 01:11:49,713
I just don't know their names.

633
01:12:05,434 --> 01:12:07,368
Marie used to try to...

634
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:12,133
Help me remember the names.

635
01:12:24,619 --> 01:12:26,849
I've tried to apologise for...

636
01:12:27,856 --> 01:12:29,619
For what I've done.

637
01:12:33,395 --> 01:12:34,919
For what I am.

638
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:40,165
None of it makes it any better.

639
01:12:56,318 --> 01:12:58,752
They're gonna come for you again.

640
01:13:03,759 --> 01:13:05,989
You're gonna have to run now.

641
01:14:29,911 --> 01:14:31,401
We should go.

642
01:15:00,275 --> 01:15:01,833
It gets easier.

643
01:16:03,838 --> 01:16:06,329
Station chief in Rabat just called.

644
01:16:06,408 --> 01:16:08,103
They found a body.

645
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:12,170
Bourne?
Desh.

646
01:16:19,487 --> 01:16:21,546
Pam. You need to see this.

647
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:31,997
A passport for Gilberto de Piento
just cleared immigration.

648
01:16:32,067 --> 01:16:35,468
It's an early Treadstone identity
registered to Jason Bourne...

649
01:16:35,537 --> 01:16:38,631
But he never used it,
and it never went to the grid.

650
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:40,265
Bourne's alive.

651
01:16:47,882 --> 01:16:48,906
They don't know?

652
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:51,976
Well, if they knew,
Vosen wouldn't be in his office right now.

653
01:16:52,053 --> 01:16:53,520
It's a hell of a risk.

654
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:57,291
Maybe Bourne wants us to know.

655
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:00,726
Just like Naples.
Maybe he's communicating.

656
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:03,955
Maybe he's trying to
communicate with you.

657
01:17:04,032 --> 01:17:06,398
Then we should communicate back.

658
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:09,360
I think I know what
Bourne's looking for.

659
01:17:17,779 --> 01:17:20,646
Gilberto de Piento.
Gilberto de Piento.

660
01:17:20,715 --> 01:17:23,013
Your party is waiting for you.

661
01:18:55,377 --> 01:18:56,867
Pamela Landy.

662
01:18:56,945 --> 01:18:58,879
I hear you're still looking for me.

663
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:03,510
Bourne?

664
01:19:03,585 --> 01:19:05,246
What do you want?

665
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:09,814
Yeah?

666
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:12,155
Better get in here.
We got a situation.

667
01:19:12,994 --> 01:19:14,120
I...

668
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:18,426
I wanted to thank you for the tape.

669
01:19:19,734 --> 01:19:22,794
It's all tied off. It's over.

670
01:19:22,871 --> 01:19:25,101
I guess I owe you an apology.

671
01:19:26,408 --> 01:19:28,205
Is that official?

672
01:19:28,276 --> 01:19:31,143
No. Off the record.
You know how it is.

673
01:19:31,212 --> 01:19:32,201
You tracing this?

674
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,770
Fifty seconds to trace.

675
01:19:33,848 --> 01:19:35,748
Goodbye.
Wait. Wait.

676
01:19:38,586 --> 01:19:41,020
David Webb.
That's your real name.

677
01:19:43,024 --> 01:19:46,858
You were born 4/15/71 in Nixa, Missouri.

678
01:19:47,629 --> 01:19:50,655
Why don't you come in and we'll talk about it?

679
01:19:51,533 --> 01:19:53,763
Something is very wrong here.

680
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:57,401
Bourne?

681
01:19:59,441 --> 01:20:00,908
Get some rest, Pam.

682
01:20:00,975 --> 01:20:02,567
You look tired.

683
01:20:04,879 --> 01:20:06,938
He's looking right at her.

684
01:20:09,951 --> 01:20:11,043
People, listen up!

685
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:13,019
This is a national security emergency.

686
01:20:13,087 --> 01:20:15,055
We have an imminent threat.

687
01:20:15,123 --> 01:20:16,784
I'm going out there.

688
01:20:16,858 --> 01:20:19,224
If I show myself, he'll find me.

689
01:20:19,294 --> 01:20:22,161
Jason Bourne is alive and is
at large in New York City...

690
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:24,630
And, we believe,
within 1,000 yards of this building.

691
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:27,361
I want an immediate 12-block
lockdown of the area.

692
01:20:27,435 --> 01:20:28,993
Send a flash message to Langley.

693
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:31,402
Prep for local backup assistance.

694
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:34,974
Landy just left the building!

695
01:20:35,043 --> 01:20:36,476
Stay with her phone.

696
01:20:53,394 --> 01:20:56,522
She's using her cell.
There's an incoming text.

697
01:20:56,598 --> 01:20:57,826
Get it.
Working on it, sir.

698
01:20:57,899 --> 01:20:58,991
How many do we have on Landy?

699
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:00,227
Six men. More on the way.

700
01:21:00,301 --> 01:21:03,532
I've got it, sir!
Coming up on the screen now.

701
01:21:07,275 --> 01:21:10,540
Anybody not on Landy goes
directly to Tudor City.

702
01:21:10,612 --> 01:21:13,080
Get the vehicles.
We're going mobile.

703
01:21:14,883 --> 01:21:16,145
Team Two. Team Two.
All teams, call in.

704
01:21:52,353 --> 01:21:53,911
178th.

705
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:00,088
There's only one way out of there.
Why would he do that?

706
01:22:00,161 --> 01:22:01,458
He's trapping himself.

707
01:22:01,529 --> 01:22:03,292
It's a bad place to meet.
It's too exposed.

708
01:22:03,364 --> 01:22:05,298
He wouldn't have chosen it
if he didn't have a reason.

709
01:22:11,306 --> 01:22:13,399
Subject is en route.

710
01:22:13,474 --> 01:22:15,408
Roof 43, let me know
when you have visual.

711
01:22:15,476 --> 01:22:17,273
Roof 43, standing by.

712
01:22:23,985 --> 01:22:25,009
Standing by.

713
01:22:25,086 --> 01:22:28,453
Okay, folks, here we go.
Box 200 metres.

714
01:22:28,523 --> 01:22:29,854
Visual on leader.

715
01:22:29,924 --> 01:22:32,256
43 ground in position.

716
01:22:32,727 --> 01:22:35,457
As soon as you have eyes on Landy,
I wanna know.

717
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:51,171
Okay, here we go.

718
01:22:51,245 --> 01:22:53,076
Copy that. I see her.

719
01:23:05,159 --> 01:23:07,127
Any sign of Bourne?

720
01:23:07,195 --> 01:23:08,457
Negative.

721
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:11,259
No sign of target.

722
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:24,009
Noah Vosen.

723
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:26,569
This is Jason Bourne.

724
01:23:27,882 --> 01:23:30,578
I was wondering when you
were going to make this call.

725
01:23:30,652 --> 01:23:32,210
How did you get this number?

726
01:23:32,286 --> 01:23:36,188
You didn't actually think I was
coming to Tudor City, did you?

727
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,683
No, I guess not.

728
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:41,626
But if it's me you want to talk to...

729
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:44,164
Perhaps we can arrange a meet.

730
01:23:44,232 --> 01:23:45,995
Where are you now?

731
01:23:46,868 --> 01:23:48,927
I'm sitting in my office.

732
01:23:50,304 --> 01:23:51,794
I doubt that.

733
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:54,171
And why would you doubt that?

734
01:23:54,242 --> 01:23:55,641
If you were in your office right now...

735
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:58,770
We'd be having this
conversation face to face.

736
01:24:05,787 --> 01:24:07,186
Noah Vosen.

737
01:24:10,224 --> 01:24:11,953
This is a code ten abort.

738
01:24:12,026 --> 01:24:14,494
I want everyone back in the vehicles.
This is a code ten abort.

739
01:24:14,562 --> 01:24:16,325
Let's go! Let's go!

740
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:39,878
Yeah?

741
01:24:39,954 --> 01:24:41,251
Wills, check my office.

742
01:24:45,993 --> 01:24:46,982
Damn it!

743
01:24:47,061 --> 01:24:48,688
What's going on?

744
01:24:51,699 --> 01:24:54,167
We need building security up here.

745
01:24:55,436 --> 01:24:57,301
He's got everything.
God damn it!

746
01:24:57,371 --> 01:24:59,464
All right, set a four-block
perimeter around the building.

747
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:00,837
Somebody give me a visual.

748
01:25:00,908 --> 01:25:02,307
I want the entire building searched.

749
01:25:02,376 --> 01:25:05,709
Every room, every hallway,
every closet, every goddamn air duct.

750
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:07,771
You understand?
I want him found!

751
01:25:11,419 --> 01:25:12,681
What just happened?

752
01:25:12,754 --> 01:25:16,246
Bourne just broke into CRI.
He got into Vosen's safe.

753
01:25:18,226 --> 01:25:19,420
Where to?

754
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:21,826
415 East 71st Street.

755
01:25:22,663 --> 01:25:25,689
Four-fifteen-seventy-one?
Jesus, Pam.

756
01:25:51,259 --> 01:25:52,920
Target in sight.

757
01:25:57,698 --> 01:25:59,290
North on Eighth.

758
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:07,830
He's headed east in the Port Authority.

759
01:26:07,909 --> 01:26:09,877
All agents have shoot-on-sight authorisation.

760
01:26:34,635 --> 01:26:36,068
Right there!

761
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,313
Sir, he drove off the roof.
What?

762
01:27:20,381 --> 01:27:22,281
He drove off the roof!

763
01:27:23,718 --> 01:27:25,845
He's on foot.
He's running.

764
01:27:36,497 --> 01:27:37,725
Police! Freeze!

765
01:27:37,798 --> 01:27:39,561
Put your hands in the air!

766
01:27:49,176 --> 01:27:50,803
Call for backup!

767
01:28:15,336 --> 01:28:18,066
Sir, sir, take a look at this!
Bourne's birthday, sir.

768
01:28:18,139 --> 01:28:19,470
What about it?
Check that out.

769
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:23,909
Sir, Landy told Bourne that
his birthday was 4-15-71.

770
01:28:24,645 --> 01:28:26,613
Oh, my God. It's a code.

771
01:28:27,248 --> 01:28:29,876
Everything stops.
Everything stops! Listen up!

772
01:28:29,951 --> 01:28:32,784
4-15-71.
New assignment, numbers.

773
01:28:32,853 --> 01:28:34,718
What does it mean?
Give me encryption codes!

774
01:28:34,789 --> 01:28:37,349
Sir, if you plug them in as
variables of longitude and latitude...

775
01:28:37,425 --> 01:28:39,188
You get Cameroon.

776
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:42,229
41571 is the zip code
for Varney, Kentucky.

777
01:28:45,132 --> 01:28:46,326
What date did she give him?

778
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,028
4/15/71.

779
01:28:49,103 --> 01:28:50,866
I don't believe it.

780
01:28:51,405 --> 01:28:55,068
SRD is at 415 East 71st Street.

781
01:28:55,142 --> 01:28:56,871
She just gave him the training facility.

782
01:28:56,944 --> 01:28:58,070
Oh, Christ.

783
01:28:58,145 --> 01:29:00,579
Bring all the teams in behind us.

784
01:30:59,033 --> 01:31:00,728
Hurry up!
Somebody call 911!

785
01:31:00,801 --> 01:31:01,825
Help him!

786
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:38,730
The asset lost Bourne.
We lost him.

787
01:31:46,881 --> 01:31:49,008
Hello?
Albert, it's Vosen.

788
01:31:50,251 --> 01:31:53,948
Bourne knows everything and
he's on his way to you right now.

789
01:31:54,488 --> 01:31:56,718
He's coming home, Noah.

790
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:58,621
How long do I have?

791
01:31:58,692 --> 01:31:59,920
I don't know.

792
01:31:59,994 --> 01:32:02,326
Just get the hell out of there.

793
01:32:02,429 --> 01:32:04,397
No, I'm gonna stay.

794
01:32:04,465 --> 01:32:07,992
He'll head for the training wing.
That's what he knows.

795
01:32:08,269 --> 01:32:12,103
I'll keep him in play
till you get there.

796
01:33:03,290 --> 01:33:05,315
They'll kill you for giving me this.

797
01:33:05,392 --> 01:33:08,293
4-15-71 isn't much of a code.

798
01:33:08,362 --> 01:33:11,126
My guess is Vosen is on his way already.

799
01:33:12,066 --> 01:33:13,897
Why'd you do it?

800
01:33:13,968 --> 01:33:16,095
Because this isn't
what I signed up for...

801
01:33:16,170 --> 01:33:18,468
What they did to you, Blackbriar.

802
01:33:18,906 --> 01:33:20,430
This isn't us.

803
01:33:22,443 --> 01:33:26,174
Then do something about it.
Everything you need is in there.

804
01:33:30,417 --> 01:33:31,816
Everything.

805
01:33:33,187 --> 01:33:36,452
David. Why don't you come in with me?

806
01:33:36,523 --> 01:33:38,013
It'll be better if we do this together.

807
01:33:38,092 --> 01:33:39,491
No.

808
01:33:41,395 --> 01:33:43,693
This is where it started for me.

809
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,929
This is where it ends.

810
01:33:59,079 --> 01:34:00,569
That's Landy.

811
01:34:06,887 --> 01:34:09,720
Mandy Aaron, dial extension 200, please.

812
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:12,384
Mandy Aaron, dial extension 200.

813
01:34:12,993 --> 01:34:14,460
All right, lock this building down.

814
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:17,053
Set a secure perimeter of one block.

815
01:34:23,370 --> 01:34:26,828
Hello. This is Pamela Landy.
I have to send a classified document.

816
01:34:26,907 --> 01:34:28,738
Get a team to SRD after Bourne.

817
01:34:28,809 --> 01:34:30,606
And put someone in every
public area of this hospital.

818
01:34:30,678 --> 01:34:33,704
Okay. Elevator shafts,
service entrances, go!

819
01:34:39,019 --> 01:34:41,647
Damn it! South bay! Go!

820
01:34:42,156 --> 01:34:44,021
Gentlemen, this is a
priority one situation!

821
01:34:44,091 --> 01:34:45,490
You will give us your full cooperation.

822
01:34:45,559 --> 01:34:47,720
Give me playback for the entire
building for the last three minutes.

823
01:34:47,795 --> 01:34:48,819
Yes, sir.

824
01:35:00,607 --> 01:35:02,040
Move! Move!

825
01:35:07,715 --> 01:35:09,808
This one, here!
Where is this?

826
01:35:09,883 --> 01:35:11,009
First floor.

827
01:35:11,085 --> 01:35:13,178
I'll take Landy on my own.

828
01:35:48,522 --> 01:35:51,218
You better get yourself a good lawyer.

829
01:36:05,105 --> 01:36:08,404
A republic lives on the knife's edge.

830
01:36:16,283 --> 01:36:20,276
When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.

831
01:36:22,723 --> 01:36:25,590
You may not even remember who he was.

832
01:36:28,162 --> 01:36:31,188
You know why we're
treating you like this?

833
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:33,924
Hello, Jason.

834
01:36:37,137 --> 01:36:40,368
I believe you've been
having some problems.

835
01:36:40,441 --> 01:36:42,102
Put the gun down.

836
01:36:43,177 --> 01:36:46,146
I wouldn't be here if
I didn't want to talk.

837
01:36:49,383 --> 01:36:51,715
I've spent three years running.

838
01:36:52,419 --> 01:36:55,616
Three years trying to find out who I am.

839
01:36:55,689 --> 01:36:58,624
You've still not got
it all back, have you?

840
01:36:59,293 --> 01:37:01,625
Still not filled in the pieces.

841
01:37:01,695 --> 01:37:03,356
It was always you.

842
01:37:05,432 --> 01:37:07,229
I'm unarmed, Jason.

843
01:37:07,734 --> 01:37:10,328
Why me? Why did you pick me?

844
01:37:11,638 --> 01:37:14,334
Your really don't remember, do you?

845
01:37:16,643 --> 01:37:19,669
We didn't pick you.
You picked us.

846
01:37:22,783 --> 01:37:24,444
You volunteered.

847
01:37:26,353 --> 01:37:27,752
Right here.

848
01:37:30,791 --> 01:37:32,315
Even after you were warned.

849
01:37:42,402 --> 01:37:44,233
Captain Webb.

850
01:37:44,304 --> 01:37:45,601
Good morning, Captain.

851
01:37:51,144 --> 01:37:53,169
You came in here.

852
01:37:55,249 --> 01:37:58,082
You didn't even blink, Jason.

853
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:05,249
You just handed me these.

854
01:38:12,065 --> 01:38:14,625
Has everything been explained to you?

855
01:38:16,403 --> 01:38:17,734
Yes, sir.

856
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:22,638
You said you wanted to serve.

857
01:38:24,344 --> 01:38:27,370
Your missions will save American lives.

858
01:38:27,447 --> 01:38:29,312
I understand, sir.

859
01:38:31,952 --> 01:38:34,614
You said I'd be saving American lives.

860
01:38:35,122 --> 01:38:36,817
You were.

861
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:39,051
I was killing for you.

862
01:38:41,261 --> 01:38:42,694
For them.

863
01:38:43,564 --> 01:38:48,228
You knew exactly what it meant
for you if you chose to stay.

864
01:38:48,502 --> 01:38:52,734
When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.

865
01:38:52,806 --> 01:38:55,036
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.

866
01:38:56,944 --> 01:38:59,572
You can't outrun what you did, Jason.

867
01:39:00,213 --> 01:39:02,807
You made yourself into who you are.

868
01:39:03,650 --> 01:39:06,619
Eventually you're gonna
have to face the fact...

869
01:39:06,687 --> 01:39:11,283
You chose right here
to become Jason Bourne.

870
01:39:17,798 --> 01:39:20,266
You haven't slept for a long time.

871
01:39:25,639 --> 01:39:27,732
Have you made a decision?

872
01:39:32,312 --> 01:39:34,007
This can't go on.

873
01:39:34,748 --> 01:39:36,545
You have to decide.

874
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:41,451
Who is he?

875
01:39:41,855 --> 01:39:43,584
We've been through that.

876
01:39:47,127 --> 01:39:48,719
What did he do?

877
01:39:49,296 --> 01:39:51,127
It doesn't matter.

878
01:40:04,978 --> 01:40:06,969
You came to us.

879
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:11,618
You volunteered.

880
01:40:12,452 --> 01:40:15,615
You said you'd do
anything it takes to...

881
01:40:16,289 --> 01:40:18,450
Save American lives.

882
01:40:19,092 --> 01:40:21,219
You're not a liar, are you?

883
01:40:22,262 --> 01:40:24,753
Or too weak...

884
01:40:25,632 --> 01:40:27,463
To see this through?

885
01:40:29,136 --> 01:40:30,626
This is it.

886
01:40:31,805 --> 01:40:34,603
Let go of David Webb.

887
01:40:40,313 --> 01:40:44,010
Really give yourself to this program.

888
01:41:09,309 --> 01:41:11,140
You're no longer...

889
01:41:12,145 --> 01:41:13,612
David Webb.

890
01:41:14,981 --> 01:41:19,145
From now on, you'll be
known as Jason Bourne.

891
01:41:20,887 --> 01:41:23,048
Welcome to the program.

892
01:41:36,236 --> 01:41:38,067
Do you remember now?

893
01:41:46,847 --> 01:41:48,337
I remember.

894
01:41:50,584 --> 01:41:52,484
I remember everything.

895
01:41:54,054 --> 01:41:56,215
I'm no longer Jason Bourne.

896
01:41:57,891 --> 01:42:00,155
So now you're gonna kill me.

897
01:42:01,428 --> 01:42:02,588
No.

898
01:42:04,331 --> 01:42:08,461
You don't deserve the star they'd
give you on the wall at Langley.

899
01:42:22,883 --> 01:42:24,942
He's headed for the roof!

900
01:43:10,096 --> 01:43:12,326
Why didn't you take the shot?

901
01:43:21,308 --> 01:43:24,436
Do you even know why
you're supposed to kill me?

902
01:43:33,854 --> 01:43:35,253
Look at us.

903
01:43:38,258 --> 01:43:40,624
Look at what they make you give.

904
01:44:31,778 --> 01:44:33,302
Good morning, senators.

905
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:38,374
If I may, I'd like to begin by
making a statement for the record.

906
01:44:41,154 --> 01:44:45,784
The file indicates that Ezra
Kramer authorised six illegal...

907
01:44:45,859 --> 01:44:46,917
The President convened...

908
01:44:46,993 --> 01:44:48,790
An emergency cabinet meeting today...

909
01:44:48,862 --> 01:44:50,261
To discuss the growing scandal...

910
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:53,094
Over an alleged government
assassination program...

911
01:44:53,166 --> 01:44:55,157
Code-named Blackbriar.

912
01:44:55,235 --> 01:44:58,295
CIA Director Ezra Kramer is
under criminal investigation...

913
01:44:58,471 --> 01:45:00,336
For authorising the program...

914
01:45:00,407 --> 01:45:04,343
Which in several cases may
have even targeted US citizens.

915
01:45:08,448 --> 01:45:11,144
Two agency officials have
already been arrested.

916
01:45:11,217 --> 01:45:14,983
Dr. Albert Hirsch, the alleged
mastermind of Blackbriar program...

917
01:45:15,055 --> 01:45:19,549
And CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen,
the program's operational chief.

918
01:45:23,029 --> 01:45:25,623
Meanwhile, mystery surrounds
the fate of David Webb...

919
01:45:25,699 --> 01:45:27,530
Also known as Jason Bourne,
the source...

920
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,364
Behind the exposure of
the Blackbriar program.

921
01:45:30,437 --> 01:45:33,873
It's been reported that Webb was shot
and fell from a Manhattan rooftop...

922
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:36,670
Into the East River ten stories below.

923
01:45:36,743 --> 01:45:38,711
However, after a three-day search...

924
01:45:38,778 --> 01:45:40,973
Webb's body has yet to be found.
