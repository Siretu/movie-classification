1
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,190
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,240
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,030
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

4
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,450
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,740
Stand by.

6
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,160
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,580
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,690
In form the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,860
Sir.

10
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,780
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honored.

11
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,200
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

12
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,820
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

13
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,990
I as sure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

14
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,540
Perhaps I can find
new ways to motivate them.

15
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,830
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.

16
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,920
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

17
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,260
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

18
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,510
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

19
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,270
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

20
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,150
and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.

21
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,730
We shall double our efforts.

22
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,150
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

23
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,160
The emperor is not
as forgiving as I am.

24
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,550
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

25
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,470
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

26
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,900
Don't be so sure.

27
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,320
If l told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

28
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
you'd probably short-circuit.

29
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,920
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?

30
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,130
I'd better knock, I suppose.

31
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,930
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

32
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,390
Goodness gracious me!

33
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,080
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.

34
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,800
We'd better go.

35
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,310
R2, wait.

36
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,350
Oh, dear. R2.

37
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,770
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

38
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,780
Oh, R2!

39
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,610
R2, wait for me!

40
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,330
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

41
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,420
Oh, my!

42
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,460
Oh, no.

43
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,930
Oh, my.

44
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,810
We bring a message
to your master, Jabba the Hutt.

45
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,820
And a gift.

46
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,280
What gift?

47
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:49,010
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

48
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

49
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,400
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

50
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,100
Good morning.

51
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,610
The message, R2.
The message.

52
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,330
Greetings, Exalted One.

53
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,790
Allow me to introduce myself.

54
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,800
I am Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.

55
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,220
I know that you are powerful,
mighty Jabba...

56
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,010
and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful.

57
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,970
I seek an audience with Your Greatness
to bargain for Solo's life.

58
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,360
With your wisdom, I'm sure
we can work out an arrangement...

59
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,190
which will be mutually beneficial...

60
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,990
and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation.

61
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,320
As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift

62
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,160
these two droids.

63
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,200
What did he say?

64
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,830
Both are hardworking
and will serve you well.

65
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,710
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

66
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,090
He's no Jedi.

67
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,560
There will be no bargain.

68
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,890
We're doomed.

69
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:13,980
I will not give up
my favorite decoration.

70
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,910
I like Captain Solo where he is.

71
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,740
R2, look. Captain Solo.

72
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,370
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

73
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,970
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

74
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,970
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.

75
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,480
How horrid!

76
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,930
Good. New acquisitions.

77
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,680
You are a protocol droid,
are you not?

78
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,720
I am C-3PO

79
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,600
Yes or no will do.

80
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,180
Well, yes.

81
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,850
How many languages do you speak?

82
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,570
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily

83
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,360
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

84
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,820
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

85
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,740
and disintegrated him.

86
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,410
Disintegrated?

87
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,170
Guard, this protocol droid
might be useful.

88
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,460
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

89
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,920
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

90
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,470
R2, don't leave me!

91
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,770
You're a feisty little one...

92
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,390
but you'll soon learn some respect.

93
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,810
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

94
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,610
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

95
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,640
Ah! Do that again!

96
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,220
I have come for the bounty
on this Wookiee.

97
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,590
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

98
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,890
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

99
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,490
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.

100
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,950
Yes?

101
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,170
The illustrious Jabba
bids you welcome...

102
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,880
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

103
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,960
I want 50,000. No less.

104
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,800
"50,000. No less."

105
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,440
What did I say?

106
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,450
The mighty Jabba asks why
he must pay 50,000.

107
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,750
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator.

108
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,550
This bounty hunter
is my kind of scum...

109
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,350
fearless and inventive.

110
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,610
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

111
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,910
and I do suggest you take it.

112
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,080
He agrees!

113
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,710
Just relax for a moment.

114
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,420
You're free of the carbonite.

115
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,010
You have hibernation sickness.

116
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,600
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

117
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,980
- Where am I?
- Jabba's palace.

118
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,900
Who are you?

119
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,410
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

120
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,910
I gotta get you out of here.

121
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,330
What's that?

122
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,000
I know that laugh.

123
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,260
Hey, Jabba.

124
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,220
Look, Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.

125
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,220
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

126
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,060
It's too late for that, Solo.

127
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,900
You may have been a good smuggler...

128
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,490
but now you're Bantha fodder.

129
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Look

130
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,450
Take him away.

131
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,330
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

132
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,920
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

133
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,050
Bring her to me.

134
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,350
We have powerful friends.

135
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,470
You're gonna regret this.

136
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,310
I'm sure.

137
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,150
I can't bear to watch.

138
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,160
Chewie?

139
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,960
Chewie, is that you?

140
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,510
Wait a minute.
I can't see, pal.

141
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,510
What's going on?

142
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,640
Luke? Luke's crazy.

143
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,310
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

144
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,980
A Jedi knight?

145
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,730
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

146
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,070
I'm all right, pal.

147
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,490
I'm all right.

148
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,470
I must speak with Jabba.

149
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,680
No bargain.

150
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,230
You will take me to Jabba now.

151
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,520
You serve your master well.

152
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,360
And you will be rewarded.

153
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,540
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.

154
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,920
Master.

155
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,210
Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight.

156
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,630
I told you not to admit him.

157
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,550
I must be allowed to speak.

158
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,390
He must be allowed to speak.

159
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,230
You weak-minded fool!

160
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,610
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

161
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,190
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

162
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:19,330
Your mind powers
will not work on me, boy.

163
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,620
Nevertheless...

164
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,710
I'm taking Captain Solo
and his friends.

165
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,670
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

166
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,760
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

167
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,100
Master Luke, you're standing on

168
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,810
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

169
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,520
I shall enjoy watching you die.

170
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,220
Oh, no! The rancor!

171
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,270
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

172
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,570
They will all suffer for this outrage.

173
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,500
Han.

174
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,250
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

175
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,800
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we do in'?

176
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,590
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

177
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,220
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

178
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,310
Oh, dear.

179
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,270
His High Exalted ness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

180
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,440
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.

181
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,190
Good. I hate long waits.

182
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,200
You will there fore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

183
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,660
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

184
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,080
nesting place
of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

185
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,410
Doesn't sound so bad.

186
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,420
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

187
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,630
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

188
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,340
On second thought,
let's pass on that.

189
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,010
You should have bargained, Jabba.

190
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,310
That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.

191
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,610
I think my eyes are getting better.

192
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,780
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

193
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,870
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

194
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,830
You're gonna die here,
you know. Convenient.

195
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,290
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

196
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,710
I've taken care of everything.

197
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,880
Great.

198
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:50,350
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

199
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,560
I'm terribly sorry.

200
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,640
R2, what are you doing here?

201
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,810
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

202
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,860
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

203
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,700
I wish I had your confidence.

204
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,220
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

205
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,430
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honorably.

206
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,940
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

207
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,070
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

208
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,620
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

209
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,370
he'll get no such pleasure from us!

210
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,290
Right?

211
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,630
This is your last chance.

212
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,880
Free us or die.

213
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,140
Move him into position.

214
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,580
Put him in.

215
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,480
Easy, Chewie.

216
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,910
Help!

217
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,880
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

218
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,430
Han, Chewie!

219
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,590
Lando.

220
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,020
Boba Fett?

221
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,480
Boba Fett? Where?

222
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,680
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

223
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,230
I'm trying!

224
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,790
Grab me, Chewie.
Grab it!

225
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,770
Grab it. Almost.
You almost got it.

226
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,490
Gently, now.

227
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,610
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

228
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,920
Chewie, give me the gun.

229
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,050
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

230
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,170
I can see a lot better.
Don't move.

231
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,840
A little higher!

232
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,010
Chewie, pull us up.

233
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,680
Up, Chewie. Up.

234
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,140
We gotta get out of here.

235
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,650
Not my eyes! R2, help!

236
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,690
Quickly, R2!

237
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,240
Beast!

238
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,490
Get the gun!

239
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,870
Point it at the deck.

240
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,920
Point it at the deck!

241
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,260
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly

242
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,970
Come on.

243
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,480
- Let's go. Don't for get the droids.
- We're on our way.

244
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,770
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

245
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,530
Hurry. The Alliance
should be assembled by now.

246
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,320
- I will.
- Luke, thanks.

247
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,700
Thanks for coming after me.
Now I owe you one.

248
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,830
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

249
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,510
I have a promise to keep...

250
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,590
to an old friend.

251
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,230
Rise, my friend.

252
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,200
The Death Star will be
completed on schedule.

253
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,490
You've done well, Lord Vader.

254
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:56,460
Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

255
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,380
Yes, my master.

256
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,760
Patience, my friend.

257
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,260
In time, he will seek you out.

258
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,760
When he does,
you must bring him before me.

259
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,220
He has grown strong.

260
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:19,980
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

261
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,900
As you wish.

262
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,490
Everything is proceeding
as I have fore seen.

263
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,850
That face you make

264
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,390
Look I so old to young eyes?

265
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,310
No, of course not.

266
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,150
I do.

267
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,240
Yes, I do.

268
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:14,080
Sick have I become.

269
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,160
Old and weak.

270
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,750
When 900 years old you reach...

271
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,710
Look as good you will not.

272
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,720
Soon will I rest.

273
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,970
Yes. Forever sleep.

274
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,230
Earned it I have.

275
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,060
Master Yoda, you can't die.

276
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,280
Strong am I with the Force...

277
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,360
but not that strong.

278
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:57,240
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

279
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,830
That is the way of things...

280
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,130
the way of the Force.

281
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,970
But I need your help.

282
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,260
I've come back
to complete the training.

283
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,510
No more training do you require.

284
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,730
Already know you
that which you need.

285
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,150
Then I am a Jedi.

286
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,740
Not yet.

287
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,820
One thing remains

288
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:41,330
Vader. You must confront Vader.

289
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,250
Then only then
a Jedi will you be.

290
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,130
And confront him you will.

291
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,220
Master Yoda...

292
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,390
is Darth Vader my father?

293
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,020
Rest I need.

294
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,610
Yes.

295
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,190
Rest.

296
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,240
Yoda, I must know.

297
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,750
Your father he is.

298
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,590
Told you, did he?

299
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,720
Yes.

300
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,800
Unexpected this is.

301
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,310
And unfortunate.

302
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,100
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

303
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,520
No.

304
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:53,650
Unfortunate that
you rushed to face him...

305
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,360
that incomplete
was your training...

306
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,910
that not ready
for the burden were you.

307
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,540
I'm sorry.

308
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:11,250
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

309
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,050
But beware.

310
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,720
Anger, fear, aggression...

311
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,520
the dark side are they.

312
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,940
Once you start down the dark path...

313
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,820
forever will it dominate your destiny.

314
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,870
Do not

315
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:49,460
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

316
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,960
or suffer your father's fate you will.

317
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,550
When gone am I...

318
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:04,430
the last of the Jedi will you be.

319
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,020
The Force runs strong in your family.

320
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:19,110
Pass on what you have learned.

321
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,670
There is...

322
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,540
another...

323
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,090
Skywalker.

324
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,360
I can't do it, R2.

325
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,660
I can't go on alone.

326
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,040
Yoda will always be with you.

327
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,250
Obi-Wan.

328
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,930
Why didn't you tell me?

329
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:08,930
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

330
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:14,560
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

331
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,610
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

332
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,230
When that happened...

333
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,530
the good man who was
your father was destroyed.

334
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:27,030
So what I told you was true...

335
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,950
from a certain point of view.

336
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,540
A certain point of view?

337
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,540
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

338
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,630
depend greatly
on our own point of view.

339
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,130
Anakin was a good friend.

340
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,630
When I first knew him...

341
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,970
your father was already a great pilot...

342
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:50,680
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

343
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:54,810
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

344
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:58,860
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

345
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,230
I was wrong.

346
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,070
There is still good in him.

347
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:06,150
He's more machine now than man...

348
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,070
twisted and evil.

349
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,040
I can't do it, Ben.

350
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,080
You cannot escape your destiny.

351
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,420
You must face Darth Vader again.

352
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,380
I can't kill my own father.

353
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,680
Then the emperor has already won.

354
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,970
You were our only hope.

355
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,390
Yoda spoke of another.

356
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,060
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

357
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,900
But I have no sister.

358
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,940
To protect you both
from the emperor...

359
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:47,700
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.

360
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,280
The emperor knew, as I did...

361
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:54,120
if Anakin were to have any off spring...

362
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,750
they would be a threat to him.

363
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:02,170
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

364
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:08,680
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

365
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,890
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

366
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,350
They do you credit...

367
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:18,600
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

368
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,710
Look at you. A general, huh?

369
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,960
Someone must have told them about
my maneuver at the Battle of Tanaab.

370
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,970
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

371
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:53,050
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

372
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,310
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

373
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,140
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

374
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,060
You're the respectable one, remember?

375
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,360
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

376
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:16,030
The data brought to us by the Bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location...

377
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,290
of the emperor's new battle station.

378
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:20,210
We also know
that the weapon systems...

379
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,580
of this Death Star
are not yet operational.

380
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:25,670
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

381
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,250
in a vain effort to engage us...

382
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,300
it is relatively unprotected.

383
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,470
But most important of all...

384
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,300
we've learned that
the emperor himself...

385
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:36,560
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

386
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,140
of the construction
of this Death Star.

387
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,440
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

388
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,360
Admiral Ackbar, please.

389
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,610
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

390
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:59,200
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

391
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,830
the Death Star does have
a strong defense mechanism.

392
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,420
It is protected by an energy shield...

393
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,170
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

394
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,560
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

395
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,900
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

396
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,940
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...

397
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,030
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

398
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,910
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

399
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,330
Good luck.

400
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,910
You're gonna need it.

401
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,750
General Madine.

402
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:47,750
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

403
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,090
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

404
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:56,970
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

405
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,350
Sounds dangerous.

406
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,810
Wonder who they found
to pull that off.

407
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,930
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

408
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,980
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

409
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:11,190
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wan na speak for you.

410
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:17,610
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

411
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,660
I'm with you too.

412
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,290
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

413
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:32,050
Hi, Han, Chewie.

414
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,630
"Exciting" is hardly the word
I would choose.

415
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:54,320
Look, I want you to take her.

416
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,990
I mean it. Take her.

417
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:59,530
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

418
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,990
All right, old buddy.

419
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,080
I know what she means to you.

420
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,920
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

421
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,670
All right?

422
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,090
Right.

423
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,550
I got your promise.
Not a scratch.

424
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,850
Would you get going, you pirate?

425
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,770
Good luck.

426
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,310
You too.

427
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,490
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

428
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,740
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

429
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,010
Hey, you awake?

430
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:01,590
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

431
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,140
Come on, General. Let's move.

432
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:09,600
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

433
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,900
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

434
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,280
Here we go again.

435
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,200
All right, hang on.

436
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,970
What is thy bidding, my master?

437
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,440
Send the fleet
to the far side of Endor.

438
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,990
There it will stay until called for.

439
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,450
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

440
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,580
It is of no concern.

441
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:12,620
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

442
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,540
Your work here is finished, my friend.

443
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:17,340
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

444
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,340
Yes, my master.

445
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,150
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

446
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,070
We have you on our screen now.
Please identify..

447
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:48,450
Shuttle Tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.

448
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,210
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.

449
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,050
Transmission commencing.

450
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:04,130
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

451
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,430
It'll work. It'll work.

452
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,970
Vader's on that ship.

453
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,930
Don't get jittery, Luke.

454
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,310
There are a lot of command ships.

455
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,940
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

456
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,650
I don't know. Fly casual.

457
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:30,780
Where is that shuttle going?

458
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,950
Shuttle Tydirium,
what is your cargo and destination?

459
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,000
Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon.

460
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,840
Do they have a code clearance?

461
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,920
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

462
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,010
I was about to clear them.

463
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:55,100
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

464
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,520
It's your imagination, kid.

465
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,360
Come on. Let's keep
a little optimism here.

466
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,990
Shall I hold them?

467
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:13,910
No. Leave them to me.

468
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,370
I will deal with them myself.

469
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,460
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

470
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,210
They're not going for it, Chewie.

471
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,090
Shuttle Tydirium...

472
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,640
deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately.

473
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,060
Follow your present course.

474
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,680
Okay. I told you
it was gonna work.

475
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:37,980
No problem.

476
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,430
I told you it was dangerous here.

477
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,320
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

478
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:35,450
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

479
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,580
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

480
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:43,380
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

481
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,880
Hey...

482
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,300
it's me.

483
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,910
Go for help! Go!

484
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,530
Great. Come on!

485
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,050
Over there! Two more of them.

486
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:36,390
I see them. Wait. Leia!

487
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:41,730
Hey, wait!

488
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,480
Quick, jam their comlink.
Center switch.

489
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,710
Move closer.

490
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:07,630
Get alongside that one.

491
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,170
Keep on that one.
I'll take these two.

492
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,890
General Solo, somebody's coming.

493
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,360
Where's Leia?

494
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:24,660
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

495
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:27,280
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

496
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,450
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

497
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,580
Come on, R2.
We'll need your scanners.

498
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:36,500
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

499
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,130
And you said it was pretty here.

500
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,780
Cut it out.

501
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:23,720
I'm not gonna hurt you.

502
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:34,430
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

503
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,730
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

504
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:41,730
Maybe you can help me.

505
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,700
Come on. Sit down.

506
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,820
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

507
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:53,040
All right.
You want something to eat?

508
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,250
That's right.

509
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,890
Come on.

510
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:29,530
Look. It's a hat.

511
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,620
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

512
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,670
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

513
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,470
What is it?

514
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:28,470
Freeze!

515
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,800
Come on. Get up.

516
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,020
- Get your ride. Take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

517
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:43,980
What the

518
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,580
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

519
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:48,500
I told you to remain
on the command ship.

520
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:54,970
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

521
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:58,220
Yes, I know.

522
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:02,020
My son is with them.

523
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:08,320
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

524
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:12,240
Strange that I have not.

525
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:19,080
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

526
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,950
They are clear, my master.

527
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:26,330
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

528
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:29,460
He will come to me?

529
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:34,090
I have foreseen it.

530
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:38,220
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

531
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:42,270
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

532
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,600
As you wish.

533
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,620
Master Luke.

534
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,050
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.

535
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,130
And I found this.

536
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:21,970
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

537
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:26,020
I hope she's all right.

538
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,150
What, Chewie?

539
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:36,650
What, Chewie?

540
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:51,040
I don't get it.
It's just a dead animal.

541
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:56,380
Chewie, wait! Don't!

542
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:02,350
Nice work.

543
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,970
Great, Chewie.

544
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,230
Great. Always thinking
with your stomach.

545
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,480
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

546
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:13,320
Han, can you reach my light saber?

547
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,900
Yeah. Sure.

548
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:24,540
R2, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

549
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,620
It's a very long drop!

550
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:12,500
Hey. Point that thing
someplace else.

551
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:18,170
Hey!

552
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,760
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

553
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:29,430
Chewie, give them your cross bow.

554
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,190
Oh, my head.

555
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,230
Oh, my goodness.

556
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,020
Do you understand
anything they're saying?

557
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,520
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

558
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:17,440
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms

559
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,190
What are you telling them?

560
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,490
"Hello," I think.

561
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,660
I could be mistaken
they're using a very primitive dialect

562
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:29,330
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

563
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:38,130
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

564
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:41,130
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

565
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,510
Proper?

566
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:46,260
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

567
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:47,640
Why, you

568
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,350
My mistake.

569
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:01,020
He's an old friend of mine.

570
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:29,550
Hey.

571
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:49,200
I have a really bad feeling about this.

572
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,850
What did he say?

573
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:14,310
I'm rather embarrassed,
General Solo...

574
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,890
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honor.

575
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:37,790
Your Royal Highness.

576
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:39,710
These are my friends.

577
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:47,010
3PO, tell them
they must be set free.

578
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:07,940
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

579
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:12,030
3PO, tell them
if they don't do as you wish...

580
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,120
you'll become angry
and use your magic.

581
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,620
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly

582
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,290
Tell them.

583
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,310
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

584
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,020
just as I said they wouldn't.

585
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,390
Wait.

586
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:49,940
What's happening?

587
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:57,080
Put me down!
Help!

588
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,790
Somebody!

589
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:00,200
Somebody help!

590
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:03,040
Master Luke! R2, quickly!

591
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,160
Thank goodness.

592
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,170
Thanks, 3PO.

593
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,380
I never knew I had it in me.

594
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:02,430
...Tatooine...

595
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:06,270
Princess Leia... R2.

596
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,860
...Darth Vader!

597
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:14,780
...Death Star.

598
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,030
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.

599
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:27,540
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.

600
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:31,960
Master Luke...

601
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,260
...Millennium Falcon... Cloud City.

602
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,020
...Vader!

603
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,310
Han Solo...

604
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,940
...carbon.

605
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:54,780
...Sarlacc.

606
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:19,300
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

607
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,690
Wonderful. We are now
a part of the tribe.

608
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:39,030
Just what I always wanted.

609
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:53,130
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

610
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,930
The scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.

611
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:04,050
Good. How far is it?

612
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:05,600
Ask him.

613
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:09,100
We need some fresh supplies too.

614
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:11,190
Try and get our weapons back.

615
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:14,900
Hurry up.
I haven't got all day.

616
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,280
Luke, what's wrong?

617
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:24,660
Leia, do you remember
your mother

618
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,790
your real mother?

619
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:30,410
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

620
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:32,500
What do you remember?

621
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:35,210
Just images really. Feelings.

622
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:36,800
Tell me.

623
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:41,630
She was... very beautiful.

624
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,430
Kind... but sad.

625
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,390
Why are you asking me this?

626
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,980
I have no memory of my mother.

627
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,020
I never knew her.

628
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,980
Luke, tell me.
What's troubling you?

629
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:07,700
Vader is here.
Now. On this moon.

630
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:11,040
How do you know?

631
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,040
I felt his presence.

632
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,340
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

633
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,380
That's why I have to go.

634
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:22,970
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

635
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:26,970
- I have to face him.
- Why?

636
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:33,850
He's my father.

637
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,360
Your father?

638
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:44,740
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

639
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:47,700
If l don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.

640
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,330
Don't talk that way.

641
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:53,960
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

642
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,080
You're wrong, Leia.

643
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:58,090
You have that power too.

644
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:01,510
In time, you'll learn
to use it as I have.

645
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:08,390
The Force is strong in my family.

646
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,810
My father has it.

647
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:15,140
I have it.

648
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:16,560
And...

649
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:20,270
my sister has it.

650
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:29,700
Yes. It's you, Leia.

651
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,420
I know.

652
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,880
Somehow...

653
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:44,340
I've always known.

654
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,470
Then you know
why I have to face him.

655
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:51,010
Luke, run away.
Far away.

656
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:54,430
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

657
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,850
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

658
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,900
You've always been strong.

659
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,480
But why must you confront him?

660
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:07,320
Because there is good in him.
I've felt it.

661
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,450
He won't turn me over
to the emperor.

662
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:12,700
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

663
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,910
I have to try.

664
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:36,390
Hey, what's going on?

665
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:41,480
Nothing. I just wan na
be alone for a little while.

666
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,320
Nothing?

667
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,150
Tell me.
What's going on?

668
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,490
I can't tell you.

669
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,750
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

670
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,060
I'm sorry.

671
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:24,400
Hold me.

672
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:19,870
This is the rebel that surrendered.

673
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,920
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

674
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,750
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

675
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,250
He was armed only with this.

676
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:33,260
Good work, Commander.

677
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:35,300
Leave us.

678
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:39,060
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

679
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,180
Yes, my lord.

680
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,270
The emperor has been expecting you.

681
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:49,070
I know, Father.

682
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:52,900
So, you have accepted the truth.

683
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:57,570
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

684
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:00,910
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

685
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:04,460
It is the name of your true selfi.
You've only forgotten.

686
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,880
I know there is good in you.

687
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,590
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

688
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,800
That was why
you couldn't destroy me.

689
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,390
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

690
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,690
I see you have constructed
a new light saber.

691
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:36,280
Your skills are complete.

692
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:46,120
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has fore seen.

693
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,800
Come with me.

694
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,760
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

695
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:03,850
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

696
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:06,640
I must obey my master.

697
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:11,230
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

698
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:15,190
If that is your destiny.

699
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:19,160
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

700
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,870
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

701
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,540
It is too late for me, son.

702
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:34,090
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

703
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:37,880
He is your master now.

704
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:44,310
Then my father is truly dead.

705
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:29,270
The main entrance
to the control bunker...

706
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,400
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

707
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:35,900
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Don't worry.

708
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:39,150
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

709
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,120
What's he saying?

710
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,540
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

711
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:15,190
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

712
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:18,030
Proceed with the countdown.

713
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:21,700
All groups assume attack coordinates.

714
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:27,030
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

715
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,660
He'll have that shield down on time.

716
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:35,130
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.

717
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:40,840
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

718
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,930
All right. Stand by.

719
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:04,660
Back door, huh? Good idea.

720
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,000
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

721
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:24,010
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

722
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,640
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

723
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:29,220
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

724
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,390
I'm afraid our furry companion...

725
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,640
has gone and done something
rather rash.

726
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:42,070
There goes our surprise attack.

727
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:51,660
Look, over there! Stop him!

728
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:06,590
Not bad for a little fur ball.
There's only one left.

729
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,180
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

730
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:13,520
I have decided that we shall stay here.

731
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:44,380
Hey!

732
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,240
Welcome, young Skywalker.

733
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,660
I have been expecting you.

734
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,660
You'll no longer need those.

735
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,000
Guards, leave us.

736
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:14,890
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

737
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:20,100
In time, you will call me master.

738
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:22,770
You're gravely mistaken.

739
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,940
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

740
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:29,570
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

741
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:35,780
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

742
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:41,330
about a great many things.

743
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,500
His light saber.

744
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:48,500
Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon.

745
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:51,670
Much like your father's.

746
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:56,640
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

747
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,560
So will it be with you.

748
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,640
You're wrong.

749
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:04,980
Soon I'll be dead
and you with me.

750
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:12,690
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

751
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:14,990
Yes.

752
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:20,200
I as sure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

753
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:24,250
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

754
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:27,500
Your faith in your friends is yours.

755
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:33,670
It is pointless to resist, my son.

756
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:43,140
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

757
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:46,480
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

758
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,730
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

759
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:55,400
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

760
01:32:55,490 --> 01:32:58,950
to know the location
of the shield generator.

761
01:32:59,030 --> 01:33:03,120
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

762
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:07,460
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

763
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,760
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

764
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:19,050
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

765
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,970
All right!

766
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:25,600
Up! Move!

767
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:27,190
Quickly. Quickly.

768
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:33,320
Han, hurry.

769
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,320
The fleet will be here any moment.

770
01:33:36,990 --> 01:33:39,280
Charges. Come on. Come on!

771
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:43,240
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

772
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,830
Wait! Come back!

773
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:52,130
R2, stay with me.

774
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:54,800
Freeze!

775
01:33:58,130 --> 01:34:00,090
You rebel scum.

776
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:23,200
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

777
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:26,500
- Gray Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

778
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:29,460
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

779
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:35,300
May the Force be with us.

780
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,890
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield up or down.

781
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:46,220
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know

782
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:48,850
if we're coming.

783
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:52,480
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

784
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,690
I get no reading. You sure?

785
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:56,980
Pull up! All craft pull up!

786
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:05,450
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

787
01:35:07,290 --> 01:35:10,040
Admiral, we have
enemy ships in Sector 47.

788
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,670
It's a trap.

789
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:17,210
Fighters coming in.

790
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:22,050
There's too many.

791
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:28,720
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

792
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:29,890
Copy, Gold Leader.

793
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:34,810
Come, boy.

794
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:37,650
See for yourself.

795
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:45,570
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

796
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:49,490
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

797
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:57,130
You want this...

798
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:59,800
don't you?

799
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:04,430
The hate is swelling in you now.

800
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:07,350
Take your Jedi weapon.

801
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:09,260
Use it.

802
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:11,310
I am unarmed.

803
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:13,310
Strike me down with it.

804
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,980
Give in to your anger.

805
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:22,150
With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.

806
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:30,740
It is unavoidable.

807
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:34,000
It is your destiny.

808
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:38,210
You, like your father...

809
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:39,920
are now...

810
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,510
mine.

811
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:02,990
All right, move it.

812
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:12,580
Hello. I say, over there.

813
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:15,750
Were you looking for me?

814
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,080
Bring those two down here.

815
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:31,050
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

816
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:32,510
Freeze.

817
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:33,770
Don't move.

818
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:35,810
We surrender.

819
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:43,350
The code's changed.

820
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:45,860
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

821
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,980
R2, where are you?

822
01:39:48,110 --> 01:39:50,070
We need you at the bunker
right away.

823
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:53,700
Going? What do you mean?

824
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:57,030
Going where, R2?

825
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:01,330
Wait. R2, this is
no time for heroics.

826
01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:03,120
Come back!

827
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,150
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

828
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:34,240
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

829
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:39,240
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

830
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:41,080
Cut left.
I'll take the leader.

831
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:51,130
They're heading
for the medical frigate.

832
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:57,340
Pressure's steady.

833
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:09,820
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?

834
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:16,200
We're in attack position, sir.

835
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:19,490
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

836
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:22,870
My orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

837
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,960
We only need to
keep them from escaping.

838
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:30,710
As you can see,
my young apprentice...

839
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:34,090
your friends have failed.

840
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:37,300
Now witness the fire power...

841
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:42,760
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

842
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:46,440
Fire at will, Commander.

843
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,190
Fire.

844
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:04,370
That blast came from the Death Star.

845
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:07,660
That thing's operational.

846
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:09,630
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

847
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:11,840
We saw it.
All craft prepare to retreat.

848
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,170
You won't get
another chance at this, Admiral.

849
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:17,050
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

850
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:20,470
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

851
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:24,310
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

852
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:44,540
We're coming.

853
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:51,710
Come on.

854
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:56,920
R2, hurry!

855
01:43:02,930 --> 01:43:03,930
My goodness!

856
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:12,020
Why did you have to be so brave?

857
01:43:15,190 --> 01:43:17,730
Well, I suppose I could
hot-wire this thing.

858
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:19,320
I'll cover you.

859
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:03,360
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

860
01:44:03,490 --> 01:44:06,200
and engage those Stardestroyers
at point-blank range.

861
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:09,750
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.

862
01:44:09,870 --> 01:44:12,500
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

863
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:14,880
and we might
take a few of them with us.

864
01:44:17,790 --> 01:44:19,170
She's gonna blow!

865
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:24,840
I'm hit!

866
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:32,180
Your fleet is lost...

867
01:44:32,270 --> 01:44:36,310
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

868
01:44:38,610 --> 01:44:41,070
There is no escape...

869
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:43,780
my young apprentice.

870
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:48,450
The Alliance will die...

871
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:53,210
as will your friends.

872
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:58,090
Good.

873
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:02,380
I can feel your anger.

874
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:07,640
I am defenseless.
Take your weapon.

875
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:10,890
Strike me down
with all of your hatred...

876
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:15,480
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

877
01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:56,850
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

878
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:52,010
I think I got it.

879
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:53,430
I got it!

880
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:01,980
Are you all right?

881
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,980
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

882
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:05,440
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

883
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,020
Don't move.

884
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:12,990
- I love you.
- I know.

885
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:15,660
Hands up.

886
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:17,990
Stand up.

887
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,300
Stay back.

888
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:39,970
Get down here.
She's wounded.

889
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:41,890
No, wait.

890
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:43,640
I got an idea.

891
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:56,410
Good.

892
01:48:56,530 --> 01:49:00,370
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

893
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:03,210
Let the hate flow through you.

894
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:12,420
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

895
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:18,260
I will not fight you, Father.

896
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:35,200
You are unwise
to lower your defenses.

897
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:02,510
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

898
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:05,810
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

899
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:08,400
There is no conflict.

900
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:12,730
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

901
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:14,820
and I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.

902
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:19,490
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

903
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:21,200
If you will not fight...

904
01:50:21,330 --> 01:50:24,160
then you will meet your destiny.

905
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:36,880
Good.

906
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:38,380
Good.

907
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:50,690
- Watch out. Squad at.06.
- I'm on it, Gold Leader.

908
01:50:52,610 --> 01:50:54,020
Good shot, Red Two.

909
01:50:57,610 --> 01:51:00,740
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

910
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:02,530
Don't let me down.

911
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:08,540
It's over, Commander.

912
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:11,000
The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing.

913
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:13,710
We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit.

914
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:16,710
Send three squads to hel p.

915
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,800
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

916
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:34,400
Throw me another charge.

917
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:54,750
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

918
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,880
I will not fight you.

919
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:04,470
Give yourself to the dark side.

920
01:52:06,050 --> 01:52:10,100
It is the only way
you can save your friends.

921
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:12,850
Yes.

922
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:14,940
Your thoughts betray you.

923
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:17,610
Your feelings for them are strong...

924
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:19,610
especially for...

925
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:23,240
sister.

926
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:29,080
So you have a twin sister.

927
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:32,920
Your feelings have now
betrayed her too.

928
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,090
Obi-Wan was wise
to hide her from me.

929
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:41,630
Now his failure is complete.

930
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:46,890
If you will not turn
to the dark side...

931
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:49,810
then perhaps she will.

932
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:50,850
Never!

933
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,230
Good!

934
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:45,240
Your hate has made you powerful.

935
01:53:46,530 --> 01:53:51,410
Now, fulfill your destiny...

936
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:55,660
and take your father's place at my side.

937
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:11,970
Never.

938
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:17,270
I'll never turn to the dark side.

939
01:54:20,190 --> 01:54:23,070
You've failed, Your Highness.

940
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:25,150
I am a Jedi...

941
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:27,280
Like my father before me.

942
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:38,370
So be it, Jedi.

943
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:40,500
Move! Move!

944
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:56,980
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

945
01:54:57,060 --> 01:55:00,850
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

946
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:02,900
I told you they'd do it.

947
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:12,660
If you will not be turned...

948
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:14,740
you will be destroyed.

949
01:55:23,130 --> 01:55:24,710
Young fool.

950
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:28,720
Only now, at the end...

951
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,720
do you understand.

952
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:49,650
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

953
01:55:53,490 --> 01:55:57,330
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

954
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,630
Father, please!

955
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:22,190
Now, young Skywalker...

956
01:56:24,350 --> 01:56:26,150
you will die.

957
01:57:48,940 --> 01:57:50,440
I'm going in.

958
01:57:53,570 --> 01:57:54,820
Here goes nothing.

959
01:58:01,870 --> 01:58:05,790
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

960
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,460
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

961
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:29,150
Split up and head back to the surface.

962
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:32,400
See if you can get a few
of those TI E fighters to follow you.

963
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:33,530
Copy, Gold Leader.

964
01:58:43,790 --> 01:58:45,410
That was too close.

965
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:51,590
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

966
01:58:51,670 --> 01:58:54,760
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Stardestroyer.

967
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:03,010
Sir, we've lost our
bridge deflector shields.

968
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:06,100
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

969
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:10,400
Intensify forward firepower!

970
01:59:12,190 --> 01:59:13,440
Too late!

971
01:59:58,490 --> 02:00:02,450
Help me take this mask off.

972
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:04,240
But you'll die.

973
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:08,830
Nothing can stop that now.

974
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:11,500
Just for once...

975
02:00:12,290 --> 02:00:14,080
Let me...

976
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:17,670
Look on you with my own eyes.

977
02:00:53,870 --> 02:00:58,340
Now go, my son.

978
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:01,340
Leave me.

979
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:05,010
No. You're coming with me.

980
02:01:05,090 --> 02:01:07,430
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

981
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:12,060
You already have, Luke.

982
02:01:13,190 --> 02:01:15,060
You were right.

983
02:01:15,850 --> 02:01:18,190
You were right about me.

984
02:01:20,110 --> 02:01:21,900
Tell your sister...

985
02:01:22,950 --> 02:01:25,240
you were right.

986
02:01:32,250 --> 02:01:33,370
Father.

987
02:01:37,670 --> 02:01:39,040
I won't leave you.

988
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:05,450
There it is.

989
02:02:08,410 --> 02:02:10,830
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.

990
02:02:10,910 --> 02:02:14,250
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

991
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:36,600
Move the fleet
away from the Death Star.

992
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:25,480
They did it!

993
02:03:33,950 --> 02:03:36,370
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.

994
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:40,000
He wasn't.

995
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,790
I can feel it.

996
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:48,010
You love him.

997
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:52,850
Don't you?

998
02:03:52,970 --> 02:03:54,430
Yes.

999
02:03:54,510 --> 02:03:57,270
All right. I understand.

1000
02:03:57,350 --> 02:03:58,770
Fine.

1001
02:03:59,810 --> 02:04:01,600
When he comes back...

1002
02:04:02,650 --> 02:04:04,440
I won't get in the way.

1003
02:04:07,150 --> 02:04:09,110
It's not like that at all.

1004
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:15,160
He's my brother.

1005
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:58,180
Wesa free!
