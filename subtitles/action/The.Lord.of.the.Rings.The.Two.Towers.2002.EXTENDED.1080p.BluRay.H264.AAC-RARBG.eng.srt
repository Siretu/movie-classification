1
00:01:16,974 --> 00:01:20,585
<i>- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!</i>

2
00:01:25,484 --> 00:01:30,721
<i>I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.</i>

3
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:41,614
<i>Go back to the Shadow.</i>

4
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:46,143
<i>The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!</i>

5
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:54,582
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,402
No! No!

7
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,684
Gandalf!

8
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,977
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,413
No!

10
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,400
Gandalf!

11
00:03:50,232 --> 00:03:52,020
Gandalf!

12
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:55,207
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:58,963
Nothing.

14
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:08,222
Just a dream.

15
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:22,739
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:27,000
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

17
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:40,021
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:45,072
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:49,384
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:57,834
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,166
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:06,349
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:08,925
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:12,163
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:14,989
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:16,930
You never know.

27
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:20,201
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:22,094 --> 00:05:25,868
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:29,173
It is special.

30
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,992
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:40,764
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

32
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:44,693
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:49,228
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:52,009
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,228
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:57,381
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:08,541
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:26,977
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:29,365
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:31,986
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:36,280
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:41,554
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

43
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,307
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

44
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:48,808
...but they did.

45
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:02,995
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,143
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,723
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:27,035
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

49
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:29,896
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:32,808
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:37,597
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,230
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,325
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,764
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

55
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:05,897
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:42,945
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:46,033
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:48,824
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:51,364
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,813
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:55,931
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

62
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:00,120
I can smell it.

63
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:05,808
We're not alone.

64
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:23,564
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:09:23,874 --> 00:09:27,670
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,615
Where is it?

67
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,335
Where is it?

68
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:37,251
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:41,682
My precious.

70
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,825
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,025
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,047
This is Sting.

73
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,820
You've seen it before...

74
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:51,362
...haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:58,916
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,844
It burns!

77
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:19,195
It burns us!

78
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,202
It freezes!

79
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:26,203
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:29,053
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

81
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:36,731
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:39,597
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

83
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:43,243
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:46,135
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:49,963
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,774
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,936
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

88
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,022
Take it off us.

89
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:14,042
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,204
We swears.

91
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,987
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

92
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,350
We swears...

93
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:28,233
...to serve the master
of the precious.

94
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:32,303
We will swear on...

95
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:34,424
...on the precious.

96
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:36,909
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,067
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,321
Yes...

99
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,349
...on the precious.

100
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,188
On the precious.

101
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:53,949
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:59,287
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

103
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:01,291
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:04,531
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

105
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:20,290
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

106
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,143
You've been there before?

107
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,815
Yes.

108
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:41,191
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:53,723
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:58,655
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,016
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:06,710
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

113
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:12,748
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:14:13,138 --> 00:14:15,919
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:21,094
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

116
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:27,960
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:32,724
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,063
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:37,782
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:39,657
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:41,874
Follow me!

122
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:57,124
Merry!

123
00:14:58,151 --> 00:14:59,645
Merry!

124
00:15:05,158 --> 00:15:08,803
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

125
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:10,884
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:16,141
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,304
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:23,774
We will deliver them.

129
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:31,328
Merry!

130
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:33,908
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:15:37,392 --> 00:15:39,180
My friend is sick.

132
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:42,249
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,927
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:51,929
Stop it!

135
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:56,760
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:01,967
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

137
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:04,920
You want some?

138
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:08,951
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:14,369
Merry.

140
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:16,890
Hello, Pip.

141
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,069
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

142
00:16:21,302 --> 00:16:23,790
- It was just an act.
- An act?

143
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:27,222
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:31,802
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,059
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:38,297
Man-flesh.

147
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:42,856
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:45,108
Aragorn.

149
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,685
Let's move!

150
00:17:12,223 --> 00:17:14,710
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,746
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:19,683
Hurry!

153
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,023
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:31,110
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,188
No food. No rest.

156
00:17:34,478 --> 00:17:38,275
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:12,980
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

158
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,786
They may yet be alive.

159
00:18:17,756 --> 00:18:20,177
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:25,263
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:29,755
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:33,598
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:47,075
Rohan.

164
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:50,036
Home of the Horse-lords.

165
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:53,844
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:56,940
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

167
00:18:57,229 --> 00:19:00,076
Sets its will against us.

168
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:08,121
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:19:08,374 --> 00:19:10,893
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:13,917
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:16,058
Saruman.

172
00:19:24,657 --> 00:19:27,690
<i>The world is changing.</i>

173
00:19:27,962 --> 00:19:33,231
<i>Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...</i>

174
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,884
<i>...and Mordor?</i>

175
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:44,041
<i>To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...</i>

176
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:47,956
<i>...and the union of the two towers?</i>

177
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:57,558
<i>Together, my Lord Sauron...</i>

178
00:19:57,826 --> 00:20:01,121
<i>...we shall rule this Middle-earth.</i>

179
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:21,535
<i>The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.</i>

180
00:20:22,183 --> 00:20:25,281
<i>The forests will fall.</i>

181
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:30,105
<i>A new order will rise.</i>

182
00:20:31,294 --> 00:20:36,028
<i>We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...</i>

183
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:40,161
<i>...and the iron fists of the Orc.</i>

184
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:55,981
I want them armed and ready to march
within two weeks!

185
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:57,877
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:58,086 --> 00:21:00,988
They cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

187
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:04,192
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:07,231
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

189
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,858
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

190
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,736
- Burn it.
- Yes.

191
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,742
We will fight for you.

192
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:21,886
Swear it.

193
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:37,026
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:40,205
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:21:40,431 --> 00:21:44,870
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:21:45,202 --> 00:21:46,664
Murderers!

197
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,675
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:21:49,906 --> 00:21:51,662
Burn every village!

199
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:59,800
<i>We have only to remove those
who oppose us.</i>

200
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:02,905
<i>It will begin in Rohan.</i>

201
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:07,116
<i>Too long have these peasants
stood against you.</i>

202
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,148
<i>But no more.</i>

203
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,661
Éothain! Éothain!

204
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,354
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,389
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,298
He is too big for him.

207
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,375
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

208
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:27,143
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

209
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:30,294
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:34,163
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:40,949
Quickly!

212
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,926
Go, child.

213
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,736
<i>Rohan, my lord...</i>

214
00:23:04,185 --> 00:23:06,834
<i>...is ready to fall.</i>

215
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:19,725
Théodred.

216
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,427
Find the king's son!

217
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:43,800
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,742
My Lord Éomer, over here!

219
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,293
He's alive.

220
00:24:29,203 --> 00:24:31,178
Théodred.

221
00:24:44,753 --> 00:24:47,655
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:50,426
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:55,706
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:58,619
That is a lie.

225
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:05,542
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

226
00:25:07,276 --> 00:25:09,217
Grima.

227
00:25:10,814 --> 00:25:12,701
Grima.

228
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:16,745
Grima.

229
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:20,552
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

230
00:25:21,023 --> 00:25:24,537
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

231
00:25:25,262 --> 00:25:28,076
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:25:36,072 --> 00:25:41,636
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:44,313
Can you not see?

234
00:25:44,715 --> 00:25:49,570
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

235
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,253
...your warmongering.

236
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:56,433
Warmongering?

237
00:25:56,827 --> 00:25:58,867
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

238
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,033
What was the promised price, Grima?

239
00:26:02,332 --> 00:26:05,845
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

240
00:26:18,384 --> 00:26:20,968
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:26:21,251 --> 00:26:23,161
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:35,551
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

243
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:36,948
Too much.

244
00:26:39,304 --> 00:26:43,941
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

245
00:26:44,276 --> 00:26:48,912
...and all its domains
under pain of death.

246
00:26:49,481 --> 00:26:51,848
You have no authority here.

247
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:54,385
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:26:55,086 --> 00:26:58,796
This order does not come from me.

249
00:26:59,091 --> 00:27:01,132
It comes from the king.

250
00:27:01,895 --> 00:27:04,283
He signed it this morning.

251
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,679
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:40,656
Breathe.

253
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:48,547
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,734
We're not going no further...

255
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:08,871
...until we've had a breather.

256
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:11,317
Get a fire going!

257
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,030
Merry!

258
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:18,780
Merry!

259
00:28:20,442 --> 00:28:25,558
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:37,229
What's making that noise?

261
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:40,303
It's the trees.

262
00:28:41,162 --> 00:28:42,162
What?

263
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:46,173
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:50,875
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

265
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,766
...and come alive.

266
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:54,699
Alive?

267
00:28:55,511 --> 00:28:57,169
Trees that could whisper...

268
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,701
...talk to each other...

269
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,706
...even move.

270
00:29:04,287 --> 00:29:06,556
I'm starving.

271
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,684
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

272
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,337
Yeah!

273
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:15,827
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:20,339
What about them?

275
00:29:20,737 --> 00:29:22,591
They're fresh.

276
00:29:23,206 --> 00:29:26,850
They are not for eating.

277
00:29:33,015 --> 00:29:34,902
What about their legs?

278
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:37,322
They don't need those.

279
00:29:38,955 --> 00:29:41,955
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

280
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,662
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:51,054
Alive?

282
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:58,162
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

283
00:30:00,845 --> 00:30:04,008
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

284
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:07,184
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:30:10,221 --> 00:30:12,043
They think we have the Ring.

286
00:30:12,256 --> 00:30:14,678
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

287
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:18,403
Just a mouthful...

288
00:30:18,796 --> 00:30:19,908
...a bit of the flank.

289
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:30,120
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

290
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,127
Pippin.

291
00:30:38,317 --> 00:30:40,007
Let's go.

292
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:49,953
Go on.

293
00:30:50,194 --> 00:30:51,688
Call for help.

294
00:30:53,066 --> 00:30:54,113
Squeal.

295
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,333
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:08,055
Pippin!

297
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,827
A red sun rises.

298
00:31:35,374 --> 00:31:38,189
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:32:09,442 --> 00:32:11,264
Riders of Rohan...

300
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,148
...what news from the Mark?

301
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:46,200
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,360
Speak quickly!

303
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:53,259
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:05,019
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

305
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,889
...if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

306
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:10,978
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:33:19,849 --> 00:33:21,671
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:26,043
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:33:26,354 --> 00:33:29,583
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

310
00:33:31,327 --> 00:33:34,971
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

311
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:37,372
Not even his own kin.

312
00:33:42,072 --> 00:33:43,959
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

313
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,062
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:50,982
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,004
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,250
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:01,359
He walks here and there, they say...

318
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,647
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:09,139
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

320
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,702
We are no spies.

321
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:14,750
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,310
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

323
00:34:18,243 --> 00:34:20,698
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:34:20,946 --> 00:34:23,944
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:34:24,214 --> 00:34:27,084
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

326
00:34:30,488 --> 00:34:32,397
We left none alive.

327
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,006
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:42,842
Dead?

329
00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:47,430
I am sorry.

330
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:55,316
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:34:57,248 --> 00:35:01,754
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:04,714
Farewell.

333
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:12,067
Look for your friends.

334
00:35:12,698 --> 00:35:14,803
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:35:16,468 --> 00:35:18,988
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:35:19,305 --> 00:35:21,193
We ride north!

337
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:13,747
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:36:27,508 --> 00:36:29,417
We failed them.

339
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:45,799
A Hobbit lay here.

340
00:36:47,796 --> 00:36:49,257
And the other.

341
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,768
They crawled.

342
00:37:05,914 --> 00:37:07,888
Their hands were bound.

343
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:21,917
Their bonds were cut.

344
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:39,387
They ran over here.

345
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,299
They were followed.

346
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,251
The belt!

347
00:37:53,263 --> 00:37:54,310
Run!

348
00:37:58,134 --> 00:37:59,431
Tracks lead away from the battle...

349
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,215
...into Fangorn Forest.

350
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,705
Fangorn?

351
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,333
What madness drove them in there?

352
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:32,104
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

353
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:42,206
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

354
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Come here!

355
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,680
Trees. Climb a tree.

356
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,729
He's gone.

357
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:23,090
Merry!

358
00:39:34,735 --> 00:39:38,891
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

359
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:47,705
Run, Merry!

360
00:39:57,457 --> 00:40:01,733
Little Orcs.

361
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:04,233
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

362
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:06,319
Tree?

363
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:09,403
I am no tree!

364
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:11,942
I am an Ent.

365
00:40:12,506 --> 00:40:14,710
A tree-herder.

366
00:40:15,243 --> 00:40:17,129
A shepherd of the forest.

367
00:40:17,344 --> 00:40:18,773
Don't talk to it, Merry.

368
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:20,740
Don't encourage it!

369
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:25,007
Treebeard, some call me.

370
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:27,207
And whose side are you on?

371
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:29,416
Side?

372
00:40:29,824 --> 00:40:32,442
I am on nobody's side...

373
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:38,078
...because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

374
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:43,640
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

375
00:40:44,172 --> 00:40:46,409
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

376
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:48,945
Hobbits?

377
00:40:50,244 --> 00:40:54,947
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

378
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,692
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

379
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:03,063
They come with fire.

380
00:41:03,325 --> 00:41:05,845
They come with axes.

381
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:10,765
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

382
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:14,810
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

383
00:41:15,137 --> 00:41:17,886
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

384
00:41:18,173 --> 00:41:19,929
Halflings!

385
00:41:20,174 --> 00:41:21,222
Shire-folk!

386
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,744
Maybe you are...

387
00:41:24,112 --> 00:41:27,658
...and maybe you aren't.

388
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:32,659
The White Wizard will know.

389
00:41:33,488 --> 00:41:35,343
The White Wizard?

390
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,401
Saruman.

391
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:52,765
See? See?

392
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:55,278
We've led you out.

393
00:41:55,511 --> 00:41:57,999
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

394
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,606
Very lucky we find you.

395
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:11,985
Nice Hobbit.

396
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:18,096
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

397
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,954
A swamp, yes, yes.

398
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,278
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

399
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,141
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

400
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,072
I found it. I did.

401
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,940
The way through the marshes.

402
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,674
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

403
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:48,891
They go around for miles and miles.

404
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,695
Come quickly.

405
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:54,797
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

406
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:59,238
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

407
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:01,813
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

408
00:43:02,048 --> 00:43:05,210
No, no birdses to eat.

409
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:09,743
No crunchable birdses.

410
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:13,204
We are famished! Yes!

411
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:17,714
Famished we are, precious!

412
00:43:32,845 --> 00:43:34,219
Here.

413
00:43:35,448 --> 00:43:37,390
What does it eats?

414
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:39,670
Is it tasty?

415
00:43:45,024 --> 00:43:47,414
It tries to chokes us!

416
00:43:47,928 --> 00:43:51,310
We can't eats Hobbit food!

417
00:43:53,233 --> 00:43:57,094
We must starve!

418
00:43:57,403 --> 00:43:59,770
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

419
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:02,744
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

420
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:05,726
It does not care if we be hungry.

421
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:10,617
Does not care if we should die.

422
00:44:11,351 --> 00:44:14,100
Not like master.

423
00:44:15,523 --> 00:44:17,694
Master cares.

424
00:44:18,925 --> 00:44:20,747
Master knows.

425
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,118
Yes.

426
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:27,918
Precious.

427
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:35,051
Once it takes hold of us...

428
00:44:37,078 --> 00:44:41,071
...it never lets go.

429
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:43,063
Don't touch me!

430
00:45:15,484 --> 00:45:17,306
There are dead things!

431
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,242
Dead faces in the water.

432
00:45:24,194 --> 00:45:27,990
All dead. All rotten.

433
00:45:28,764 --> 00:45:32,244
Elves and Men and Orcses.

434
00:45:32,768 --> 00:45:36,116
A great battle long ago.

435
00:45:37,106 --> 00:45:38,829
Dead Marshes.

436
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:41,726
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

437
00:45:43,413 --> 00:45:45,135
This way.

438
00:45:45,348 --> 00:45:48,031
Don't follow the lights.

439
00:45:49,952 --> 00:45:53,695
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

440
00:45:54,023 --> 00:45:57,917
...and light little candles
of their own.

441
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,749
Frodo!

442
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:14,741
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

443
00:47:15,074 --> 00:47:16,895
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

444
00:47:17,108 --> 00:47:18,930
Are you all right?

445
00:47:47,941 --> 00:47:50,787
So bright.

446
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,754
So beautiful.

447
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:58,757
Our precious.

448
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,847
What did you say?

449
00:48:02,055 --> 00:48:04,095
Master should be resting.

450
00:48:04,324 --> 00:48:08,218
Master needs to keep up his strength.

451
00:48:10,363 --> 00:48:13,625
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

452
00:48:13,899 --> 00:48:15,241
Gollum. Gollum.

453
00:48:15,469 --> 00:48:17,225
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

454
00:48:17,438 --> 00:48:21,528
<i>Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home</i>

455
00:48:21,843 --> 00:48:23,249
He said your life was a sad story.

456
00:48:23,477 --> 00:48:27,884
<i>They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead</i>

457
00:48:28,248 --> 00:48:31,118
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

458
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:33,109
Were you?

459
00:48:35,356 --> 00:48:37,625
Sméagol.

460
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:44,817
What did you call me?

461
00:48:46,235 --> 00:48:48,917
That was your name once, wasn't it?

462
00:48:49,504 --> 00:48:51,871
A long time ago.

463
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,880
My name.

464
00:48:56,044 --> 00:48:57,386
My name.

465
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,774
Sméagol.

466
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:12,618
Black Riders!

467
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:14,071
Hide! Hide!

468
00:49:24,773 --> 00:49:26,944
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

469
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:30,721
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

470
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:34,132
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

471
00:49:34,384 --> 00:49:37,198
No, you cannot kill them. No.

472
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,691
Wraiths!

473
00:50:05,915 --> 00:50:07,988
Wraiths on wings!

474
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:18,034
They are calling for it.

475
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:21,743
They are calling for the precious.

476
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:26,040
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

477
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:27,447
I'm here.

478
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:45,081
Hurry, Hobbits.

479
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:49,385
The Black Gate is very close.

480
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:58,255
Orc blood.

481
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,004
These are strange tracks.

482
00:51:11,317 --> 00:51:13,258
The air is so close in here.

483
00:51:14,486 --> 00:51:16,875
This forest is old.

484
00:51:17,823 --> 00:51:19,732
Very old.

485
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:23,760
Full of memory...

486
00:51:26,398 --> 00:51:28,732
...and anger.

487
00:51:34,974 --> 00:51:37,788
The trees are speaking to each other.

488
00:51:38,043 --> 00:51:39,385
Gimli!

489
00:51:39,779 --> 00:51:41,469
Lower your ax.

490
00:51:44,383 --> 00:51:47,065
They have feelings, my friend.

491
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:49,707
The Elves began it.

492
00:51:49,956 --> 00:51:54,363
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

493
00:51:55,161 --> 00:51:57,365
Talking trees.

494
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:01,067
What do trees have to talk about?

495
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:04,334
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

496
00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:09,449
Something's out there.

497
00:52:16,148 --> 00:52:17,872
What do you see?

498
00:52:18,452 --> 00:52:20,873
The White Wizard approaches.

499
00:52:27,128 --> 00:52:31,185
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

500
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:43,147
We must be quick.

501
00:52:58,893 --> 00:53:02,308
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

502
00:53:03,065 --> 00:53:04,341
Where are they?

503
00:53:04,532 --> 00:53:08,012
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

504
00:53:08,336 --> 00:53:12,361
They met someone they did not expect.

505
00:53:12,874 --> 00:53:14,882
Does that comfort you?

506
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,997
Who are you?

507
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,367
Show yourself!

508
00:53:29,357 --> 00:53:31,300
It cannot be.

509
00:53:34,362 --> 00:53:35,362
Forgive me.

510
00:53:37,032 --> 00:53:38,919
I mistook you for Saruman.

511
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:42,322
I am Saruman.

512
00:53:44,072 --> 00:53:47,782
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

513
00:53:48,944 --> 00:53:50,286
You fell.

514
00:53:51,914 --> 00:53:54,248
Through fire...

515
00:53:54,484 --> 00:53:55,858
...and water.

516
00:53:57,319 --> 00:53:59,806
<i>From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...</i>

517
00:54:00,056 --> 00:54:03,634
<i>...I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.</i>

518
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:22,160
<i>U ntil at last I threw down
my enemy...</i>

519
00:54:22,412 --> 00:54:26,786
<i>...and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.</i>

520
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:35,357
<i>Darkness took me...</i>

521
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:40,154
<i>...and I strayed out of thought
and time.</i>

522
00:54:41,131 --> 00:54:44,066
<i>Stars wheeled overhead...</i>

523
00:54:44,402 --> 00:54:48,809
<i>...and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.</i>

524
00:54:51,108 --> 00:54:53,115
<i>But it was not the end.</i>

525
00:54:53,444 --> 00:54:56,160
<i>I felt life in me again.</i>

526
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,737
<i>I've been sent back...</i>

527
00:55:00,985 --> 00:55:02,392
...until my task is done.

528
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,774
Gandalf.

529
00:55:05,423 --> 00:55:07,311
Gandalf?

530
00:55:07,926 --> 00:55:09,681
Yes.

531
00:55:12,397 --> 00:55:14,153
That was what they used to call me.

532
00:55:17,134 --> 00:55:19,239
Gandalf the Grey.

533
00:55:20,806 --> 00:55:22,366
That was my name.

534
00:55:22,742 --> 00:55:24,050
Gandalf.

535
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,053
I am Gandalf the White.

536
00:55:31,184 --> 00:55:34,085
And I come back to you now...

537
00:55:34,386 --> 00:55:36,842
...at the turn of the tide.

538
00:55:38,057 --> 00:55:40,904
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

539
00:55:41,828 --> 00:55:44,827
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

540
00:55:45,898 --> 00:55:47,872
That is no short distance!

541
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:51,232
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

542
00:55:51,503 --> 00:55:53,478
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

543
00:55:53,906 --> 00:55:57,102
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

544
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,297
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

545
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:03,668
...in this horrid, dark, dank,
tree-infested...?

546
00:56:06,352 --> 00:56:09,352
I mean, charming...

547
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:12,310
...quite charming forest.

548
00:56:13,025 --> 00:56:16,603
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

549
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:21,019
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

550
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:24,718
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

551
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:28,169
...that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

552
00:56:28,442 --> 00:56:31,311
I n one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

553
00:56:31,744 --> 00:56:35,093
You still speak in riddles.

554
00:56:38,117 --> 00:56:44,195
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

555
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:48,140
The Ents are going to wake up...

556
00:56:48,929 --> 00:56:53,151
...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

557
00:56:54,169 --> 00:56:55,248
Oh, that's good.

558
00:56:55,436 --> 00:56:58,054
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

559
00:56:59,274 --> 00:57:01,378
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

560
00:57:01,775 --> 00:57:05,124
I n fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

561
00:57:05,413 --> 00:57:09,024
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

562
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,902
That is one of the Mearas...

563
00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:35,824
...unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

564
00:57:53,495 --> 00:57:55,764
Shadowfax.

565
00:57:58,334 --> 00:58:00,921
He is the lord of all horses...

566
00:58:02,538 --> 00:58:06,280
...and has been my friend
through many dangers.

567
00:58:20,825 --> 00:58:24,172
<i>O rowan mine</i>

568
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:28,137
<i>I saw you shine</i>

569
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:31,912
<i>U pon a summer's day</i>

570
00:58:33,136 --> 00:58:37,358
<i>U pon your head
How golden-red</i>

571
00:58:37,842 --> 00:58:42,281
<i>The crown you bore aloft</i>

572
00:58:42,778 --> 00:58:45,015
Such a beautiful verse.

573
00:58:45,248 --> 00:58:49,983
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

574
00:58:50,321 --> 00:58:53,419
You might call it far, perhaps.

575
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:58,134
My home lies deep in the forest...

576
00:58:58,462 --> 00:59:02,237
...near the roots of the mountain.

577
00:59:03,769 --> 00:59:07,183
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

578
00:59:07,505 --> 00:59:11,334
And safe is where I'll keep you.

579
00:59:11,876 --> 00:59:15,999
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

580
00:59:16,513 --> 00:59:19,384
It's one of my own compositions.

581
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:20,963
Right.

582
00:59:21,153 --> 00:59:27,001
<i>Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves</i>

583
00:59:27,427 --> 00:59:32,095
<i>And the dreams of trees unfold</i>

584
00:59:32,464 --> 00:59:38,727
<i>When woodland halls are green and cool</i>

585
00:59:39,138 --> 00:59:43,065
<i>And the wind is in the West</i>

586
00:59:43,775 --> 00:59:46,196
<i>Come back to me</i>

587
00:59:46,946 --> 00:59:51,168
<i>Come back to me</i>

588
00:59:51,484 --> 00:59:57,746
<i>And say my land is best</i>

589
01:00:05,398 --> 01:00:08,976
Sleep, little Shirelings.

590
01:00:09,268 --> 01:00:12,781
Heed no nightly noise.

591
01:00:13,072 --> 01:00:16,847
Sleep till morning light.

592
01:00:18,544 --> 01:00:22,668
I have business in the forest.

593
01:00:22,983 --> 01:00:28,197
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

594
01:00:29,789 --> 01:00:34,164
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

595
01:00:34,494 --> 01:00:40,124
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

596
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:53,936
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

597
01:00:54,949 --> 01:00:57,337
Sauron will suffer no rival.

598
01:00:57,985 --> 01:01:02,043
From the summit of Barad-dûr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

599
01:01:02,356 --> 01:01:05,672
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

600
01:01:06,861 --> 01:01:08,749
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

601
01:01:08,964 --> 01:01:11,330
The rumor has reached him.

602
01:01:11,766 --> 01:01:14,449
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.

603
01:01:15,537 --> 01:01:18,287
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

604
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:21,913
He fears what you may become.

605
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:26,407
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

606
01:01:26,881 --> 01:01:30,230
He will use his puppet, Saruman,
to destroy Rohan.

607
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:32,046
War is coming.

608
01:01:32,253 --> 01:01:35,766
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

609
01:01:36,057 --> 01:01:38,326
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

610
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:42,138
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

611
01:01:42,464 --> 01:01:45,399
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

612
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:50,242
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

613
01:01:51,272 --> 01:01:53,312
But for all their cunning...

614
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:56,097
...we have one advantage.

615
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,834
The Ring remains hidden.

616
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:03,806
And that we should seek to destroy it...

617
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:06,900
...has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

618
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:10,784
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

619
01:02:11,092 --> 01:02:12,435
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

620
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:16,724
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

621
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,453
We must trust now in Frodo.

622
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,496
Everything depends upon speed...

623
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:24,740
...and the secrecy of his quest.

624
01:02:26,842 --> 01:02:29,974
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

625
01:02:31,015 --> 01:02:33,697
Frodo must finish this task alone.

626
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:36,783
He's not alone.

627
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,513
Sam went with him.

628
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,435
Did he?

629
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:45,133
Did he, indeed? Good.

630
01:02:45,997 --> 01:02:48,265
Yes, very good.

631
01:02:56,373 --> 01:03:01,075
The Black Gate of Mordor.

632
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:06,382
Oh, save us.

633
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:15,356
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

634
01:03:17,862 --> 01:03:22,052
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

635
01:03:22,401 --> 01:03:25,783
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

636
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,215
I did.

637
01:03:36,048 --> 01:03:37,989
That's it, then.

638
01:03:39,551 --> 01:03:40,892
We can't get past that.

639
01:04:26,098 --> 01:04:27,343
Look!

640
01:04:27,533 --> 01:04:29,027
The gate.

641
01:04:29,235 --> 01:04:30,347
It's opening!

642
01:04:37,911 --> 01:04:39,820
I can see a way down.

643
01:04:40,514 --> 01:04:42,685
Sam, no!

644
01:04:44,918 --> 01:04:46,162
Master!

645
01:06:10,073 --> 01:06:13,368
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

646
01:06:14,311 --> 01:06:17,309
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

647
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:19,769
- Now!
- No!

648
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:22,236
No! No, master!

649
01:06:22,485 --> 01:06:25,355
They catch you! They catch you!

650
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:29,257
Don't take it to him.

651
01:06:32,295 --> 01:06:34,945
He wants the precious.

652
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:38,100
Always he is looking for it.

653
01:06:38,401 --> 01:06:42,144
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

654
01:06:42,507 --> 01:06:46,280
But we mustn't let him have it.

655
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:54,923
No! There's another way.

656
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:57,771
More secret. A dark way.

657
01:06:58,156 --> 01:07:01,734
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

658
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,260
He's up to something.

659
01:07:03,961 --> 01:07:06,350
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

660
01:07:06,764 --> 01:07:09,251
Yes. There's a path...

661
01:07:09,534 --> 01:07:11,990
...and some stairs.

662
01:07:12,271 --> 01:07:13,928
And then...

663
01:07:14,138 --> 01:07:17,302
...a tunnel.

664
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:33,178
He's led us this far, Sam.

665
01:07:33,392 --> 01:07:34,820
Mr. Frodo, no.

666
01:07:36,028 --> 01:07:37,336
He's been true to his word.

667
01:07:42,301 --> 01:07:43,414
No.

668
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:47,200
Lead the way, Sméagol.

669
01:07:47,973 --> 01:07:51,748
Good Sméagol always helps.

670
01:08:25,879 --> 01:08:26,879
Hello?

671
01:08:29,215 --> 01:08:31,190
Treebeard?

672
01:08:31,985 --> 01:08:33,262
Where has he gone?

673
01:08:33,454 --> 01:08:35,874
I had the loveliest dream last night.

674
01:08:36,522 --> 01:08:39,140
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

675
01:08:39,392 --> 01:08:41,879
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

676
01:08:42,394 --> 01:08:44,282
...you were sick.

677
01:08:46,033 --> 01:08:48,783
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

678
01:08:52,306 --> 01:08:54,193
Did you hear that?

679
01:09:01,347 --> 01:09:02,755
There it is again.

680
01:09:03,752 --> 01:09:08,094
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

681
01:09:12,092 --> 01:09:14,906
You just said something... Treeish.

682
01:09:15,195 --> 01:09:18,992
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

683
01:09:26,808 --> 01:09:28,466
You're taller.

684
01:09:29,144 --> 01:09:30,485
- Who?
- You!

685
01:09:30,878 --> 01:09:32,340
- Than what?
- Than me!

686
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:35,020
I've always been taller than you.

687
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:39,756
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

688
01:09:40,823 --> 01:09:42,197
Please, Merry.

689
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:46,099
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

690
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:49,644
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

691
01:09:51,901 --> 01:09:54,005
3'8"!

692
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:57,860
Three-foot-eight.

693
01:10:00,977 --> 01:10:02,831
You did something.

694
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:10,177
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

695
01:10:11,187 --> 01:10:12,528
Merry!

696
01:10:12,888 --> 01:10:15,092
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

697
01:10:15,324 --> 01:10:19,065
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

698
01:10:19,395 --> 01:10:21,435
Give me it back. Merry!

699
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:24,807
What's happening?!

700
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:27,063
It's got my leg!

701
01:10:27,437 --> 01:10:28,930
Merry!

702
01:10:48,324 --> 01:10:49,950
Help!

703
01:10:56,633 --> 01:10:58,456
Away with you.

704
01:10:58,836 --> 01:11:00,428
You should not be waking.

705
01:11:01,104 --> 01:11:05,773
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

706
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:08,997
Go to sleep.

707
01:11:09,414 --> 01:11:11,235
Away with you.

708
01:11:11,449 --> 01:11:14,710
Come, the forest is waking up.

709
01:11:15,353 --> 01:11:17,207
It isn't safe.

710
01:11:19,991 --> 01:11:23,766
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

711
01:11:24,063 --> 01:11:26,965
Anger festers in their hearts.

712
01:11:27,965 --> 01:11:29,426
Black are their thoughts.

713
01:11:29,802 --> 01:11:32,136
Strong is their hate.

714
01:11:32,404 --> 01:11:35,086
They will harm you if they can.

715
01:11:35,339 --> 01:11:38,819
There are too few of us now.

716
01:11:39,142 --> 01:11:42,940
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

717
01:11:43,849 --> 01:11:46,238
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

718
01:11:46,518 --> 01:11:49,713
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

719
01:11:49,987 --> 01:11:55,290
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

720
01:11:55,828 --> 01:12:00,814
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

721
01:12:01,266 --> 01:12:02,542
Oh, I'm sorry.

722
01:12:02,835 --> 01:12:06,610
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

723
01:12:06,939 --> 01:12:09,971
We lost them.

724
01:12:10,274 --> 01:12:15,096
And now we cannot find them.

725
01:12:15,482 --> 01:12:21,558
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

726
01:12:21,987 --> 01:12:24,353
Can't say that I have.

727
01:12:25,024 --> 01:12:26,998
You, Pip?

728
01:12:28,461 --> 01:12:30,850
What do they look like?

729
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:37,872
I don't remember now.

730
01:12:54,421 --> 01:12:58,195
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

731
01:12:59,126 --> 01:13:01,744
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

732
01:13:02,429 --> 01:13:05,178
<i>...whose mind is overthrown.</i>

733
01:13:05,432 --> 01:13:09,654
<i>Saruman 's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.</i>

734
01:13:10,371 --> 01:13:13,370
My lord, your son...

735
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:15,879
...he is dead.

736
01:13:17,411 --> 01:13:19,167
My lord?

737
01:13:20,481 --> 01:13:21,724
Uncle?

738
01:13:28,455 --> 01:13:30,725
Will you not go to him?

739
01:13:33,929 --> 01:13:36,165
Will you do nothing?

740
01:13:36,397 --> 01:13:38,307
Be careful what you say.

741
01:13:38,566 --> 01:13:40,770
Do not look for welcome here.

742
01:14:04,894 --> 01:14:08,854
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

743
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:11,238
What a tragedy for the king...

744
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,346
...to lose his only son and heir.

745
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:19,978
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

746
01:14:20,309 --> 01:14:25,043
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

747
01:14:25,381 --> 01:14:26,876
Leave me alone, snake!

748
01:14:28,317 --> 01:14:29,942
Oh, but you are alone.

749
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:36,158
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

750
01:14:36,525 --> 01:14:39,873
...in the bitter watches of the night...

751
01:14:40,196 --> 01:14:43,774
...when all your life seems to shrink.

752
01:14:44,066 --> 01:14:48,059
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

753
01:14:48,404 --> 01:14:52,844
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

754
01:14:55,245 --> 01:14:57,066
So fair.

755
01:14:58,381 --> 01:14:59,789
So cold.

756
01:15:01,518 --> 01:15:03,688
Like a morning of pale spring...

757
01:15:03,953 --> 01:15:07,183
...still clinging to winter's chill.

758
01:15:21,139 --> 01:15:23,440
Your words are poison.

759
01:16:56,203 --> 01:16:58,504
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

760
01:17:13,053 --> 01:17:16,730
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

761
01:17:18,292 --> 01:17:20,812
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

762
01:17:38,245 --> 01:17:39,969
Your staff.

763
01:17:43,385 --> 01:17:46,800
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

764
01:18:05,775 --> 01:18:08,393
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

765
01:18:16,918 --> 01:18:18,325
He's a herald of woe.

766
01:18:18,554 --> 01:18:22,896
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

767
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,468
...Théoden King.

768
01:18:26,295 --> 01:18:28,782
He's not welcome.

769
01:18:29,832 --> 01:18:34,883
Why should I welcome you...

770
01:18:35,538 --> 01:18:39,083
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

771
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:42,670
A just question, my liege.

772
01:18:42,946 --> 01:18:45,728
Late is the hour...

773
01:18:45,982 --> 01:18:49,778
...in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

774
01:18:50,787 --> 01:18:52,761
Láthspell I name him.

775
01:18:52,989 --> 01:18:55,803
Ill news is an ill guest.

776
01:18:56,058 --> 01:19:00,334
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

777
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,653
I have not passed
through fire and death...

778
01:19:02,866 --> 01:19:05,932
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

779
01:19:07,037 --> 01:19:09,043
His staff.

780
01:19:09,306 --> 01:19:13,234
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

781
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,735
Théoden...

782
01:19:19,283 --> 01:19:21,803
...son of Thengel...

783
01:19:23,754 --> 01:19:25,958
...too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

784
01:19:29,026 --> 01:19:32,125
I would stay still if I were you.

785
01:19:32,396 --> 01:19:34,371
Hearken to me!

786
01:19:40,038 --> 01:19:42,077
I release you...

787
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:44,227
...from the spell.

788
01:19:55,955 --> 01:19:58,823
You have no power here...

789
01:19:59,124 --> 01:20:02,635
...Gandalf the Grey.

790
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:12,988
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

791
01:20:22,581 --> 01:20:24,108
Wait.

792
01:20:25,551 --> 01:20:29,261
If I go, Théoden dies.

793
01:20:30,155 --> 01:20:32,227
You did not kill me...

794
01:20:32,491 --> 01:20:34,727
...you will not kill him.

795
01:20:38,565 --> 01:20:40,255
Rohan is mine.

796
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,111
Be gone.

797
01:21:27,581 --> 01:21:29,752
I know your face.

798
01:21:34,321 --> 01:21:35,498
Éowyn.

799
01:21:37,992 --> 01:21:39,138
Éowyn.

800
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:48,548
Gandalf?

801
01:21:49,236 --> 01:21:51,986
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

802
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:07,939
Dark have been my dreams of late.

803
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,804
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

804
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:18,978
...if they grasped your sword.

805
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,089
I've only...

806
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:09,217
...ever served you, my lord.

807
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:14,309
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

808
01:23:15,527 --> 01:23:17,382
Send me not from your sight.

809
01:23:19,897 --> 01:23:22,385
No, my lord! No, my lord.

810
01:23:22,834 --> 01:23:23,946
Let him go.

811
01:23:24,601 --> 01:23:27,829
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

812
01:23:37,081 --> 01:23:39,251
Get out of my way!

813
01:23:41,553 --> 01:23:44,716
Hail, Théoden King!

814
01:24:09,347 --> 01:24:11,835
Where is Théodred?

815
01:24:14,953 --> 01:24:17,321
Where is my son?

816
01:25:44,612 --> 01:25:46,302
Simbelmynë.

817
01:25:51,518 --> 01:25:55,032
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

818
01:25:59,061 --> 01:26:01,908
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

819
01:26:04,099 --> 01:26:07,809
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

820
01:26:08,804 --> 01:26:12,960
The young perish and the old linger.

821
01:26:13,809 --> 01:26:15,783
That I should live...

822
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:19,207
...to see the last days of my house.

823
01:26:20,514 --> 01:26:24,257
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

824
01:26:27,456 --> 01:26:30,805
No parent should have to bury
their child.

825
01:26:47,577 --> 01:26:49,398
He was strong in life.

826
01:26:50,546 --> 01:26:54,025
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

827
01:27:38,863 --> 01:27:40,520
They had no warning.

828
01:27:40,931 --> 01:27:43,169
They were unarmed.

829
01:27:43,802 --> 01:27:47,664
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

830
01:27:48,807 --> 01:27:50,529
Rick, cot and tree.

831
01:27:51,009 --> 01:27:53,114
Where is Mama?

832
01:27:54,012 --> 01:27:58,038
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

833
01:27:58,384 --> 01:28:02,639
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

834
01:28:04,323 --> 01:28:07,192
Ride out and meet him head on.

835
01:28:08,094 --> 01:28:11,354
Draw him away from your women
and children.

836
01:28:11,964 --> 01:28:13,425
You must fight.

837
01:28:13,799 --> 01:28:17,344
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

838
01:28:17,802 --> 01:28:19,263
Éomer is loyal to you.

839
01:28:19,471 --> 01:28:22,122
His men will return
and fight for their king.

840
01:28:22,374 --> 01:28:26,147
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

841
01:28:30,015 --> 01:28:32,120
Éomer cannot help us.

842
01:28:32,885 --> 01:28:34,478
I know what it is you want of me...

843
01:28:34,886 --> 01:28:37,952
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

844
01:28:39,824 --> 01:28:41,319
I will not risk open war.

845
01:28:43,596 --> 01:28:46,913
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

846
01:28:51,304 --> 01:28:52,896
When last I looked...

847
01:28:53,339 --> 01:28:56,884
...Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

848
01:29:03,883 --> 01:29:06,022
Then what is the king's decision?

849
01:29:11,758 --> 01:29:12,968
<i>By order of the king...</i>

850
01:29:13,193 --> 01:29:14,501
...the city must empty.

851
01:29:15,896 --> 01:29:18,645
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

852
01:29:19,032 --> 01:29:22,774
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

853
01:29:23,103 --> 01:29:24,478
Helm's Deep.

854
01:29:24,838 --> 01:29:28,132
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

855
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,328
Who will defend them if not their king?

856
01:29:30,544 --> 01:29:33,000
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

857
01:29:33,247 --> 01:29:35,003
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

858
01:29:35,216 --> 01:29:38,991
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

859
01:29:39,287 --> 01:29:41,359
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

860
01:29:41,588 --> 01:29:43,792
What they will get is a massacre.

861
01:29:45,358 --> 01:29:47,813
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

862
01:29:48,830 --> 01:29:51,960
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

863
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,282
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

864
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:58,490
The people of Rohan will need you.

865
01:29:59,106 --> 01:30:01,374
The defenses have to hold.

866
01:30:03,010 --> 01:30:04,734
They will hold.

867
01:30:08,817 --> 01:30:10,955
The Grey Pilgrim.

868
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:13,773
That's what they used to call me.

869
01:30:14,055 --> 01:30:18,910
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

870
01:30:20,629 --> 01:30:22,865
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

871
01:30:23,432 --> 01:30:26,692
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

872
01:30:27,569 --> 01:30:30,186
At dawn, look to the east.

873
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:32,033
Go.

874
01:30:59,369 --> 01:31:02,533
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

875
01:31:41,879 --> 01:31:43,821
His name is Brego.

876
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:47,171
He was my cousin's horse.

877
01:31:47,451 --> 01:31:49,207
Brego.

878
01:31:50,888 --> 01:31:53,407
Your name is kingly.

879
01:32:04,035 --> 01:32:06,270
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

880
01:32:06,504 --> 01:32:09,799
...but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

881
01:32:10,975 --> 01:32:13,211
You speak as one of their own.

882
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:17,416
I was raised in Rivendell...

883
01:32:17,916 --> 01:32:19,291
...for a time.

884
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,725
Turn this fellow free.

885
01:32:25,357 --> 01:32:27,813
He's seen enough of war.

886
01:32:39,571 --> 01:32:42,354
Gandalf the White.

887
01:32:42,609 --> 01:32:44,975
Gandalf the Fool!

888
01:32:46,312 --> 01:32:50,173
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

889
01:32:51,549 --> 01:32:55,346
There were three
who followed the wizard.

890
01:32:56,021 --> 01:33:01,072
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

891
01:33:01,627 --> 01:33:04,245
You stink of horse.

892
01:33:09,602 --> 01:33:11,425
The Man...

893
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:17,696
...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

894
01:33:18,011 --> 01:33:21,687
One of the Dûnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

895
01:33:22,015 --> 01:33:23,738
His cloth was poor.

896
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:29,635
And yet he bore a strange ring.

897
01:33:30,958 --> 01:33:34,252
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

898
01:33:34,561 --> 01:33:40,190
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

899
01:33:40,568 --> 01:33:42,389
The Ring of Barahir.

900
01:33:43,470 --> 01:33:46,951
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

901
01:33:47,276 --> 01:33:50,407
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

902
01:33:50,845 --> 01:33:53,364
The line was broken years ago.

903
01:33:54,949 --> 01:33:56,323
It matters not.

904
01:33:56,551 --> 01:33:59,038
The world of Men shall fall.

905
01:33:59,286 --> 01:34:01,110
It will begin at Edoras.

906
01:34:10,298 --> 01:34:12,152
I am ready, Gamling.

907
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,822
Bring my horse.

908
01:34:18,106 --> 01:34:19,350
This is not a defeat.

909
01:34:21,909 --> 01:34:23,054
We will return.

910
01:34:28,483 --> 01:34:30,872
We will return.

911
01:34:54,309 --> 01:34:56,196
You have some skill with a blade.

912
01:35:04,821 --> 01:35:06,795
Women of this country learned long ago:

913
01:35:07,023 --> 01:35:09,445
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

914
01:35:09,859 --> 01:35:11,484
I fear neither death nor pain.

915
01:35:12,929 --> 01:35:14,936
What do you fear, my lady?

916
01:35:18,368 --> 01:35:20,157
A cage.

917
01:35:21,471 --> 01:35:25,180
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

918
01:35:25,476 --> 01:35:29,250
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

919
01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:34,858
You're a daughter of kings...

920
01:35:36,186 --> 01:35:39,317
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

921
01:35:44,861 --> 01:35:47,196
I do not think that would be your fate.

922
01:36:20,332 --> 01:36:23,201
<i>Théoden will not stay at Edoras.</i>

923
01:36:23,501 --> 01:36:25,476
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

924
01:36:25,904 --> 01:36:28,686
He will expect an attack on the city.

925
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:33,141
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

926
01:36:33,445 --> 01:36:35,779
...the great fortress of Rohan.

927
01:36:37,048 --> 01:36:41,205
<i>It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.</i>

928
01:36:42,921 --> 01:36:44,448
<i>They will be slow.</i>

929
01:36:45,024 --> 01:36:49,214
They will have women and children
with them.

930
01:36:53,264 --> 01:36:55,404
Send out your Warg-riders.

931
01:37:10,349 --> 01:37:13,164
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

932
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:16,005
- Why do you do that?
- What?

933
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:18,776
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

934
01:37:19,259 --> 01:37:21,200
Because.

935
01:37:22,895 --> 01:37:24,902
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

936
01:37:25,165 --> 01:37:27,237
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

937
01:37:27,869 --> 01:37:30,388
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

938
01:37:30,804 --> 01:37:32,942
You have no idea what it did to him...

939
01:37:33,174 --> 01:37:35,474
...what it's still doing to him.

940
01:37:37,944 --> 01:37:39,918
I want to help him, Sam.

941
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:41,324
Why?

942
01:37:46,821 --> 01:37:49,787
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

943
01:37:54,127 --> 01:37:55,981
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

944
01:37:56,229 --> 01:37:58,881
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

945
01:38:05,872 --> 01:38:09,865
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

946
01:38:10,912 --> 01:38:11,992
I do.

947
01:38:14,082 --> 01:38:15,871
It's the Ring.

948
01:38:16,452 --> 01:38:17,978
You can't take your eyes off it.

949
01:38:18,853 --> 01:38:20,741
I've seen you.

950
01:38:21,223 --> 01:38:24,931
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

951
01:38:26,895 --> 01:38:28,999
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

952
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:31,882
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

953
01:38:32,134 --> 01:38:34,949
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

954
01:38:35,237 --> 01:38:36,927
Mine! My own!

955
01:38:37,873 --> 01:38:39,880
Can't you hear yourself?

956
01:38:40,109 --> 01:38:41,766
Don't you know who you sound like?

957
01:38:52,088 --> 01:38:54,094
We wants it.

958
01:38:54,323 --> 01:38:56,973
We needs it.

959
01:38:57,226 --> 01:39:01,863
Must have the precious.

960
01:39:02,231 --> 01:39:05,362
They stole it from us.

961
01:39:05,835 --> 01:39:08,998
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

962
01:39:09,271 --> 01:39:13,045
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

963
01:39:13,342 --> 01:39:16,408
No. Not master.

964
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,425
Yes, precious. False.

965
01:39:20,885 --> 01:39:25,107
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

966
01:39:26,422 --> 01:39:28,843
Master's my friend.

967
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:33,947
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

968
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:37,854
Not listening. I'm not listening.

969
01:39:38,135 --> 01:39:41,963
You're a liar and a thief.

970
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,247
No.

971
01:39:45,241 --> 01:39:48,023
Murderer.

972
01:39:50,548 --> 01:39:51,548
Go away.

973
01:39:51,882 --> 01:39:54,086
Go away?

974
01:39:56,187 --> 01:39:58,904
I hate you.

975
01:39:59,156 --> 01:40:01,392
I hate you.

976
01:40:01,926 --> 01:40:05,025
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

977
01:40:05,329 --> 01:40:07,118
I saved us.

978
01:40:07,332 --> 01:40:11,739
It was me. We survived because of me.

979
01:40:13,104 --> 01:40:16,452
Not anymore.

980
01:40:18,075 --> 01:40:19,482
What did you say?

981
01:40:21,613 --> 01:40:25,321
Master looks after us now.

982
01:40:25,617 --> 01:40:29,032
We don't need you.

983
01:40:29,954 --> 01:40:31,362
What?

984
01:40:31,556 --> 01:40:33,279
Leave now...

985
01:40:33,525 --> 01:40:37,202
...and never come back.

986
01:40:37,496 --> 01:40:38,496
No.

987
01:40:39,098 --> 01:40:43,091
Leave now and never come back.

988
01:40:45,938 --> 01:40:51,634
Leave now and never come back!

989
01:41:03,822 --> 01:41:06,277
We told him to go away.

990
01:41:06,524 --> 01:41:09,394
And away he goes, precious.

991
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:11,552
Gone! Gone! Gone!

992
01:41:11,964 --> 01:41:13,752
Sméagol is free!

993
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:20,065
Look.

994
01:41:20,273 --> 01:41:24,681
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

995
01:41:34,321 --> 01:41:35,597
They are young.

996
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:38,322
They are tender. They are nice.

997
01:41:38,557 --> 01:41:42,005
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

998
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:46,361
You'll make him sick, you will...

999
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:49,837
...behaving like that.

1000
01:41:52,272 --> 01:41:54,990
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

1001
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,840
What's it doing?

1002
01:42:01,481 --> 01:42:04,034
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1003
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:06,356
It ruins it.

1004
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:10,132
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

1005
01:42:14,429 --> 01:42:16,949
What we need is a few good taters.

1006
01:42:17,966 --> 01:42:20,867
What's taters, precious?

1007
01:42:21,169 --> 01:42:22,860
What's taters? Eh?

1008
01:42:23,071 --> 01:42:24,794
Po-ta-toes.

1009
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:28,205
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1010
01:42:29,944 --> 01:42:35,126
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1011
01:42:36,617 --> 01:42:38,439
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1012
01:42:38,987 --> 01:42:41,026
Oh, yes, we could.

1013
01:42:41,288 --> 01:42:44,704
Spoil a nice fish.

1014
01:42:46,095 --> 01:42:48,516
Give it to us raw...

1015
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:51,832
...and wriggling.

1016
01:42:52,101 --> 01:42:55,068
You keep nasty chips.

1017
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:58,114
You're hopeless.

1018
01:43:10,619 --> 01:43:12,113
Mr. Frodo?

1019
01:43:30,107 --> 01:43:32,724
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1020
01:43:32,976 --> 01:43:35,278
Servants of Sauron.

1021
01:43:36,213 --> 01:43:38,284
They are called to Mordor.

1022
01:43:38,514 --> 01:43:41,416
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

1023
01:43:41,851 --> 01:43:44,850
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1024
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:50,035
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1025
01:43:50,361 --> 01:43:55,281
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1026
01:43:55,899 --> 01:43:58,801
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1027
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:00,215
Mr. Frodo.

1028
01:44:00,872 --> 01:44:02,300
Look.

1029
01:44:06,010 --> 01:44:08,181
It's an oliphaunt.

1030
01:44:16,454 --> 01:44:19,324
No one at home will believe this.

1031
01:44:30,601 --> 01:44:32,425
Sméagol?

1032
01:45:12,945 --> 01:45:15,246
We've lingered here too long.

1033
01:45:18,351 --> 01:45:19,561
Come on, Sam.

1034
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:35,851
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1035
01:45:37,538 --> 01:45:42,425
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1036
01:45:42,943 --> 01:45:45,757
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1037
01:45:47,181 --> 01:45:50,344
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1038
01:45:50,617 --> 01:45:52,755
The enemy?

1039
01:45:54,923 --> 01:45:58,183
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1040
01:46:00,861 --> 01:46:02,803
You wonder what his name is...

1041
01:46:04,332 --> 01:46:06,470
...where he came from.

1042
01:46:08,535 --> 01:46:10,957
And if he was really evil at heart.

1043
01:46:12,807 --> 01:46:16,035
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1044
01:46:17,878 --> 01:46:20,147
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1045
01:46:22,416 --> 01:46:23,945
...in peace.

1046
01:46:27,488 --> 01:46:30,390
War will make corpses of us all.

1047
01:46:30,825 --> 01:46:32,799
Bind their hands.

1048
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:48,088
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

1049
01:46:48,373 --> 01:46:51,886
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1050
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:55,243
...that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

1051
01:46:55,814 --> 01:46:57,636
It's the beards.

1052
01:46:57,916 --> 01:46:59,922
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

1053
01:47:00,219 --> 01:47:02,968
...that there are no Dwarf women...

1054
01:47:03,255 --> 01:47:07,347
...and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

1055
01:47:09,194 --> 01:47:10,982
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

1056
01:47:17,169 --> 01:47:19,340
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1057
01:47:19,872 --> 01:47:21,847
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1058
01:47:23,809 --> 01:47:27,454
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1059
01:47:27,946 --> 01:47:30,565
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1060
01:47:30,884 --> 01:47:33,055
Cut down by Orcs.

1061
01:47:33,352 --> 01:47:36,201
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1062
01:47:36,956 --> 01:47:41,397
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1063
01:47:41,761 --> 01:47:46,136
Doomed to wait upon an old man,
who should have loved her as a father.

1064
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:58,579
Gimli.

1065
01:47:58,879 --> 01:48:00,821
No, I couldn't.

1066
01:48:01,082 --> 01:48:02,869
I really couldn't.

1067
01:48:07,454 --> 01:48:08,982
I made some stew.

1068
01:48:09,256 --> 01:48:12,387
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1069
01:48:20,334 --> 01:48:22,308
Thank you.

1070
01:48:42,891 --> 01:48:45,312
- It's good.
- Really?

1071
01:48:49,397 --> 01:48:52,627
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1072
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:57,964
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1073
01:48:58,540 --> 01:49:00,907
But he must be mistaken.

1074
01:49:01,277 --> 01:49:05,500
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1075
01:49:06,849 --> 01:49:09,882
Then you must be at least 60.

1076
01:49:12,154 --> 01:49:13,616
Seventy?

1077
01:49:14,156 --> 01:49:15,750
But you cannot be 80!

1078
01:49:19,161 --> 01:49:20,471
Eighty-seven.

1079
01:49:23,633 --> 01:49:25,641
You are one of the Dûnedain.

1080
01:49:26,802 --> 01:49:29,770
A descendant of Nûmenor,
blessed with long life.

1081
01:49:31,108 --> 01:49:33,660
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1082
01:49:34,411 --> 01:49:36,101
There are few of us left.

1083
01:49:36,345 --> 01:49:38,996
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1084
01:49:39,918 --> 01:49:43,146
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1085
01:49:57,969 --> 01:50:01,929
<i>The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.</i>

1086
01:50:02,874 --> 01:50:06,189
<i>It is mine to give to whom I will.</i>

1087
01:50:08,145 --> 01:50:10,447
<i>Like my heart.</i>

1088
01:50:12,016 --> 01:50:14,569
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

1089
01:50:14,886 --> 01:50:17,253
I am asleep.

1090
01:50:23,861 --> 01:50:25,715
This is a dream.

1091
01:50:28,032 --> 01:50:31,098
Then it is a good dream.

1092
01:50:43,182 --> 01:50:45,190
Sleep.

1093
01:51:10,343 --> 01:51:11,805
You told me once...

1094
01:51:14,348 --> 01:51:16,452
this day would come.

1095
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:20,070
This is not the end... it is the beginning.

1096
01:51:20,353 --> 01:51:22,425
You must go with Frodo.

1097
01:51:23,225 --> 01:51:25,264
That is your path.

1098
01:51:35,702 --> 01:51:38,321
My path is hidden from me.

1099
01:51:39,073 --> 01:51:42,488
It is already laid before your feet.

1100
01:51:42,810 --> 01:51:46,006
You cannot falter now.

1101
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:50,072
Arwen...

1102
01:51:52,721 --> 01:51:54,891
If you trust nothing else...

1103
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:57,300
trust this...

1104
01:51:58,626 --> 01:52:00,568
trust us.

1105
01:52:39,636 --> 01:52:41,391
Where is she?

1106
01:52:42,638 --> 01:52:44,973
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1107
01:52:48,378 --> 01:52:51,030
<i>Our time here is ending.</i>

1108
01:52:51,815 --> 01:52:54,270
Arwen's time is ending.

1109
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:56,329
Let her go.

1110
01:52:56,552 --> 01:52:58,495
Let her take the ship into the west.

1111
01:52:58,788 --> 01:53:01,691
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

1112
01:53:01,992 --> 01:53:03,748
There it will be ever green.

1113
01:53:05,328 --> 01:53:07,598
But never more than memory.

1114
01:53:08,966 --> 01:53:11,867
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

1115
01:53:12,169 --> 01:53:15,650
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1116
01:53:15,973 --> 01:53:18,177
She belongs with her people.

1117
01:53:30,721 --> 01:53:33,504
Is this how you would take your leave?

1118
01:53:33,825 --> 01:53:36,891
Did you think you could slip away at
first light - unnoticed?

1119
01:53:39,798 --> 01:53:41,937
I will not be coming back.

1120
01:53:43,034 --> 01:53:44,757
You underestimate your skill in battle.

1121
01:53:45,003 --> 01:53:46,377
You will come back.

1122
01:53:46,603 --> 01:53:48,578
It is not of death in battle that I speak.

1123
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:51,143
What do you speak of?

1124
01:53:56,449 --> 01:53:59,514
You have a chance for another life...

1125
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:05,895
away from war... grief... despair.

1126
01:54:06,591 --> 01:54:08,314
Why are you saying this?

1127
01:54:09,996 --> 01:54:13,028
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1128
01:54:14,634 --> 01:54:17,186
It was a dream, Arwen.

1129
01:54:17,736 --> 01:54:19,046
Nothing more.

1130
01:54:20,474 --> 01:54:23,572
I don't believe you.

1131
01:54:32,686 --> 01:54:34,443
This belongs to you.

1132
01:54:37,289 --> 01:54:38,817
It was a gift.

1133
01:54:41,495 --> 01:54:42,925
Keep it.

1134
01:54:45,532 --> 01:54:46,677
My lord?

1135
01:54:49,536 --> 01:54:53,912
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1136
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:18,973
What is it?

1137
01:55:20,569 --> 01:55:22,543
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.

1138
01:55:39,121 --> 01:55:41,096
Wargs!

1139
01:55:53,736 --> 01:55:55,362
A scout!

1140
01:56:01,744 --> 01:56:04,166
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1141
01:56:05,614 --> 01:56:07,719
Get them out of here!

1142
01:56:12,555 --> 01:56:14,497
All riders to the head of the column.

1143
01:56:15,292 --> 01:56:17,201
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1144
01:56:17,461 --> 01:56:19,119
Come on!

1145
01:56:31,041 --> 01:56:33,375
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1146
01:56:33,677 --> 01:56:35,083
- I can fight.
- No!

1147
01:56:37,848 --> 01:56:39,823
You must do this, for me.

1148
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:43,446
Follow me!

1149
01:56:47,025 --> 01:56:51,149
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1150
01:56:51,529 --> 01:56:54,082
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1151
01:58:06,439 --> 01:58:08,644
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1152
01:58:11,545 --> 01:58:13,007
That one counts as mine!

1153
01:58:29,797 --> 01:58:31,357
Stinking creature.

1154
01:59:58,656 --> 02:00:00,479
Aragorn!

1155
02:00:05,263 --> 02:00:06,670
Aragorn?

1156
02:00:20,745 --> 02:00:23,559
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1157
02:00:23,848 --> 02:00:25,223
He's...

1158
02:00:25,850 --> 02:00:27,377
...dead.

1159
02:00:28,086 --> 02:00:30,868
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1160
02:00:34,593 --> 02:00:35,837
You lie.

1161
02:01:09,796 --> 02:01:11,321
Get the wounded on horses.

1162
02:01:12,699 --> 02:01:15,731
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1163
02:01:16,269 --> 02:01:18,310
Leave the dead.

1164
02:01:25,846 --> 02:01:27,253
Come.

1165
02:01:37,524 --> 02:01:38,986
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1166
02:01:39,226 --> 02:01:42,009
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1167
02:01:44,664 --> 02:01:46,421
We're safe!

1168
02:01:48,001 --> 02:01:50,751
We're safe, my lady.

1169
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:52,184
Thank you.

1170
02:02:36,652 --> 02:02:37,994
- Mama!
- Éothain!

1171
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:39,649
Freda!

1172
02:02:45,461 --> 02:02:48,179
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1173
02:02:52,135 --> 02:02:53,411
Take it to the caves.

1174
02:02:53,635 --> 02:02:56,352
Make way for the king.

1175
02:02:58,340 --> 02:03:01,188
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

1176
02:03:09,252 --> 02:03:12,830
So few. So few of you have returned.

1177
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:17,931
Our people are safe.

1178
02:03:19,362 --> 02:03:21,819
We have paid for it with many lives.

1179
02:03:22,766 --> 02:03:24,228
My lady.

1180
02:03:28,005 --> 02:03:30,176
Lord Aragorn...

1181
02:03:30,441 --> 02:03:31,619
...where is he?

1182
02:03:33,711 --> 02:03:35,140
He fell.

1183
02:03:57,869 --> 02:04:00,716
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1184
02:04:01,006 --> 02:04:03,821
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1185
02:04:04,176 --> 02:04:07,144
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

1186
02:04:07,447 --> 02:04:09,934
Get them into the caves.

1187
02:04:10,948 --> 02:04:15,619
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1188
02:04:17,856 --> 02:04:21,117
<i>Helm 's Deep has one weakness.</i>

1189
02:04:21,427 --> 02:04:23,663
<i>Its outer wall is solid rock...</i>

1190
02:04:23,929 --> 02:04:26,898
<i>...but for a small culvert
at its base...</i>

1191
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:29,850
<i>...which is little more than a drain.</i>

1192
02:04:32,805 --> 02:04:36,799
How? How can fire undo stone?

1193
02:04:37,144 --> 02:04:41,454
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1194
02:04:45,285 --> 02:04:49,080
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1195
02:04:49,456 --> 02:04:52,838
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

1196
02:04:53,159 --> 02:04:55,615
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

1197
02:04:55,896 --> 02:04:57,270
Tens of thousands.

1198
02:04:57,498 --> 02:05:01,393
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1199
02:05:13,479 --> 02:05:16,448
A new power is rising.

1200
02:05:16,784 --> 02:05:19,631
Its victory is at hand.

1201
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:27,433
This night...

1202
02:05:27,963 --> 02:05:32,119
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1203
02:05:32,466 --> 02:05:35,663
March to Helm's Deep!

1204
02:05:35,970 --> 02:05:39,266
Leave none alive!

1205
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:44,299
To war!

1206
02:05:48,317 --> 02:05:52,595
There will be no dawn for Men.

1207
02:06:10,004 --> 02:06:11,979
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1208
02:06:12,241 --> 02:06:15,275
There is always smoke rising...

1209
02:06:15,612 --> 02:06:19,288
...from Isengard these days.

1210
02:06:19,715 --> 02:06:21,209
Isengard?

1211
02:06:21,518 --> 02:06:23,273
There was a time...

1212
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:27,068
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1213
02:06:27,423 --> 02:06:30,653
But now he has a mind of metal...

1214
02:06:31,462 --> 02:06:33,795
...and wheels.

1215
02:06:34,664 --> 02:06:38,974
He no longer cares for growing things.

1216
02:06:39,336 --> 02:06:41,059
What is it?

1217
02:06:46,109 --> 02:06:48,247
It's Saruman's army.

1218
02:06:48,512 --> 02:06:50,005
The war has started.

1219
02:07:28,419 --> 02:07:32,642
<i>May the grace of the Valar
protect you.</i>

1220
02:08:05,059 --> 02:08:06,880
Brego.

1221
02:08:33,087 --> 02:08:34,200
Arwen.

1222
02:08:35,622 --> 02:08:37,410
It is time.

1223
02:08:39,494 --> 02:08:43,204
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.

1224
02:08:44,065 --> 02:08:45,788
I have made my choice.

1225
02:08:52,308 --> 02:08:55,057
He is not coming back.

1226
02:08:56,611 --> 02:08:59,807
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1227
02:09:00,849 --> 02:09:03,719
There is still hope.

1228
02:09:08,023 --> 02:09:11,635
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1229
02:09:15,197 --> 02:09:18,044
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

1230
02:09:18,333 --> 02:09:20,723
...and all that you hope for
comes true...

1231
02:09:21,002 --> 02:09:25,510
...you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1232
02:09:25,975 --> 02:09:28,844
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

1233
02:09:29,145 --> 02:09:31,960
...Aragorn will die.

1234
02:09:34,918 --> 02:09:37,373
<i>And there will be no comfort
for you...</i>

1235
02:09:37,654 --> 02:09:41,647
<i>...no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.</i>

1236
02:09:44,661 --> 02:09:47,246
<i>He will come to death...</i>

1237
02:09:47,563 --> 02:09:50,019
<i>...an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...</i>

1238
02:09:50,332 --> 02:09:54,806
<i>...in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.</i>

1239
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:07,877
<i>But you, my daughter...</i>

1240
02:10:08,853 --> 02:10:13,675
<i>...you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...</i>

1241
02:10:14,057 --> 02:10:17,952
<i>...as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.</i>

1242
02:10:20,565 --> 02:10:22,867
<i>Here you will dwell...</i>

1243
02:10:23,134 --> 02:10:27,836
<i>...bound to your grief
under the fading trees...</i>

1244
02:10:29,774 --> 02:10:31,684
<i>...until all the world is changed...</i>

1245
02:10:31,943 --> 02:10:36,253
...and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1246
02:10:44,956 --> 02:10:46,036
Arwen.

1247
02:10:52,763 --> 02:10:54,934
There is nothing for you here...

1248
02:10:55,702 --> 02:10:57,709
...only death.

1249
02:11:18,590 --> 02:11:21,624
Do I not also have your love?

1250
02:11:23,329 --> 02:11:25,021
You have my love, father.

1251
02:12:31,232 --> 02:12:34,745
<i>The power of the enemy is growing.</i>

1252
02:12:35,071 --> 02:12:37,591
<i>Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...</i>

1253
02:12:37,872 --> 02:12:41,102
<i>...to destroy the people of Rohan.</i>

1254
02:12:43,311 --> 02:12:46,792
<i>Isengard has been unleashed.</i>

1255
02:12:51,253 --> 02:12:54,483
<i>The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...</i>

1256
02:12:55,758 --> 02:12:58,628
<i>...the last free kingdom of Men.</i>

1257
02:12:58,961 --> 02:13:03,150
<i>His war on this country
will come swiftly.</i>

1258
02:13:07,069 --> 02:13:10,004
<i>He senses the Ring is close.</i>

1259
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:13,656
<i>The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.</i>

1260
02:13:13,976 --> 02:13:17,872
<i>In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...</i>

1261
02:13:19,583 --> 02:13:23,292
...the quest will claim his life.

1262
02:13:23,619 --> 02:13:25,692
You know this.

1263
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:29,107
<i>You have foreseen it.</i>

1264
02:13:31,328 --> 02:13:34,644
<i>It is the risk we all took.</i>

1265
02:13:39,136 --> 02:13:43,162
<i>In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.</i>

1266
02:13:44,509 --> 02:13:48,764
<i>It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.</i>

1267
02:13:49,113 --> 02:13:54,350
<i>Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.</i>

1268
02:13:54,785 --> 02:13:58,201
<i>The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...</i>

1269
02:13:58,524 --> 02:14:02,452
<i>...take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.</i>

1270
02:14:05,029 --> 02:14:06,786
<i>It is close now.</i>

1271
02:14:07,032 --> 02:14:11,123
<i>So close to achieving its goal.</i>

1272
02:14:14,440 --> 02:14:17,888
<i>For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...</i>

1273
02:14:18,242 --> 02:14:22,204
<i>...even unto to the ending
of the world.</i>

1274
02:14:24,216 --> 02:14:25,972
<i>The time of the Elves...</i>

1275
02:14:26,251 --> 02:14:28,106
<i>...is over.</i>

1276
02:14:29,022 --> 02:14:32,468
<i>Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?</i>

1277
02:14:34,561 --> 02:14:37,691
<i>Do we let them stand alone?</i>

1278
02:14:42,367 --> 02:14:43,710
What news?

1279
02:14:43,937 --> 02:14:46,619
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1280
02:14:46,906 --> 02:14:49,656
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

1281
02:14:49,943 --> 02:14:53,805
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1282
02:14:54,148 --> 02:14:56,449
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1283
02:14:56,883 --> 02:14:58,924
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1284
02:14:59,185 --> 02:15:02,447
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1285
02:15:03,691 --> 02:15:07,107
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1286
02:15:07,428 --> 02:15:10,362
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1287
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:14,705
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1288
02:15:15,001 --> 02:15:17,555
Sauron from Mordor.

1289
02:15:19,006 --> 02:15:22,072
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

1290
02:15:22,409 --> 02:15:24,002
Gondor is weak.

1291
02:15:24,278 --> 02:15:27,278
Sauron will strike us soon.

1292
02:15:28,149 --> 02:15:29,938
And he will strike hard.

1293
02:15:30,451 --> 02:15:34,379
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1294
02:15:48,403 --> 02:15:50,542
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1295
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:53,425
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1296
02:15:53,741 --> 02:15:55,913
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1297
02:16:02,884 --> 02:16:04,543
Speak.

1298
02:16:05,721 --> 02:16:08,208
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1299
02:16:08,658 --> 02:16:11,560
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1300
02:16:12,093 --> 02:16:13,555
Your bodyguard?

1301
02:16:13,796 --> 02:16:15,519
His gardener.

1302
02:16:16,199 --> 02:16:18,109
And where is your skulking friend?

1303
02:16:19,702 --> 02:16:21,938
That gangrel creature.

1304
02:16:22,337 --> 02:16:24,226
He had an ill-favored look.

1305
02:16:26,042 --> 02:16:27,897
There was no other.

1306
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:34,317
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1307
02:16:37,754 --> 02:16:40,688
One we lost in Moria...

1308
02:16:41,892 --> 02:16:43,353
...two were my kin...

1309
02:16:43,593 --> 02:16:47,172
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1310
02:16:47,497 --> 02:16:51,240
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1311
02:16:56,406 --> 02:16:58,097
You're a friend of Boromir?

1312
02:17:00,644 --> 02:17:02,052
Yes.

1313
02:17:03,213 --> 02:17:04,228
For my part.

1314
02:17:10,823 --> 02:17:13,637
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1315
02:17:15,793 --> 02:17:17,199
Dead?

1316
02:17:17,428 --> 02:17:19,401
How? When?

1317
02:17:19,732 --> 02:17:22,284
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1318
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:26,377
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1319
02:17:29,275 --> 02:17:35,472
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1320
02:17:35,981 --> 02:17:38,948
It was cloven in two.

1321
02:17:40,685 --> 02:17:43,947
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1322
02:17:46,124 --> 02:17:47,848
He was my brother.

1323
02:18:36,877 --> 02:18:39,691
Boromir!

1324
02:18:40,380 --> 02:18:42,169
Boromir!

1325
02:18:46,486 --> 02:18:50,099
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

1326
02:18:50,425 --> 02:18:53,937
A place of light and beauty and music.

1327
02:18:54,261 --> 02:18:56,498
And so it shall be once more!

1328
02:18:59,133 --> 02:19:01,687
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1329
02:19:01,969 --> 02:19:06,160
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1330
02:19:10,145 --> 02:19:15,611
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1331
02:19:16,218 --> 02:19:18,105
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1332
02:19:18,353 --> 02:19:21,070
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1333
02:19:29,898 --> 02:19:32,550
Good speech. Nice and short.

1334
02:19:32,836 --> 02:19:35,617
Leaves more time for drinking!

1335
02:19:36,038 --> 02:19:40,065
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1336
02:19:43,713 --> 02:19:45,753
Remember today, little brother.

1337
02:19:46,049 --> 02:19:48,918
Today, life is good.

1338
02:19:53,222 --> 02:19:54,749
What?

1339
02:19:55,192 --> 02:19:56,599
He's here.

1340
02:19:59,862 --> 02:20:01,492
One moment of peace,
can he not give us that?

1341
02:20:01,665 --> 02:20:02,842
Where is he?

1342
02:20:03,066 --> 02:20:06,383
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1343
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:08,729
Father!

1344
02:20:13,644 --> 02:20:15,946
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1345
02:20:16,181 --> 02:20:19,476
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1346
02:20:21,086 --> 02:20:23,868
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1347
02:20:24,788 --> 02:20:26,992
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1348
02:20:27,257 --> 02:20:29,199
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1349
02:20:29,460 --> 02:20:31,087
Oh, too few.

1350
02:20:31,663 --> 02:20:33,964
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1351
02:20:36,267 --> 02:20:39,137
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1352
02:20:39,436 --> 02:20:41,607
That is not my intent.

1353
02:20:41,873 --> 02:20:45,484
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1354
02:20:49,047 --> 02:20:51,829
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1355
02:20:52,083 --> 02:20:54,767
...I know his uses, and they are few.

1356
02:20:55,053 --> 02:20:58,501
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1357
02:20:59,825 --> 02:21:02,159
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1358
02:21:02,428 --> 02:21:05,178
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1359
02:21:05,464 --> 02:21:09,108
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1360
02:21:11,470 --> 02:21:13,674
The One Ring.

1361
02:21:16,508 --> 02:21:20,981
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1362
02:21:21,347 --> 02:21:24,828
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1363
02:21:25,152 --> 02:21:29,113
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1364
02:21:31,122 --> 02:21:33,676
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1365
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:37,505
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

1366
02:21:37,830 --> 02:21:41,573
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1367
02:21:41,902 --> 02:21:46,987
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1368
02:21:47,374 --> 02:21:52,230
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1369
02:21:52,612 --> 02:21:54,041
He will return.

1370
02:21:54,281 --> 02:21:57,892
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1371
02:21:58,185 --> 02:22:00,641
You must go.

1372
02:22:01,956 --> 02:22:03,963
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1373
02:22:04,892 --> 02:22:10,162
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1374
02:22:10,565 --> 02:22:14,111
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1375
02:22:14,436 --> 02:22:17,282
...send me in his stead.
- You?

1376
02:22:18,574 --> 02:22:20,428
Oh, I see.

1377
02:22:20,676 --> 02:22:24,701
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

1378
02:22:25,314 --> 02:22:27,222
I think not.

1379
02:22:27,482 --> 02:22:30,232
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1380
02:22:30,551 --> 02:22:33,334
The one who will not fail me.

1381
02:22:50,539 --> 02:22:53,572
Remember today, little brother.

1382
02:23:12,094 --> 02:23:13,981
Captain Faramir!

1383
02:23:15,364 --> 02:23:17,405
We found the third one.

1384
02:23:28,978 --> 02:23:30,888
You must come with me. Now.

1385
02:23:42,192 --> 02:23:43,206
Down there.

1386
02:23:58,208 --> 02:24:00,958
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1387
02:24:11,723 --> 02:24:13,131
They wait for my command.

1388
02:24:18,697 --> 02:24:19,744
Shall I shoot?

1389
02:24:21,032 --> 02:24:23,934
<i>The rock and pool
Is nice and cool</i>

1390
02:24:24,235 --> 02:24:25,990
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1391
02:24:26,706 --> 02:24:29,553
<i>Our only wish
To catch a fish</i>

1392
02:24:29,841 --> 02:24:32,427
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1393
02:24:39,484 --> 02:24:40,826
Wait.

1394
02:24:42,388 --> 02:24:45,105
This creature is bound to me.

1395
02:24:45,858 --> 02:24:47,713
And I to him.

1396
02:24:51,063 --> 02:24:52,308
He is our guide.

1397
02:24:57,103 --> 02:24:58,445
Please...

1398
02:24:58,671 --> 02:25:00,460
...let me go down to him.

1399
02:25:11,818 --> 02:25:13,410
Sméagol.

1400
02:25:14,488 --> 02:25:16,626
Master is here.

1401
02:25:17,958 --> 02:25:19,006
Come, Sméagol.

1402
02:25:21,962 --> 02:25:24,483
Trust master. Come.

1403
02:25:27,769 --> 02:25:31,445
We must go now?

1404
02:25:31,973 --> 02:25:35,268
Sméagol, you must trust master.

1405
02:25:35,575 --> 02:25:36,917
Follow me. Come on.

1406
02:25:38,179 --> 02:25:39,640
Come.

1407
02:25:42,216 --> 02:25:43,362
Come, Sméagol.

1408
02:25:43,918 --> 02:25:45,892
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

1409
02:25:46,487 --> 02:25:47,950
Come on.

1410
02:25:52,461 --> 02:25:54,021
Don't hurt him!

1411
02:25:54,295 --> 02:25:56,914
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

1412
02:25:57,199 --> 02:25:58,442
Master!

1413
02:26:23,725 --> 02:26:25,962
That's enough.

1414
02:26:29,730 --> 02:26:31,803
Where are you leading them?

1415
02:26:33,702 --> 02:26:35,296
Answer me.

1416
02:26:36,171 --> 02:26:39,270
Sméagol.

1417
02:26:42,846 --> 02:26:47,418
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

1418
02:26:48,852 --> 02:26:51,373
Cruel Men hurts us.

1419
02:26:51,654 --> 02:26:54,524
Master tricksed us.

1420
02:26:54,859 --> 02:26:58,240
Of course he did.

1421
02:26:58,795 --> 02:27:02,308
I told you he was tricksy.

1422
02:27:02,665 --> 02:27:05,568
I told you he was false.

1423
02:27:05,869 --> 02:27:08,456
Master is our friend.

1424
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:11,008
Our friend.

1425
02:27:11,275 --> 02:27:13,348
Master betrayed us.

1426
02:27:13,611 --> 02:27:16,480
No. Not its business.

1427
02:27:17,682 --> 02:27:20,016
Leave us alone!

1428
02:27:20,285 --> 02:27:22,587
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1429
02:27:22,854 --> 02:27:25,057
They stole it from us!

1430
02:27:25,322 --> 02:27:26,696
No. No.

1431
02:27:27,325 --> 02:27:28,885
What did they steal?

1432
02:27:31,128 --> 02:27:36,245
My precious!

1433
02:27:40,105 --> 02:27:41,665
We have to get out of here.

1434
02:27:42,340 --> 02:27:44,227
You go. Go, now.

1435
02:27:46,913 --> 02:27:48,701
You can do it.

1436
02:27:50,215 --> 02:27:51,622
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1437
02:27:51,850 --> 02:27:53,574
Just this once.

1438
02:27:53,819 --> 02:27:55,509
Put it on.

1439
02:27:56,022 --> 02:27:57,964
Disappear.

1440
02:27:59,090 --> 02:28:00,138
I can't.

1441
02:28:03,262 --> 02:28:05,401
You were right, Sam.

1442
02:28:06,967 --> 02:28:09,333
You tried to tell me but...

1443
02:28:14,173 --> 02:28:16,246
I'm sorry.

1444
02:28:20,881 --> 02:28:23,630
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1445
02:28:25,152 --> 02:28:26,744
If I put it on...

1446
02:28:26,987 --> 02:28:29,224
...he'll find me.

1447
02:28:30,990 --> 02:28:32,878
He'll see.

1448
02:28:34,194 --> 02:28:36,081
Mr. Frodo...

1449
02:28:41,068 --> 02:28:45,160
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1450
02:28:47,541 --> 02:28:50,411
Here in the Wild I have you...

1451
02:28:50,711 --> 02:28:52,534
...two Halflings...

1452
02:28:52,780 --> 02:28:55,813
...and a host of men at my call.

1453
02:28:59,253 --> 02:29:02,602
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1454
02:29:12,467 --> 02:29:16,011
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

1455
02:29:17,805 --> 02:29:20,707
...to show his quality.

1456
02:29:41,931 --> 02:29:43,425
No!

1457
02:29:46,702 --> 02:29:47,979
Stop it!

1458
02:29:48,204 --> 02:29:49,204
Leave him alone.

1459
02:29:50,607 --> 02:29:52,973
Don't you understand?

1460
02:29:54,410 --> 02:29:56,232
He's got to destroy it!

1461
02:29:56,478 --> 02:29:59,578
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1462
02:29:59,883 --> 02:30:01,476
To the Mountain of Fire!

1463
02:30:02,618 --> 02:30:05,586
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1464
02:30:05,889 --> 02:30:08,759
Please. It's such a burden.

1465
02:30:11,061 --> 02:30:13,068
Will you not help him?

1466
02:30:14,497 --> 02:30:16,319
Captain?

1467
02:30:17,101 --> 02:30:19,206
Prepare to leave.

1468
02:30:24,275 --> 02:30:26,609
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1469
02:31:39,652 --> 02:31:42,173
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1470
02:31:42,455 --> 02:31:45,390
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1471
02:31:45,692 --> 02:31:49,304
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1472
02:31:49,630 --> 02:31:53,492
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1473
02:31:54,334 --> 02:31:55,763
Bless you, laddie.

1474
02:31:56,402 --> 02:31:58,061
Gimli, where is the king?

1475
02:32:07,214 --> 02:32:08,214
You're late.

1476
02:32:11,953 --> 02:32:13,229
You look terrible.

1477
02:32:54,997 --> 02:32:56,971
A great host, you say?

1478
02:32:57,233 --> 02:32:59,786
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

1479
02:33:00,569 --> 02:33:03,439
Ten thousand strong at least.

1480
02:33:05,106 --> 02:33:06,513
Ten thousand?

1481
02:33:07,008 --> 02:33:09,375
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1482
02:33:12,181 --> 02:33:14,221
To destroy the world of Men.

1483
02:33:16,819 --> 02:33:18,728
They will be here by nightfall.

1484
02:33:24,661 --> 02:33:25,905
Let them come!

1485
02:33:27,462 --> 02:33:30,114
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1486
02:33:30,400 --> 02:33:33,400
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1487
02:33:41,745 --> 02:33:44,560
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1488
02:33:44,848 --> 02:33:47,183
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1489
02:33:47,450 --> 02:33:50,067
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1490
02:33:50,353 --> 02:33:52,655
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1491
02:33:53,356 --> 02:33:55,461
These are Uruk-hai.

1492
02:33:55,726 --> 02:33:59,021
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1493
02:34:00,797 --> 02:34:04,310
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1494
02:34:04,635 --> 02:34:08,083
I know how to defend my own keep.

1495
02:34:14,878 --> 02:34:18,141
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1496
02:34:18,450 --> 02:34:23,468
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1497
02:34:23,887 --> 02:34:26,442
Crops can be resown...

1498
02:34:26,725 --> 02:34:29,595
...homes rebuilt.

1499
02:34:30,328 --> 02:34:32,783
Within these walls...

1500
02:34:33,265 --> 02:34:34,694
...we will outlast them.

1501
02:34:34,933 --> 02:34:37,234
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1502
02:34:37,502 --> 02:34:38,996
They come to destroy its people...

1503
02:34:39,172 --> 02:34:41,560
...down to the last child.

1504
02:34:42,541 --> 02:34:44,713
What would you have me do?

1505
02:34:45,011 --> 02:34:46,636
Look at my men.

1506
02:34:46,913 --> 02:34:48,571
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1507
02:34:50,849 --> 02:34:55,072
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

1508
02:34:55,420 --> 02:34:58,323
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

1509
02:35:02,094 --> 02:35:03,917
Send out riders, my lord.

1510
02:35:04,296 --> 02:35:07,046
You must call for aid.

1511
02:35:10,436 --> 02:35:12,608
And who will come?

1512
02:35:13,106 --> 02:35:14,633
Elves?

1513
02:35:14,907 --> 02:35:16,849
Dwarves?

1514
02:35:17,744 --> 02:35:20,494
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1515
02:35:21,447 --> 02:35:23,619
The old alliances are dead.

1516
02:35:24,151 --> 02:35:26,835
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1517
02:35:27,121 --> 02:35:29,226
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1518
02:35:30,289 --> 02:35:33,388
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1519
02:35:33,695 --> 02:35:35,548
Where was Gon...?

1520
02:35:38,298 --> 02:35:40,086
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1521
02:35:41,770 --> 02:35:44,136
...we are alone.

1522
02:35:51,111 --> 02:35:52,802
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1523
02:35:53,048 --> 02:35:54,419
We need more time
to lay provisions...

1524
02:35:54,481 --> 02:35:57,830
There is no time. War is upon us.

1525
02:35:58,252 --> 02:35:59,879
Secure the gate.

1526
02:36:05,161 --> 02:36:07,167
We Ents have not troubled...

1527
02:36:07,462 --> 02:36:10,691
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

1528
02:36:11,599 --> 02:36:14,447
...for a very long time.

1529
02:36:15,837 --> 02:36:20,408
But now, something
is about to happen...

1530
02:36:20,775 --> 02:36:23,012
...that has not happened...

1531
02:36:23,312 --> 02:36:25,701
...for an age.

1532
02:36:27,015 --> 02:36:29,154
Entmoot.

1533
02:36:29,717 --> 02:36:30,717
What's that?

1534
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:33,837
'Tis a gathering.

1535
02:36:35,157 --> 02:36:37,613
A gathering of what?

1536
02:36:55,645 --> 02:36:57,947
Beech. Oak.

1537
02:36:58,180 --> 02:37:00,035
Chestnut. Ash.

1538
02:37:00,383 --> 02:37:02,271
Good. Good. Good.

1539
02:37:02,519 --> 02:37:04,787
Many have come.

1540
02:37:12,429 --> 02:37:15,080
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

1541
02:37:15,366 --> 02:37:17,821
...will go to war.

1542
02:37:26,878 --> 02:37:29,812
Move back! Move to the caves!

1543
02:37:32,450 --> 02:37:34,392
Come on, people! Quicky, now!

1544
02:37:34,919 --> 02:37:37,090
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1545
02:37:37,388 --> 02:37:39,528
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1546
02:37:39,791 --> 02:37:42,789
Aragorn, you must rest.

1547
02:37:43,094 --> 02:37:45,396
You're no use to us half alive.

1548
02:37:45,963 --> 02:37:47,108
Aragorn!

1549
02:37:50,568 --> 02:37:53,471
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1550
02:37:53,772 --> 02:37:55,365
That is an honorable charge.

1551
02:37:55,607 --> 02:37:58,356
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1552
02:37:58,644 --> 02:38:00,270
What renown is there in that?

1553
02:38:00,512 --> 02:38:04,058
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1554
02:38:04,516 --> 02:38:07,166
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1555
02:38:07,486 --> 02:38:12,242
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1556
02:38:12,792 --> 02:38:15,475
You do not command
the others to stay!

1557
02:38:15,761 --> 02:38:19,373
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1558
02:38:20,700 --> 02:38:22,806
Because they love you.

1559
02:38:30,009 --> 02:38:31,471
I'm sorry.

1560
02:39:37,445 --> 02:39:40,543
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1561
02:39:41,783 --> 02:39:43,475
These are no soldiers.

1562
02:39:45,855 --> 02:39:49,150
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1563
02:39:53,262 --> 02:39:56,043
Look at them. They're frightened.

1564
02:39:56,331 --> 02:39:57,739
I can see it in their eyes.

1565
02:40:03,039 --> 02:40:04,948
And they should be...

1566
02:40:05,207 --> 02:40:08,175
Three hundred... against ten thousand!

1567
02:40:10,047 --> 02:40:12,600
They have more hope of defending
themselves here than at Edoras...

1568
02:40:13,716 --> 02:40:16,237
They cannot win this fight.

1569
02:40:17,287 --> 02:40:18,530
They are all going to die!

1570
02:40:18,788 --> 02:40:20,894
Then I shall die as one of them!

1571
02:40:27,430 --> 02:40:29,186
Let him go, lad.

1572
02:40:29,832 --> 02:40:31,721
Let him be.

1573
02:40:33,270 --> 02:40:38,506
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1574
02:40:42,946 --> 02:40:44,769
My lord?

1575
02:40:46,950 --> 02:40:49,372
Who am I, Gamling?

1576
02:40:52,889 --> 02:40:56,631
You are our king, sire.

1577
02:40:59,797 --> 02:41:02,927
And do you trust your king?

1578
02:41:04,602 --> 02:41:07,635
Your men, my lord...

1579
02:41:07,938 --> 02:41:10,623
...will follow you to whatever end.

1580
02:41:17,617 --> 02:41:19,438
To whatever end.

1581
02:41:29,395 --> 02:41:32,810
Where is the horse and the rider?

1582
02:41:33,132 --> 02:41:36,034
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1583
02:41:37,704 --> 02:41:41,895
<i>They have passed like rain
on the mountains.</i>

1584
02:41:43,076 --> 02:41:46,174
<i>Like wind in the meadow.</i>

1585
02:41:49,983 --> 02:41:53,595
The days have gone down in the West...

1586
02:41:54,454 --> 02:41:56,974
<i>...behind the hills...</i>

1587
02:41:59,024 --> 02:42:00,552
<i>...into Shadow.</i>

1588
02:42:09,102 --> 02:42:12,397
How did it come to this?

1589
02:42:33,862 --> 02:42:35,650
It's been going for hours.

1590
02:42:36,864 --> 02:42:39,134
They must have decided something
by now.

1591
02:42:39,401 --> 02:42:43,330
Decided? No.

1592
02:42:43,672 --> 02:42:48,593
We only just finished saying...

1593
02:42:50,011 --> 02:42:51,799
...good morning.

1594
02:42:53,215 --> 02:42:56,281
But it's nighttime already.

1595
02:42:56,585 --> 02:42:58,308
You can't take forever.

1596
02:42:59,387 --> 02:43:01,361
Don't be hasty.

1597
02:43:01,922 --> 02:43:04,192
We're running out of time!

1598
02:43:07,563 --> 02:43:10,409
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1599
02:43:27,851 --> 02:43:29,126
Give me your sword.

1600
02:43:38,694 --> 02:43:39,741
What is your name?

1601
02:43:40,363 --> 02:43:42,632
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

1602
02:43:44,868 --> 02:43:47,387
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.

1603
02:43:49,473 --> 02:43:51,360
They say that it is hopeless.

1604
02:44:09,259 --> 02:44:10,820
This is a good sword.

1605
02:44:12,963 --> 02:44:15,168
Haleth, son of Háma...

1606
02:44:19,638 --> 02:44:21,710
...there is always hope.

1607
02:44:44,730 --> 02:44:47,926
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1608
02:44:48,267 --> 02:44:49,728
Forgive me.

1609
02:44:50,001 --> 02:44:51,377
I was wrong to despair.

1610
02:44:54,640 --> 02:44:57,007
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

1611
02:45:00,646 --> 02:45:03,329
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1612
02:45:06,886 --> 02:45:08,861
It's a little tight across the chest.

1613
02:45:15,127 --> 02:45:17,014
That is no Orc horn.

1614
02:45:22,802 --> 02:45:24,559
Send for the king.

1615
02:45:24,805 --> 02:45:28,251
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1616
02:46:00,041 --> 02:46:01,634
How is this possible?

1617
02:46:02,711 --> 02:46:06,190
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1618
02:46:06,514 --> 02:46:09,613
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1619
02:46:10,451 --> 02:46:14,510
Long ago we fought and died together.

1620
02:46:16,958 --> 02:46:19,740
We come to honor that allegiance.

1621
02:46:28,370 --> 02:46:30,224
You are most welcome.

1622
02:46:35,678 --> 02:46:39,452
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1623
02:47:13,283 --> 02:47:16,414
You could have picked a better spot.

1624
02:47:21,425 --> 02:47:25,450
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1625
02:47:31,801 --> 02:47:33,493
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1626
02:47:34,204 --> 02:47:36,593
Let's hope they last the night.

1627
02:48:36,669 --> 02:48:40,183
Show them no mercy...

1628
02:48:41,373 --> 02:48:43,577
for you shall receive none!

1629
02:49:18,146 --> 02:49:20,828
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1630
02:49:22,215 --> 02:49:23,939
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1631
02:50:03,393 --> 02:50:04,637
HOLD!

1632
02:50:27,216 --> 02:50:28,940
So it begins.

1633
02:50:34,925 --> 02:50:36,037
Prepare to fire!

1634
02:50:45,035 --> 02:50:47,140
Their armour is weak at the neck...

1635
02:50:47,404 --> 02:50:48,833
and beneath the arm.

1636
02:50:49,106 --> 02:50:50,732
Release Arrows!

1637
02:50:55,846 --> 02:50:57,123
Did they hit anything?

1638
02:50:57,881 --> 02:50:59,790
Give them a volley.

1639
02:51:00,050 --> 02:51:02,025
- Fire!
- Fire!

1640
02:51:17,869 --> 02:51:19,494
Send them to me! Come on!

1641
02:51:39,124 --> 02:51:40,124
Ladders!

1642
02:51:40,292 --> 02:51:41,339
Good!

1643
02:51:48,167 --> 02:51:51,037
Swords! Swords!

1644
02:52:29,277 --> 02:52:31,316
Legolas! Two already!

1645
02:52:31,612 --> 02:52:33,619
I'm on 17!

1646
02:52:33,915 --> 02:52:36,337
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1647
02:52:43,223 --> 02:52:44,881
Nineteen!

1648
02:53:10,953 --> 02:53:12,327
Merry.

1649
02:53:16,792 --> 02:53:20,436
We have just agreed.

1650
02:53:30,606 --> 02:53:32,013
Yes?

1651
02:53:33,576 --> 02:53:37,569
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1652
02:53:38,915 --> 02:53:41,947
...and we have agreed...

1653
02:53:42,551 --> 02:53:46,380
...you are not Orcs.

1654
02:53:48,324 --> 02:53:50,364
Well, that's good news.

1655
02:53:50,627 --> 02:53:54,588
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1656
02:53:55,398 --> 02:53:59,043
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1657
02:53:59,369 --> 02:54:00,830
Hasty?

1658
02:54:01,672 --> 02:54:03,494
Our friends are out there.

1659
02:54:03,741 --> 02:54:07,735
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1660
02:54:08,245 --> 02:54:10,416
War? Yes.

1661
02:54:10,713 --> 02:54:12,503
It affects us all.

1662
02:54:12,783 --> 02:54:15,630
Tree, root and twig.

1663
02:54:16,654 --> 02:54:20,484
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1664
02:54:20,891 --> 02:54:22,745
...it takes a long time...

1665
02:54:22,992 --> 02:54:27,694
...to say anything in Old Entish...

1666
02:54:28,065 --> 02:54:32,123
...and we never say anything...

1667
02:54:32,469 --> 02:54:36,212
...unless it is worth taking...

1668
02:54:36,541 --> 02:54:40,371
...a long time to say.

1669
02:54:41,312 --> 02:54:44,477
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1670
02:54:44,817 --> 02:54:45,817
Nineteen!

1671
02:54:46,452 --> 02:54:48,207
Twenty!

1672
02:54:48,486 --> 02:54:50,046
Twenty-one!

1673
02:55:00,232 --> 02:55:02,142
Causeway!

1674
02:55:10,009 --> 02:55:12,277
Is this it?

1675
02:55:12,544 --> 02:55:15,360
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1676
02:55:41,842 --> 02:55:43,151
Bring him down, Legolas!

1677
02:55:46,579 --> 02:55:47,692
Kill him!

1678
02:55:47,948 --> 02:55:48,948
Kill him!

1679
02:56:41,503 --> 02:56:42,812
Brace the gate!

1680
02:57:01,190 --> 02:57:03,362
Hold them! Stand firm!

1681
02:57:11,367 --> 02:57:12,644
Aragorn!

1682
02:57:17,340 --> 02:57:18,485
Gimli!

1683
02:57:29,185 --> 02:57:30,185
Charge!

1684
02:58:07,258 --> 02:58:11,055
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1685
02:58:11,997 --> 02:58:15,859
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1686
02:58:16,834 --> 02:58:18,842
How can that be your decision?!

1687
02:58:19,604 --> 02:58:23,084
This is not our war.

1688
02:58:23,542 --> 02:58:25,647
But you're part of this world!

1689
02:58:29,881 --> 02:58:31,637
Aren't you?!

1690
02:58:35,787 --> 02:58:38,089
You must help. Please.

1691
02:58:39,391 --> 02:58:42,043
You must do something.

1692
02:58:42,462 --> 02:58:46,587
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1693
02:58:47,966 --> 02:58:51,545
But your part in this tale is over.

1694
02:58:51,871 --> 02:58:54,009
Go back to your home.

1695
02:59:04,116 --> 02:59:06,288
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1696
02:59:06,552 --> 02:59:08,341
We don't belong here, Merry.

1697
02:59:08,588 --> 02:59:10,760
It's too big for us.

1698
02:59:11,058 --> 02:59:13,579
What can we do in the end?

1699
02:59:16,029 --> 02:59:18,516
We've got the Shire.

1700
02:59:19,198 --> 02:59:21,620
Maybe we should go home.

1701
02:59:23,570 --> 02:59:26,668
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1702
02:59:26,975 --> 02:59:31,677
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1703
02:59:32,046 --> 02:59:33,573
And...

1704
02:59:35,449 --> 02:59:38,384
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1705
02:59:42,022 --> 02:59:44,838
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1706
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:05,657
Aragorn!

1707
03:00:05,881 --> 03:00:08,150
Fall back to the Keep!

1708
03:00:08,417 --> 03:00:11,383
Get your men out of there!

1709
03:00:12,655 --> 03:00:14,084
To the Keep!

1710
03:00:19,029 --> 03:00:20,522
Pull back to the Keep!

1711
03:00:21,163 --> 03:00:22,756
Haldir!

1712
03:00:23,632 --> 03:00:25,038
To the Keep!

1713
03:00:26,969 --> 03:00:30,101
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1714
03:00:49,392 --> 03:00:50,571
Haldir!

1715
03:01:33,372 --> 03:01:34,800
Brace the gate!

1716
03:01:37,108 --> 03:01:38,353
Hold them!

1717
03:01:40,178 --> 03:01:43,407
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1718
03:02:11,712 --> 03:02:13,566
Make way!

1719
03:02:16,549 --> 03:02:18,207
We cannot hold much longer!

1720
03:02:24,257 --> 03:02:27,673
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1721
03:02:28,027 --> 03:02:30,449
As long as you can give me.

1722
03:02:30,763 --> 03:02:32,323
Gimli!

1723
03:02:33,901 --> 03:02:35,177
Timbers!

1724
03:02:35,436 --> 03:02:37,323
Brace the gate!

1725
03:02:52,119 --> 03:02:53,745
Come on. We can take them.

1726
03:02:54,655 --> 03:02:56,216
It's a long way.

1727
03:03:01,528 --> 03:03:03,220
Toss me.

1728
03:03:04,465 --> 03:03:06,221
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1729
03:03:06,501 --> 03:03:07,963
You'll have to toss me!

1730
03:03:13,675 --> 03:03:14,886
Don't tell the Elf.

1731
03:03:15,476 --> 03:03:17,168
Not a word.

1732
03:03:32,495 --> 03:03:33,869
Shore up the door!

1733
03:03:34,130 --> 03:03:36,106
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1734
03:03:36,365 --> 03:03:37,379
Watch our backs!

1735
03:03:41,537 --> 03:03:43,675
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1736
03:04:33,758 --> 03:04:35,100
Hold fast the gate!

1737
03:04:39,330 --> 03:04:42,144
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1738
03:04:47,038 --> 03:04:48,533
Aragorn!

1739
03:05:22,108 --> 03:05:24,442
Pull everybody back.

1740
03:05:24,910 --> 03:05:26,634
Pull them back.

1741
03:05:27,246 --> 03:05:28,653
Fall back!

1742
03:05:28,881 --> 03:05:31,248
Fall back!

1743
03:05:32,551 --> 03:05:34,177
They have broken through!

1744
03:05:34,419 --> 03:05:36,591
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1745
03:05:36,855 --> 03:05:38,994
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1746
03:05:39,191 --> 03:05:41,679
Hurry! I nside. Get them inside!

1747
03:05:41,960 --> 03:05:44,133
I nto the Keep!

1748
03:05:55,709 --> 03:06:00,444
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1749
03:06:00,847 --> 03:06:05,354
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1750
03:06:11,292 --> 03:06:12,502
Wait! Stop!

1751
03:06:13,461 --> 03:06:14,889
Stop!

1752
03:06:18,066 --> 03:06:19,723
Turn around.

1753
03:06:20,702 --> 03:06:23,287
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1754
03:06:23,570 --> 03:06:28,359
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1755
03:06:28,943 --> 03:06:31,497
Yes. Exactly.

1756
03:06:31,813 --> 03:06:34,911
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1757
03:06:35,215 --> 03:06:37,768
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1758
03:06:38,053 --> 03:06:39,962
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1759
03:06:42,657 --> 03:06:45,558
That doesn't make sense to me.

1760
03:06:45,861 --> 03:06:46,973
But then...

1761
03:06:47,196 --> 03:06:49,780
...you are very small.

1762
03:06:50,365 --> 03:06:52,056
Perhaps you're right.

1763
03:06:54,769 --> 03:06:56,232
South it is, then.

1764
03:06:57,839 --> 03:07:01,036
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1765
03:07:03,179 --> 03:07:05,862
I always like going south.

1766
03:07:06,148 --> 03:07:10,272
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1767
03:07:11,053 --> 03:07:13,419
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1768
03:07:13,689 --> 03:07:15,544
No, we won't.

1769
03:07:16,359 --> 03:07:18,530
Not this time.

1770
03:07:25,267 --> 03:07:26,267
Look!

1771
03:07:27,938 --> 03:07:30,273
Osgiliath burns!

1772
03:07:30,540 --> 03:07:31,946
Mordor has come.

1773
03:07:33,142 --> 03:07:35,412
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1774
03:07:36,880 --> 03:07:38,986
It has only the power to destroy.

1775
03:07:39,916 --> 03:07:41,290
Please...

1776
03:07:41,518 --> 03:07:43,078
...let me go.

1777
03:07:44,187 --> 03:07:45,714
Hurry.

1778
03:07:49,259 --> 03:07:50,601
Faramir!

1779
03:07:50,828 --> 03:07:53,217
You must let me go!

1780
03:07:53,765 --> 03:07:57,061
And those little family of field mice...

1781
03:07:57,369 --> 03:08:00,085
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1782
03:08:00,937 --> 03:08:04,102
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1783
03:08:15,453 --> 03:08:18,268
Many of these trees were my friends.

1784
03:08:19,090 --> 03:08:23,531
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1785
03:08:24,896 --> 03:08:26,042
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1786
03:08:26,266 --> 03:08:28,916
They had voices of their own.

1787
03:08:31,270 --> 03:08:33,725
Saruman.

1788
03:08:34,205 --> 03:08:37,108
A wizard should know better!

1789
03:08:51,490 --> 03:08:54,970
There is no curse in Elvish...

1790
03:08:55,328 --> 03:08:57,880
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

1791
03:08:58,164 --> 03:09:00,401
...for this treachery.

1792
03:09:01,900 --> 03:09:04,618
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1793
03:09:09,443 --> 03:09:10,587
Where are they going?

1794
03:09:11,177 --> 03:09:14,276
They have business with the Orcs.

1795
03:09:14,914 --> 03:09:19,006
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1796
03:09:19,352 --> 03:09:21,872
...with rock and stone.

1797
03:09:45,880 --> 03:09:46,929
Yes.

1798
03:09:48,115 --> 03:09:49,489
Come, my friends.

1799
03:09:50,886 --> 03:09:54,911
The Ents are going to war.

1800
03:09:55,256 --> 03:09:56,948
It is likely...

1801
03:09:57,191 --> 03:10:00,575
...that we go to our doom.

1802
03:10:02,129 --> 03:10:04,495
Last march...

1803
03:10:05,134 --> 03:10:07,076
...of the Ents.

1804
03:10:55,251 --> 03:10:58,864
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1805
03:10:59,189 --> 03:11:01,130
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1806
03:11:04,027 --> 03:11:05,434
Mr. Frodo?

1807
03:11:05,796 --> 03:11:09,723
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1808
03:11:10,067 --> 03:11:12,456
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1809
03:11:26,918 --> 03:11:28,227
Take them to my father.

1810
03:11:29,886 --> 03:11:32,734
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1811
03:11:35,294 --> 03:11:38,162
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1812
03:11:39,430 --> 03:11:42,016
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1813
03:11:42,767 --> 03:11:45,418
You want to know
why your brother died?

1814
03:11:46,038 --> 03:11:49,616
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1815
03:11:49,941 --> 03:11:51,763
He tried to kill him!

1816
03:11:52,010 --> 03:11:54,247
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1817
03:11:55,147 --> 03:11:56,902
Watch out!

1818
03:12:07,925 --> 03:12:09,007
Mr. Frodo?

1819
03:12:11,697 --> 03:12:13,453
They're here.

1820
03:12:16,635 --> 03:12:19,002
They've come.

1821
03:12:21,674 --> 03:12:23,496
Nazgûl!

1822
03:12:45,665 --> 03:12:47,738
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1823
03:12:49,636 --> 03:12:51,776
Take cover!

1824
03:13:09,190 --> 03:13:10,684
The fortress is taken.

1825
03:13:11,560 --> 03:13:12,704
It is over.

1826
03:13:12,927 --> 03:13:16,702
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1827
03:13:17,031 --> 03:13:19,846
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1828
03:13:22,704 --> 03:13:24,045
They're breaking in!

1829
03:13:26,741 --> 03:13:29,131
They're past the door!

1830
03:13:32,580 --> 03:13:36,541
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1831
03:13:39,322 --> 03:13:41,176
Is there no other way?

1832
03:13:42,859 --> 03:13:45,793
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1833
03:13:46,595 --> 03:13:48,701
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1834
03:13:53,669 --> 03:13:55,970
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1835
03:13:56,239 --> 03:13:58,989
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1836
03:14:01,276 --> 03:14:04,538
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1837
03:14:09,352 --> 03:14:10,726
Ride out with me.

1838
03:14:14,924 --> 03:14:16,451
Ride out and meet them.

1839
03:14:17,327 --> 03:14:19,366
For death and glory.

1840
03:14:19,663 --> 03:14:21,005
For Rohan.

1841
03:14:22,566 --> 03:14:23,973
For your people.

1842
03:14:24,767 --> 03:14:26,623
The sun is rising.

1843
03:14:31,208 --> 03:14:34,077
<i>Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.</i>

1844
03:14:34,379 --> 03:14:35,720
<i>At dawn...</i>

1845
03:14:35,946 --> 03:14:37,572
<i>...look to the east.</i>

1846
03:14:41,785 --> 03:14:43,346
Yes.

1847
03:14:45,924 --> 03:14:47,484
Yes.

1848
03:14:48,926 --> 03:14:51,229
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1849
03:14:51,496 --> 03:14:54,178
...shall sound in the Deep...

1850
03:14:54,733 --> 03:14:56,641
...one last time.

1851
03:14:56,901 --> 03:14:58,307
Yes!

1852
03:15:01,439 --> 03:15:05,083
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1853
03:15:13,017 --> 03:15:14,294
Fell deeds, awake.

1854
03:15:15,554 --> 03:15:16,600
Now for wrath...

1855
03:15:16,821 --> 03:15:20,084
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

1856
03:15:27,298 --> 03:15:29,470
Forth Eorlingas!

1857
03:16:17,317 --> 03:16:18,495
Gandalf.

1858
03:16:25,859 --> 03:16:29,340
Théoden King stands alone.

1859
03:16:30,131 --> 03:16:32,170
Not alone.

1860
03:16:32,700 --> 03:16:33,780
Rohirrim!

1861
03:16:39,740 --> 03:16:40,853
Éomer.

1862
03:16:41,076 --> 03:16:43,496
To the king!

1863
03:18:01,226 --> 03:18:02,915
Yes!

1864
03:18:12,168 --> 03:18:15,464
A hit. A fine hit.

1865
03:18:40,131 --> 03:18:42,499
Break the dam!

1866
03:18:42,768 --> 03:18:46,063
Release the river!

1867
03:19:13,533 --> 03:19:16,151
Pippin! Hold on!

1868
03:19:21,574 --> 03:19:24,389
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1869
03:20:05,820 --> 03:20:07,763
What are you doing?

1870
03:20:16,431 --> 03:20:17,925
Where are you going?

1871
03:21:16,159 --> 03:21:17,436
It's me.

1872
03:21:19,996 --> 03:21:22,101
It's your Sam.

1873
03:21:26,536 --> 03:21:29,090
Don't you know your Sam?

1874
03:21:46,857 --> 03:21:50,087
I can't do this, Sam.

1875
03:21:51,129 --> 03:21:53,039
I know.

1876
03:21:54,132 --> 03:21:56,400
It's all wrong.

1877
03:21:57,236 --> 03:21:59,177
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1878
03:22:06,711 --> 03:22:08,718
But we are.

1879
03:22:15,220 --> 03:22:18,123
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1880
03:22:18,423 --> 03:22:20,725
The ones that really mattered.

1881
03:22:21,861 --> 03:22:24,730
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1882
03:22:25,030 --> 03:22:27,878
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

1883
03:22:28,200 --> 03:22:31,015
...because how could the end be happy?

1884
03:22:33,705 --> 03:22:35,779
<i>How could the world go back
to the way it was...</i>

1885
03:22:36,076 --> 03:22:39,336
<i>...when so much bad had happened?</i>

1886
03:22:40,347 --> 03:22:42,169
Victory!

1887
03:22:42,415 --> 03:22:43,908
We have victory!

1888
03:22:44,150 --> 03:22:47,924
<i>But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...</i>

1889
03:22:48,254 --> 03:22:49,532
<i>...this shadow.</i>

1890
03:22:49,756 --> 03:22:52,057
<i>Even darkness must pass.</i>

1891
03:22:52,325 --> 03:22:54,911
<i>A new day will come.</i>

1892
03:22:55,195 --> 03:22:58,992
<i>And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.</i>

1893
03:23:01,068 --> 03:23:03,338
<i>Those were the stories
that stayed with you...</i>

1894
03:23:03,604 --> 03:23:05,295
<i>...that meant something.</i>

1895
03:23:05,539 --> 03:23:07,995
<i>Even if you were too small
to understand why.</i>

1896
03:23:09,509 --> 03:23:13,219
<i>But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.</i>

1897
03:23:13,548 --> 03:23:15,041
<i>I know now.</i>

1898
03:23:15,949 --> 03:23:18,055
Folk in those stories...

1899
03:23:18,319 --> 03:23:22,280
...had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1900
03:23:22,624 --> 03:23:24,762
They kept going...

1901
03:23:25,526 --> 03:23:28,657
...because they were holding
on to something.

1902
03:23:30,397 --> 03:23:32,602
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1903
03:23:44,612 --> 03:23:48,387
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1904
03:23:48,816 --> 03:23:51,337
And it's worth fighting for.

1905
03:24:18,379 --> 03:24:22,504
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1906
03:24:23,420 --> 03:24:27,194
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1907
03:24:27,557 --> 03:24:29,662
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1908
03:24:34,130 --> 03:24:35,472
Then it is forfeit.

1909
03:24:38,268 --> 03:24:39,926
Release them.

1910
03:24:52,082 --> 03:24:54,057
Stay out of the forest!

1911
03:24:54,318 --> 03:24:56,041
Keep away from the trees!

1912
03:25:46,906 --> 03:25:48,629
Final count...

1913
03:25:48,874 --> 03:25:51,657
...42.
- Forty-two?

1914
03:25:53,245 --> 03:25:57,850
That's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

1915
03:25:58,850 --> 03:26:02,364
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1916
03:26:06,627 --> 03:26:09,791
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

1917
03:26:10,696 --> 03:26:13,086
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1918
03:26:13,367 --> 03:26:17,874
...because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

1919
03:26:20,274 --> 03:26:24,781
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

1920
03:26:25,245 --> 03:26:28,629
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

1921
03:26:28,983 --> 03:26:31,829
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1922
03:26:32,118 --> 03:26:34,836
I hear the staff are very good.

1923
03:26:40,628 --> 03:26:42,897
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1924
03:26:43,164 --> 03:26:47,256
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1925
03:26:47,602 --> 03:26:48,779
I'm starving.

1926
03:26:49,003 --> 03:26:51,970
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

1927
03:26:52,273 --> 03:26:55,207
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1928
03:27:19,334 --> 03:27:21,637
Saruman's storeroom!

1929
03:27:22,905 --> 03:27:23,905
South Farthing

1930
03:27:24,072 --> 03:27:26,691
I don't believe it.

1931
03:27:26,976 --> 03:27:28,950
It can't be.

1932
03:27:29,646 --> 03:27:32,427
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

1933
03:27:33,883 --> 03:27:36,087
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1934
03:27:36,552 --> 03:27:39,422
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1935
03:27:39,756 --> 03:27:40,836
Wait.

1936
03:27:41,624 --> 03:27:42,802
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

1937
03:27:43,026 --> 03:27:44,455
Share it?

1938
03:27:46,396 --> 03:27:48,698
No. No.

1939
03:27:50,300 --> 03:27:51,576
Dead plant and all that.

1940
03:27:52,068 --> 03:27:54,141
Don't think he'd understand.

1941
03:27:55,505 --> 03:27:57,611
Could be a distant relative.

1942
03:27:58,475 --> 03:28:00,897
I get it.

1943
03:28:01,177 --> 03:28:03,861
Don't be hasty.

1944
03:28:05,115 --> 03:28:06,773
Exactly.

1945
03:28:07,952 --> 03:28:10,123
Bar-hrum.

1946
03:28:35,847 --> 03:28:37,091
This is the old sewer.

1947
03:28:37,316 --> 03:28:40,250
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1948
03:28:40,552 --> 03:28:42,210
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1949
03:28:43,387 --> 03:28:45,756
Captain Faramir...

1950
03:28:46,491 --> 03:28:48,247
...you have shown your quality, sir.

1951
03:28:50,830 --> 03:28:52,073
The very highest.

1952
03:28:52,632 --> 03:28:55,152
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

1953
03:28:55,434 --> 03:28:58,248
...where gardeners are held in high honor.

1954
03:28:59,572 --> 03:29:01,459
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1955
03:29:02,140 --> 03:29:03,633
Gollum says there's a path...

1956
03:29:03,875 --> 03:29:07,649
...near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

1957
03:29:08,281 --> 03:29:09,939
Cirith Ungol?

1958
03:29:13,553 --> 03:29:16,008
- Is that its name?
- No.

1959
03:29:16,289 --> 03:29:17,882
No!

1960
03:29:18,825 --> 03:29:21,673
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1961
03:29:22,195 --> 03:29:25,577
...they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1962
03:29:26,632 --> 03:29:29,054
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

1963
03:29:29,502 --> 03:29:35,514
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

1964
03:29:37,277 --> 03:29:39,000
I must.

1965
03:29:42,583 --> 03:29:45,997
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1966
03:29:46,319 --> 03:29:48,261
Thank you.

1967
03:30:00,200 --> 03:30:04,160
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

1968
03:30:16,785 --> 03:30:18,279
Come on, keep up.

1969
03:30:21,823 --> 03:30:24,473
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

1970
03:30:25,261 --> 03:30:27,017
You know that, don't you?

1971
03:30:27,896 --> 03:30:29,359
He was trying to save you, see?

1972
03:30:29,965 --> 03:30:31,394
Save me?

1973
03:30:31,833 --> 03:30:33,905
So there's no hard feelings.

1974
03:30:34,170 --> 03:30:39,026
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

1975
03:30:39,408 --> 03:30:41,928
Gollum, Gollum.

1976
03:30:43,078 --> 03:30:44,769
Yes, master.

1977
03:30:45,915 --> 03:30:48,632
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

1978
03:30:48,918 --> 03:30:51,121
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

1979
03:30:56,760 --> 03:31:01,745
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1980
03:31:09,104 --> 03:31:11,974
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1981
03:31:12,776 --> 03:31:16,159
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1982
03:31:21,450 --> 03:31:24,745
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

1983
03:31:25,889 --> 03:31:28,987
<i>...somewhere in the wilderness.</i>

1984
03:31:32,430 --> 03:31:35,690
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1985
03:31:35,999 --> 03:31:37,308
What?

1986
03:31:37,534 --> 03:31:41,277
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

1987
03:31:41,606 --> 03:31:44,736
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1988
03:31:45,041 --> 03:31:47,857
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1989
03:31:48,145 --> 03:31:49,737
"Yes, my boy.

1990
03:31:49,981 --> 03:31:53,625
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1991
03:31:53,951 --> 03:31:56,373
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1992
03:31:56,654 --> 03:31:58,476
"Samwise the Brave."

1993
03:31:58,722 --> 03:32:01,341
I want to hear more about Sam.

1994
03:32:05,797 --> 03:32:08,643
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1995
03:32:10,134 --> 03:32:13,997
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1996
03:32:15,275 --> 03:32:16,583
So was I.

1997
03:32:25,517 --> 03:32:28,103
"Samwise the Brave."

1998
03:32:32,490 --> 03:32:33,768
Sméagol?

1999
03:32:34,027 --> 03:32:36,808
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

2000
03:32:37,095 --> 03:32:38,950
Master.

2001
03:32:39,197 --> 03:32:41,980
Master looks after us.

2002
03:32:42,869 --> 03:32:45,551
Master wouldn't hurt us.

2003
03:32:45,837 --> 03:32:48,205
Master broke his promise.

2004
03:32:48,475 --> 03:32:50,547
Don't ask Sméagol.

2005
03:32:50,810 --> 03:32:53,876
Poor, poor Sméagol.

2006
03:32:54,180 --> 03:32:56,897
Master betrayed us.

2007
03:32:57,183 --> 03:33:00,151
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

2008
03:33:00,453 --> 03:33:04,196
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

2009
03:33:04,525 --> 03:33:07,143
Kill him! Kill him!

2010
03:33:07,428 --> 03:33:08,857
Kill them both!

2011
03:33:09,128 --> 03:33:12,576
And then we take the precious...

2012
03:33:12,932 --> 03:33:16,282
...and we be the master!

2013
03:33:17,136 --> 03:33:19,689
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

2014
03:33:19,974 --> 03:33:22,528
Eyes always watching.

2015
03:33:22,810 --> 03:33:26,225
Then we stabs them out.

2016
03:33:26,548 --> 03:33:30,858
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

2017
03:33:31,219 --> 03:33:34,535
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2018
03:33:34,855 --> 03:33:37,440
Kill them both.

2019
03:33:37,725 --> 03:33:40,061
Yes. No! No!

2020
03:33:40,329 --> 03:33:43,906
It's too risky. It's too risky.

2021
03:33:44,766 --> 03:33:47,221
Where is he? Where has he gone?

2022
03:33:47,535 --> 03:33:50,023
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Sméagol?

2023
03:33:50,305 --> 03:33:55,487
We could let her do it.

2024
03:33:56,679 --> 03:34:00,640
Yes. She could do it.

2025
03:34:00,983 --> 03:34:05,358
Yes, precious, she could.

2026
03:34:05,720 --> 03:34:11,504
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

2027
03:34:12,695 --> 03:34:15,412
Once they're dead.

2028
03:34:19,969 --> 03:34:23,515
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

2029
03:34:23,839 --> 03:34:25,813
Sméagol will show you the way.

2030
03:34:26,075 --> 03:34:28,214
Follow me.
