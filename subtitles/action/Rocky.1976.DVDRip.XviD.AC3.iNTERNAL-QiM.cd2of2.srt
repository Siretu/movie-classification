1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,152
You need someone to help with
the exercise, stand by with a towel...

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,918
...run errands.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,875
Who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.
I think I'm gonna train myself, you know?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,710
Without such good people around to help,
you don't have such a good chance.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,638
Einstein flunked outta school. Twice.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,955
- That so?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,359
Beethoven was deaf, Helen Keller was
blind. I think Rocky's got a good chance.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,635
- Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?
- You lookin' to do a good deed?

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,479
Keep outta my freakin' life!

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,796
- What did I do?
- Nothin'.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,639
- Did I say something?
- You didn't say nothin'.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,833
That's right, you didn't say nothin'!
Nothin' at all!

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,356
I gotta go.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,275
Where's the freakin' pretzels?

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,709
Goddamn the pretzels!
Hey, we don't have any beer!

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,196
I thought you were supposed
to pick up some beer!

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,716
How'd you like hearin'
your name on TV tonight?

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,354
I was shocked. Why'd you do that?

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,189
- Come on, you're puttin' me on, right?
- Absolutely.

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,949
- What time should I expect you?
- Oh, about seven.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,036
Hey.

22
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,916
Hey.

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,350
You know I said that stuff on TV
didn't bother me none?

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,436
Yeah?

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,036
It did.

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,796
Listen, the reason I've
brought you here is because...

27
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,229
Have you got money
for trainin' expenses?

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,148
- I got a few dollars, you know?
- Well, here. Put this in your glove.

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,636
- What's this?
- 500 bucks. Don't worry about it.

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,633
You ain't never had any luck, but this time
Lady Luck may be in your corner.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,638
- What do ya think?
- Maybe. Maybe...

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,834
- Hey, thanks for the money, Tony.
- It's OK. Don't worry about it. See ya.

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,359
- Wait a minute.
- What?

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,233
- You're in trainin'. Huh? Come on.
- Hey.

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,756
- Yo, Tony?
- What?

36
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,871
You gonna show up at the fight?

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,116
- Ringside.
- Hey, hey!

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,676
I'll see ya.

39
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,636
<i>(Rocky) Yeah!</i>

40
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,596
Hello, kid. I seen your light.
Can I come in?

41
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,790
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Good!

42
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,559
Hey, this is a nice place here.

43
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,717
Anyway, what I come to tell you
is that, uh...

44
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,997
...that what happened to you is freak luck.

45
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,157
- Yeah, freak luck.
- Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.

46
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,955
They're good fighters.
They're colourful, they got good records.

47
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,310
They fight their guts out for peanuts.

48
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,353
But you... you got a shot at the title.

49
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,870
- Freak luck is a strange thing.
- Yeah, sure it is. Can I sit down?

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,309
Yeah, sure.

51
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,796
- What the hell are those?
- Oh, they're domestic turtles.

52
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,390
The one on top is Cuff and
the other is Link. The rest are marbles.

53
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,830
Yeah? They make good soup, do they?

54
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,396
Anyway, look, I'm here to warn ya...

55
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,798
...that you gotta be very careful
about this shot that you got at the title.

56
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,755
Because, I don't know, like the Bible says,
you ain't gonna get a second chance.

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,831
- Yeah, all right.
- You thought of that, huh?

58
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,997
Well, what you need is a manager.

59
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,956
A manager. Listen to me.

60
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,516
I know, because I've been
in this racket for 50 years.

61
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,757
- 50 years, huh?
- 50 years. God, I've seen it all.

62
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,519
All of it. You know what I done?

63
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,074
- What?
- I have done it all.

64
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,749
You shoulda seen me when
I knocked Giny Russel outta the ring.

65
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,759
Outta the goddamn ring, I tell ya.
September 14, 1923.

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,759
And it was the same night that
Firpo knocks Dempsey outta the ring.

67
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,792
- The same night. Who gets the publicity?
- Dempsey.

68
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,115
- That's right, but why?
- Cos he was champ.

69
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,232
No! Because he had a manager.

70
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,874
I had nothin', man.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,436
I wanna show you somethin'.
Look at my face for a minute. Look.

72
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,270
I got 21 stitches over this left eye.
I got 34 stitches over this eye.

73
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,756
You know what?
I had my nose busted 17 times.

74
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,873
The last time was with
that fight with Sailor Mike.

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,878
I got the clippin' here. A good fight.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,831
Read that.

77
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,916
Well, it doesn't matter.

78
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,112
Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.

79
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,392
Ah, Rocky Marciano!

80
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,433
You know, you kinda remind me
of the Rock, do you know that?

81
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,030
- You really think so?
- That's right. You move like him.

82
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,116
And you got heart, like he did.

83
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,357
Yeah, I got heart,
but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?

84
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,514
Uh... anyway, you know...

85
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,518
...when I begun in this business, kid...

86
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,156
Look, I wanna make a suggestion.
Don't drink that piss before a fight.

87
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,875
It's no good for ya.
You don't mind my sayin'...?

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,437
Anyway, when I started this racket,
pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.

89
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,032
For $10, you gotta tear somebody's throat
out. But I never had no management.

90
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,236
One time, this son of a bitch
that I fought, he put a nail right there.

91
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,430
- In his thumb?
- Yeah, in the glove.

92
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,915
And he punched
so many holes in my face...

93
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,955
...I had this spit shootin' outta my cheeks.
Can you imagine that?

94
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,436
When I tell you what I looked like
when I was in my prime...

95
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,313
I want ya to look at somethin'.
Will ya look at that?

96
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,433
That's the way I looked
before these guys got at me.

97
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,950
That's nice.
You don't take care of the picture, though.

98
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,993
Well, I never had no management.
That was the trouble.

99
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,511
Now I got all this knowledge.
I got it up here and I wanna give it to you.

100
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,031
I wanna take care of you. I wanna make
sure all this shit that happened to me...

101
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,675
...doesn't happen to you.
You know what I mean?

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,429
- The fight's set.
- Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.

103
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,109
- You follow that, do you?
- The fight's set. I don't need no manager.

104
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,631
But you can't buy what I'm gonna give ya.
I've got pain and I've got experience.

105
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,797
I got pain and I got experience too.

106
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,435
- Now listen, kid...
- Hey, yo. Hey, Mick.

107
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,439
I needed your help about ten years ago.
You never helped me none.

108
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,632
- You didn't care.
- Well, if you wanted help...

109
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,639
I say, if you wanted help,
why didn't you just ask me, kid?

110
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,116
Look, I asked,
but you never heard nothin'!

111
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,196
Well, I...

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,956
I, uh...

113
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,115
I'm 76 years old.

114
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,116
And, uh...

115
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,516
Ah, shit.

116
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,433
Took you long enough to get here.

117
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,236
Ten years to come to my house. What's
the matter? You don't like my house?

118
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,590
My house stink?

119
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,950
That's right. It stinks!

120
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,389
I didn't ask no favours from you!

121
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,511
Don't throw it around!

122
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,873
<i>Talkin' about your prime.
What about my prime, Mick?</i>

123
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,635
At least you had a prime!

124
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,709
I ain't had no prime! I ain't had nothin'!
Legs are goin', everything's goin'!

125
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,834
Guy offers me a fight. Big deal! Wanna
fight the fight? Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.

126
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,350
I'm gonna go and fight that big fight.
I'm gonna get that!

127
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,119
I'm gonna get that!

128
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,993
And you wanna be ringside and see it?
Do ya?

129
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,033
You wanna help me out? Huh? Do you
wanna see me get my face kicked in?

130
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,836
Legs ain't workin', nothing's workin'!
They go "Go on, fight the champ!"

131
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,916
Yeah, I'll fight him.

132
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,719
Get my face kicked in.

133
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,789
You come around here! You wanna move
in with me? Come on in! It's a nice house!

134
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,878
Real nice! Come on in and move! It stinks!

135
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,995
This whole place stinks!

136
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,637
You wanna help me out?
Well, help me out!

137
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,638
Come on! Help me out! I'm standin' here!

150
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,199
<i>Ha! We got Mrs Kramer up
and it's a good morning.</i>

151
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,359
<i>Boy, I need somethin' to struggle with.
28° - it's cold out there.</i>

152
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,554
<i>We've been getting away with murder
for weeks. Our high today could be 30.</i>

153
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,229
<i>Tonight we're back down in the 20° range,
colder in the suburbs.</i>

154
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,069
<i>And tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,
we may hit 40 somewhere.</i>

155
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,671
<i>But it's awfully chilly. Make sure you
have it bundled up before you bring it out.</i>

156
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,392
Come on. It stinks... Hey, come on!
It stinks in here, you know?

157
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,476
Yeah, I know.

158
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,839
Hey, do you kill all these things?

159
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,315
No, across the street.

160
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,553
This place looks like an animal morgue,
you know?

161
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,638
- It's a little cold in here, ain't it?
- Yeah.

162
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,435
Who killed all these things?

163
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,950
- What, are you crazy?
- Pay Gazzo or you end up on a hook.

164
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,389
Hey, Gazzo's a good man. You know that.

165
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,958
Hey, don't get excited. I know that. That's
why I want you to talk to him about me.

166
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,469
I can get me out of this stinkin' freezer.

167
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,879
Why don't you do yourself a favour?
Keep this job, because you eat better.

168
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,753
Moo... Does it ever snow in here?

169
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,199
Uh, you and my sister.
How are you gettin' along together?

170
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,116
How you think?

171
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,073
Uh, I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?

172
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,599
- About what?
- What's the story? What's happening?

173
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,678
- You really like her?
- Sure I like her.

174
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,350
I don't see it. What's the attraction?

175
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,790
I don't know. It fills gaps, I guess.

176
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,913
- What's "gaps"?
- I don't know. She's got gaps, I got gaps.

177
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,634
Together we fill gaps. I don't know...

178
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,990
You ballin' her?

179
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,473
Hey!

180
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,558
Hey, you don't talk dirty about your sister.

181
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,315
You screwin' my sister?

182
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,670
You see? That's why I can't
connect you with Gazzo, Paulie.

183
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,839
Because you got a big mouth, you know?
You just talk too much.

184
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,033
<i>- It's gettin' cold in here. I'm goin' home.
- Cold in here?! It is cold in here!</i>

185
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,357
It stinks in here! And you stink!

186
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,910
<i>(cracking)</i>

187
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,600
You're breakin' the ribs.

188
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,792
If you do that to Apollo Creed,
they'll put us in jail for murder.

189
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll see you tomorrow mornin', OK?

190
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,514
- I turned the heat up.
- Thanks.

191
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,395
You know, your brother's a good man,
but he's awful pushy, you know?

192
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,636
- You want me to rub you down?
- No, I'm just sore, OK? I'll just sit here.

193
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,115
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

194
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,238
Hey, come on. No foolin' around, all right?

195
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,237
I'm tired.

196
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,316
Hey, Adrian, I'm serious now.

197
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,319
There's no foolin' around durin' trainin'.
I wanna stay strong.

198
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,398
- You're not kiddin'.
- No, I ain't kiddin'.

199
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,871
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

200
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,594
Why don't you just make the meat, OK?

201
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,550
OK, I'll make the meat.

202
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,156
Yo.

203
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,348
- It's OK.
- I'm sorry.

204
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,436
Hey.

205
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,356
Hey, c'mon.

206
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,196
C'mon.

207
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,910
Underneath. Underneath.

208
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,759
Underneath! Underneath! Come on!

209
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,348
Rock, hold it, hold it.
Hold it, Rock, will ya?

210
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,029
You're drivin' me crazy,
you're so sloppy. You're off balance.

211
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,950
Let's try this. Take this string. Tie it
to both ankles. Leave two feet of slack.

212
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,709
- I ain't never had good footwork.
- Never mind. You're off balance.

213
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,755
Marciano... He had the same problem
and this string cured it.

214
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,112
The idea is that if you can move
and hit without breakin' the string...

215
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,949
...you got balance. You become
a dangerous person. You follow?

216
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,514
- You're lookin' good, Rock.
- Thanks.

217
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,358
That's it. Underneath!

218
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,869
Hey, Rock, how about an autograph?

219
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,152
Get outta here! Don't you ever interrupt
me while I'm conductin' business.

220
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,874
Move your little chicken asses out.

221
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,788
Listen, kid. You...
You lay off that pet-shop dame.

222
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,229
Women weaken legs.

223
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,632
- Yeah, but I really like this girl...
- Then let her train ya!

224
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,118
- OK, no more foolin' around.
- OK, now hit it.

225
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,953
Women weaken legs, huh?

226
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,115
- Yo, Rock!
- Yo, Rocky!

227
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,275
Yo!

228
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,789
- Yo!
- Yo, you look great.

229
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,309
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Terrific.

230
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,715
I mean, you're gonna be a heartbreaker.

231
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,674
You'll walk down the street,
breakin' hearts. Very sharp.

232
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,598
- I got another surprise for you.
- What?

233
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,951
Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus,
gimme a kiss! Come here!

234
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,390
<i>- To keep you company when you run.
- (Rocky howls)</i>

236

Come and meet the family.
The owner never come back?

237
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,793
- He's yours if you want him.
- Boy, do I want him!

238
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,673
- What's he eat, this dog?
- He eats little turtles.

239
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,950
Yo, Butkus!

240
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,875
What's that, Butkus, huh?
Whose truck is this? C'mon.

241
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,720
One call from me, you're a celebrity.

242
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,398
- You need exposure.
- Don't breathe on me, Paulie.

243
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,080
That's the big time...
I know about these things.

244
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,556
- What do these guys want from me, huh?
- To watch you train.

245
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,433
Hey, what is the matter with you?
This is private.

246
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,791
- I'm doin' you a favour.
- No, you're embarrassin' me...

247
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,832
...in front of everybody,
in front of your sister.

248
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,669
You see this cigar? Stick it in your ear.
Don't do these things to me.

249
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,918
You shoulda called me up or somethin'.
Leave a message. Don't do that!

250
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,395
My sister really likes you.

251
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,795
- I'm gonna kill you one of these days!
- Come on, come on.

252
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,876
- Pretty...
- Baby.

253
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,312
Here he is, the next heavyweight
champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!

254
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,557
Rocky Balboa, we wanna get
a brief interview in with you.

255
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,159
- What about me?
- What about you?

256
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,555
- In charge of the meat.
- Stand behind it.

257
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,830
Listen, just settle down. Just relax.

258
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,554
What we're going to do
is ask you a few questions...

259
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,069
...about your unique training method.

260
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,795
Talk to the folks at home.
They wanna know how you got into this.

261
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,516
This isn't an everyday thing. Jimmy,
you guys ready? Rocky, turn around here.

262
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,599
- Just don't take no cheap shots.
- No, I won't do that. Just relax.

263
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,918
Today we're here with heavyweight
challenger Rocky Balboa. The reason...

264
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,112
Hey, freak guy's stickin' his face in.

265
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,071
Let's try it again, Rocky.

266
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,872
<i>Today we're with heavyweight
challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>

267
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,309
<i>The reason we're in this refrigerated box...</i>

268
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,352
<i>... is that Mr Balboa has
an unusual method of training.</i>

269
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,995
<i>In a moment, he's going to
demonstrate that for viewers at home.</i>

270
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,874
<i>But first, Rocky,
how did you come to train in an icebox?</i>

271
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,276
<i>Uh, well, my friend,
the guy over there, he let me in one day.</i>

272
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,356
<i>I hit the beef and I kinda liked it.</i>

273
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,870
<i>Since I've become a challenger,
the owner don't mind neither.</i>

274
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,913
<i>Is this a common training method?
Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>

275
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,989
<i>- No, I think I invented it.
- Would you give us a demonstration?</i>

276
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,476
<i>(Apollo) And be sure
to fly my barber to Philly.</i>

277
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,840
How much is going to
West Coast advertising?

278
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,190
- $300,000.
- Make it 450.

279
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,356
Send the mayor's wife 200 roses...

280
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,278
...and make sure we get
a picture for the newspapers.

281
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,198
Do you want to run
15 radio spots in the Midwest?

282
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,880
You could spend better
in Canadian publicity.

283
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,949
Either way, I've got friends in Toronto
who could get you good tax breaks.

284
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,435
George, I like your friends.

285
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,068
Hey, champ, you oughta come and look
at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.

286
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,351
- Looks like he means business.
- Yeah, I mean business too.

287
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,634
- Hey, Shirley, we got any more coffee?
- Certainly, Mr Creed. I'll get you some.

288

290

Don't be mad at him. He's tryin' to help.

292
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,990
Adrian, I ain't mad. It's just that when
reporters are around, I get out of joint.

293
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,998
They take cheap shots. Paulie knows that.

294
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,157
Paulie keeps askin' me
for a job all the time...

295
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,999
...but he don't know nothin' about fightin'.

296
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,112
Are you gonna say anything to him?

297
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,994
What's to say?
I just don't know what he wants from me.

298
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,314
I don't want nothin' from you.

299
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,438
I don't want nothin' from you.

300
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,235
This ain't no charity case.
Get outta my house!

301
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,954
<i>It's not just your house.</i>

302
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,914
He's no friend no more.
Get outta my house, I just said.

303
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,033
- Don't talk to him like that.
- Both of ya, get outta my house!

304
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,709
Yo... it's cold outside, Paulie.

305
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,196
I don't want ya messin' her.

306
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,675
I don't raise ya to go with this scumball!

307
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,155
Yeah?! C'mon!
You wanna hit on me? C'mon!

308
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,398
I'll break both your arms,
so they don't work for ya!

309
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,079
I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo?
That's what I think of Gazzo!

310
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,318
Now you're a big-shot fighter on your way
up, you don't even throw me a crumb!

311
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,911
When I go and get you meat every
mornin'! I even give you my sister, too!

312
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,316
- Only a pig would say that!
- I'm a pig?

313
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,829
A pig gets you the best?

314
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,396
I'm a loser!
I don't get married because of you!

315
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,790
You can't live by yourself!

316
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,357
I put you two together, and you...
don't you ever forget it! You owe me!

317
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,231
- You owe me!
- What do I owe you?

318
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,669
You're supposed to be good to me.

319
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,190
What do I owe you, Paulie?
What do I owe ya?

320
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,836
I treat you good. I cook for you, I clean
for you, I pick up your dirty clothes!

321
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,919
I take care of you, Paulie!
I don't owe you nothin'!

322
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,989
And you made me feel like
a loser! I'm not a loser!

323
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,395
- You're busted!
- What?!

324
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,195
You're not a virgin!
You let a man take down your pants!

325
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,153
<i>She's busted! (whimpers)</i>

326
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,878
I can't haul meat no more.

327
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,800
You want a roommate?

328
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,239
Absolutely.

329
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,469
OK, now when you walk into the ring
with the No.1 heavyweight of the world...

330
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,909
...you'll be ready, won't ya? Why?

331
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,113
Because I've waited
for 50 years to make ya ready.

332
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,674
You'll be able to spit nails, kid.

333
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,998
Like the guy says, you're gonna eat
lightning and you're gonna crap thunder!

334
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,953
You're gonna become
a very dangerous person.

335
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,992
- Yo, Mickey!
- Hey! Oh, Rock.

336
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,112
I want ya to meet our cut man here,
Al Salvani.

337
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,993
- Take a look at his eye, kid.
- How you doin', Al?

338
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,953
- Not bad. I've seen worse.
- You ain't so bad yourself.

339
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,753
<i>- Cover up. Things'll be OK.
- You cover up.</i>

340
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,510
- Go and take a shower, will ya?
- OK, Mick. I'll see ya's tomorrow.

341
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,394
- Hey, you covered that Whitmore fight.
- That's why he won.

342
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,273
Listen, we got a winner here.
We got a chance.

343
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,358
He goes to the body
like nobody you've ever seen.

344
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,438
You just stand by for him.
We're gonna win.

345
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,320
Hey, Rocky. It's OK I talk to ya?

346
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,395
OK you talk to me? Sure.

347
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,868
I figured an angle
to make money off your name.

348
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,639
My name? How's that?

349
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,513
Advertising. I know about that stuff.

350
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,118
What do you know about advertising?
Huh?

351
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,435
Hey, you can make money off my name,
make it, OK? I'm gonna take a shower.

352
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,669
- Hey, wanna help me off with these?
- Sure.

Rocky. What brings you here tonight?

367
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,040
Mr Jergens, the poster's wrong.

368
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,915
- What do you mean?
- I'm wearin' white pants with a red stripe.

369
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,479
It doesn't really matter, does it? I'm sure
you're gonna give us a great show.

370
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,636
Try to get some rest, kid. Good night.

371
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,470
I can't do it.

372
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,796
What?

373
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,876
I can't beat him.

374
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,836
Apollo?

375
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,235
Yeah.

376
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,318
I been out there, walking around, thinkin'.

377
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,959
I mean, who am I kiddin'?
I ain't even in the guy's league.

378
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,196
What are we gonna do?

379
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,996
I don't know.

380
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,915
You worked so hard.

381
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,396
Yeah, it don't matter,
cos I was nobody before.

382
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,550
Don't say that.

383
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,036
Come on, Adrian. It's true. I was nobody.

384
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,760
But that don't matter either, you know?

385
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,910
Cos I was thinkin'...

386
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,718
It really don't matter if I lose this fight.

387
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,319
It really don't matter if this guy
opens my head either.

388
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,318
Cos all I wanna do is go the distance.

389
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,035
Nobody's ever
gone the distance with Creed.

390
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,515
And if I can go that distance...

391
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,916
...and that bell rings and I'm still standin'...

392
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,229
...l'm gonna know for
the first time in my life, see...

393
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,759
...that I weren't just another
bum from the neighbourhood.

394
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,550
Time, kid. Let's go.

395
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,515
I'll wait for you here.

396
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,630
Well, how about I wait here and you fight,
you know?

397
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,116
You're lookin' very great today.
You know that? Mm?

398
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,638
I gotta go now,
but don't you leave town, huh?

399
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,872
Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.

400
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,877
Good luck.

401
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,356
Say, Adrian, you don't think
this robe is too baggy, you know?

402
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,392
- Good luck.
- Don't leave town.

403
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,990
I'd like you to meet the man
working the fight with me, Stu Nahan.

404
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,159
Thank you, Bill Baldwin. The electricity
is all over the place tonight...

405
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,754
What the hell is that? I trained you
to be a fighter, not a billboard.

406
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,633
- I'm doin' it for a friend.
- What do you get out of it?

407
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,309
- Paulie gets three grand, I get the robe.
- Shrewd.

408
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,159
On tonight's fight,
their difference in style...

409
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,034
...a recent magazine said it could be
the caveman against the cavalier.

410
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,597
The buzzing in the background could be
the challenger getting into the ring.

411
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,511
- Rocky! Look at me! Ya cost me $200.
- Oh. I gotta go. I gotta work.

412
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,835
- How's the robe?
- A little baggy.

413
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,838
<i>(Bill) A 50-1 underdog,
a Cinderella story...</i>

414
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,839
...and he's captured people's
imaginations all over the world.

415
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,995
We love you, Rocky!

416
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,714
- Yo, champ!
- Hey, thanks for showin' up.

417
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,197
<i>(Stu) His record: 44 victories -
38 by knockout. And he's lost 20 fights.</i>

418
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,754
<i>(Bill) Which makes me wonder,
can he stand it?</i>

419
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,192
The stamina and the skill to last
the three rounds? Las Vegas odds say no.

420
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,630
Rocky Balboa climbing into the ring now.

421
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,595
The Italian Stallion. Some meat sign
on the back of his robe there. See that?

422
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,870
"Shamrock Meat Company."

423
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,073
<i>(Stu) There's a lot of noise.
You could go deaf with that noise!</i>

424
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,395
Am I seeing right back there?

425
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,557
Is that the world heavyweight champion,
Apollo Creed?

426
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,639
<i>(Bill) He's riding in a boat. Is he
supposed to be George Washington?</i>

427
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,399
Obviously so.
He's got the hat on. Look at that.

428
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,274
<i>(Stu) Well, it's been confirmed.
The world champion Apollo Creed...</i>

429
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,551
<i>... is doing an imitation
of George Washington.</i>

430
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,312
He's throwing money.

431
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,479
Remember when we talked about
George Washington throwing a dollar?

432
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,196
Of course, throwing a dollar
in those days went a lot farther.

433
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,278
The white wig came off,
the hat came off...

434
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,668
I want all of you!

435
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,920
And the crowd is loving every minute of it.
Here is the world heavyweight champion.

436
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,352
<i>(Bill) For you around the world,
he was dressed as George Washington.</i>

437
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,438
I want all of you! Come on, Stallion!

438
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,439
<i>- (Stu) Uncle Sam himself...
- I want all of you!</i>

439
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,475
- All of you! I want all of you!
- He looks like a big flag.

440
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,989
I want you! You!

441
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,671
- Is he talkin' to me?
- He is.

442
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,916
- Is he talkin' to me?
- Let him talk.

443
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,429
I want the Stallion! Come on!

444
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,313
<i>(Bill) He says "I want the Stallion!"</i>

445
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,153
In foreign countries during World War I
there was a picture of Uncle Sam...

446
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,111
...with his finger pointed -

447
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,518
...a recruiting poster for our fellows
in the army and the navy. "I want you!"

448
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,596
<i>(Stu) That's what he's doing a take on.</i>

449
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,518
- That's it. "Creed" he's yelling.
- "Creed in three."

450
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,915
What do you think that outfit cost?

451
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,190
<i>(fanfare)</i>

452
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,310
<i>(bell)</i>

453
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,633
Ladies and gentlemen...

454
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,389
...good evening. A very happy new year.

455
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,476
Welcome to Philadelphia.

456
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,558
<i>(Stu) Everybody who's anybody
is here tonight.</i>

457
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,673
Time does not permit me to introduce
the many luminaries of politics...

458
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,952
...show business and the sporting world
who are with us tonight.

459
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,429
But I would like to present
one of the immortals of pugilism...

460
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,950
...a champion in and out of the ring.

461
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,640
Philadelphia's own Smokin' Joe...

462
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,752
...the beloved Mr Joe Frazier!

463
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,440
<i>(cheering, whistling and applause)</i>

464
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,109
Hi, how are you doing?
Don't hurt him, OK?

465
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,357
<i>(Stu) What a credit he's been
in his career as a fighter.</i>

466
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,596
He's coming over to talk with the champ.

467
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,632
- Hey, Joe!
- You been dumpin' me long time.

468
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,513
You next, Joe! You next, Joe!

469
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,909
They must be friends.

470
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,992
Joe Frazier!

471
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,591
Fight fans around the world, get settled
down, because it won't be long now.

472
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,039
<i>(bell)</i>

473
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,869
And now... for the main event!

474
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,914
On my left, the challenger.

475
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,118
In white trunks, weighing 190lb...

476
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,993
...Philadelphia's favourite son...

477
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,636
...the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa!

478
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,320
<i>(cheering and some booing)</i>

479
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,636
And on my right,
wearing red, white and blue...

480
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,797
...weighing 210lb...

481
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,192
...undefeated in 46 fights...

482
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,114
...the Master of Disaster...

483
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,676
...the undisputed
heavyweight champion of the world...

484
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,669
<i>...Apollo Creed!
- (cheering)</i>

485
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,189
I want you! I want you!

486
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,995
You, chump! I want you!

487
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,395
You've both fought in Philadelphia before.

488
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,274
You know the rules. No low blows.
Watch your heads. No buttin'.

489
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,349
- Shake hands now and come out fightin'.
- Put your hands up, chump. Come on!

490
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,758
<i>(Bill) A little body play goin' on there.
Rocky taking it carefully, though.</i>

491
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,509
He's just going over and being calm,
it looks like from here.

492
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,074
There goes the big hat.

493
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,473
<i>(Stu) I've never seen a fighter
that concerned about his hair!</i>

494
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,197
And there's the bell for round one.

495
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,518
The fighters come out into the centre
of the ring, looking at each other.

496
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,395
Creed the champion zipping those
left-handed jabs, right in the head.

497
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,671
The champ stinging
the slower challenger jabs at will.

498
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,634
In fact, it looks like Rocky is
blocking the blows with his face.

499
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,992
The champion doesn't look the best
he's ever been, but he's moving smoothly.

500
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,908
Well, the champion is smiling now.
He's toying with his man.

501
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,556
Tryin' to give the fans their money's
worth. He's makin' a show of it.

502
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,036
And a very badly outclassed
challenger right now.

503
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,270
<i>(Bill) Creed trying to
make this man make...</i>

504
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,198
See? Make him miss like that.

505
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,959
<i>(Stu) Oh, the champ
is just taunting him now.</i>

506
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,235
Creed dancing around.

507
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,549
I don't believe it! The champ is down!

508
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,636
<i>(Bill) Yes, he is!</i>

509
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,757
Creed is down! What a surprise this is!

510
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,158
<i>(Stu) This is the first time the champion
has ever been knocked down.</i>

511
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,869
Six! Seven! Eight!

512
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,037
He appears to be all right.
Glancin' around...

513
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,632
<i>(Mickey) Come on, Rock! Go to the ribs!
Let's go to work right now, Rock!</i>

514
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,272
<i>(Bill) Rocky comes back out. He's like
a bull in a china closet. He really wants it.</i>

515
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,914
Apollo, left to the head.

516
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,318
<i>(Stu) Now the champion's comin' back.
He's comin' off the floor now.</i>

517
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,678
<i>(Bill) Another left, another right.
Combinations into the face. That's Apollo!</i>

518
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,916
Now the champ is taunting Rocky
to come and get some more.

519
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,951
Left. Another.

520
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,116
Another left!

521
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,435
And Rocky's coming back now!

522
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,953
Left! Right! Rocky's got him on the rope!

523
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,870
OK, let's break it.

524
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,709
There's no way they expected
this kind of hitting power.

525
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,038
But the ability of the champion,
Apollo, is apparent.

526
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,392
<i>(Stu) Apollo unloading,
Rocky really tight against the ropes.</i>

527
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,476
<i>(bell)</i>

528
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,477
They're leading him back over to his
corner. Rocky can hardly find his way.

529
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,558
- I told ya! I told ya!
- Your nose is broke.

530
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,875
- How does it look?
- It's an improvement.

531
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,151
I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'.
Stick and move.

532
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,793
Go for the ribs.

533
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,435
- Don't let that bastard breathe.
- The guy's great.

534
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,030
He doesn't know it's a damn show.
He thinks it's a damn fight.

535
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,913
- Finish this bum and let's go home.
- Right.

536
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,630
Stay to the body! To his right!

537
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,116
<i>(Stu) Here we go. Round two.
Creed predicted he would win in three.</i>

538
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,710
Creed got knocked down in the first.
He came back at the end.

539
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,831
<i>(Bill) Oh, he's working now.</i>

540
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,349
Oh, that sharp left! Again, a hard right.

541
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,914
He's working Rocky into the corner again.

542
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,996
He's got Rocky back in the corner.

543
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,477
Pelting him left and right.
He's bouncing up against the ring.

544
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,873
<i>(Stu) Oh, Balboa's taking
a tremendous beating here.</i>

545
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,516
<i>- (Bill) Battering him like a punching bag.
- (Stu) What's keeping him up?</i>

546
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,834
<i>- He says he wants more!
- (Bill) He wants more!</i>

547
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,317
You folks in front of your television
are watching a battle, I tell you that!

548
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,675
<i>(Stu) Balboa trying to fight back...
Ooh, a tremendous hook!</i>

549
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,076
<i>(Bill) The champion is trying
to get himself out, but he can't.</i>

550
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,556
He is being barraged
with lefts and rights to his body!

551
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,150
<i>(Stu) Balboa is smacking the champion
right on the kisser!</i>

552
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,510
<i>- (bell)
- The referee's stepped in.</i>

553
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,870
They're ready to keep going!

554
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,116
Back to your corner!

555
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,515
Come on, Creed!

556
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,950
<i>(Stu) This is gonna be a tough one.</i>

557
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,796
<i>(Bill) Hard left and right combination!</i>

558
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,878
<i>(Stu) What is keeping him up, Bill?
I don't know!</i>

559
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,436
He can't even get his gloves up
to protect himself!

560
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,876
Down! Down! Stay down!

561
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,151
<i>(Bill) Apollo dancing around
with his arms in the air!</i>

562
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,875
Five!

563
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,355
Six! Seven!

564
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,110
Eight! Nine!

565
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,515
OK, OK. Come on!

566
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,154
<i>(Bill) Apollo can't believe it!</i>

567
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,436
<i>(bell)</i>

568
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,908
<i>(Stu) The champion got a left to the ribs,
his right ribs.</i>

569
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,353
- You OK, champ?
- Yeah, I'm OK, I'm OK.

570
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,956
I can't see nothin'.
I gotta open my eye. Cut me, Mick.

571
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,436
- You don't wanna do it.
- Go on, cut me. Cut me.

572
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:33,192
- You're bleeding inside. I'm gonna stop it.
- You ain't stoppin' nothin', man.

573
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,995
You stop this fight, I'll kill ya.

574
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,116
<i>(crowd chants) Rocky!</i>

575
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,512
<i>(Bill) The 15th and final round.</i>

576
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:56,958
<i>(crowd chants) Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

577
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,158
<i>(Stu) They look like they've
been in a war, these two.</i>

578
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,595
<i>(Bill) The champion really tightening!</i>

579
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,474
And Apollo clearly protecting
his right side, his ribs.

580
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,312
<i>(Stu) Hard left and right!
Look at the blood coming out!</i>

581
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,671
<i>(Bill) Oh, he's spitting out blood now.</i>

582
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,393
A tremendous right hand from Rocky!

583
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,317
Go for it, Rock!

584
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,193
<i>- (Bill) Listen to this crowd!
- (Stu) Left to the ribs.</i>

585
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,195
Right to the chin!
He's got him up against the rope!

586
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,319
<i>(bell)</i>

587
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,797
<i>(Apollo) There ain't gonna be no rematch!</i>

588
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,399
