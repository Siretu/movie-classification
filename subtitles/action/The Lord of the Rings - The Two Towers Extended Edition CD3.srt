1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,300
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,100
Cruel Men hurts us.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,300
Master tricksed us.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,100
Of course he did.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,200
I told you he was tricksy.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,400
I told you he was false.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,200
Master is our friend.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,800
Our friend.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,100
Master betrayed us.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,300
No. Not its business.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,800
Leave us alone!

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,400
Filthy little Hobbitses!

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,800
They stole it from us!

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,400
No. No.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,600
What did they steal?

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,100
My precious!

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,400
We have to get out of here.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You go. Go, now.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,400
You can do it.

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,300
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,300
Just this once.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,200
Put it on.

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,700
Disappear.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I can't.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,200
You were right, Sam.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,100
You tried to tell me but...

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,400
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,500
If I put it on...

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,000
...he'll find me.

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,600
He'll see.

32
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,900
Mr. Frodo...

33
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,000
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Here in the Wild I have you...

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,300
...two Halflings...

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,600
...and a host of men at my call.

37
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,400
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

38
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,900
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

39
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
...to show his quality.

40
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,200
No!

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,700
Stop it!

42
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
Leave him alone.

43
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,800
Don't you understand?

44
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,000
He's got to destroy it!

45
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,400
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

46
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,200
To the Mountain of Fire!

47
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,400
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

48
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,500
Please. It's such a burden.

49
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,800
Will you not help him?

50
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,100
Captain?

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,000
Prepare to leave.

52
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,400
The Ring will go to Gondor.

53
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,900
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

54
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,200
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

55
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,100
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

56
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,300
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,500
Bless you, laddie.

58
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,800
Gimli, where is the king?

59
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,900
You look terrible.

60
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
A great host, you say?

61
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,600
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

62
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,200
Ten thousand strong at least.

63
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,200
Ten thousand?

64
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,100
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

65
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,000
To destroy the world of Men.

66
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
They will be here by nightfall.

67
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,600
Let them come!

68
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,900
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

69
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,200
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

70
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,300
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

71
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,900
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

72
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,800
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

73
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,400
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,200
These are Uruk-hai.

75
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,800
Their armor is thick
and their shields broad.

76
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,100
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

77
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,900
I know how to defend my own keep.

78
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,900
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

79
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,300
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

80
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,200
Crops can be resown...

81
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,400
...homes rebuilt.

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,500
Within these walls...

83
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,400
...we will outlast them.

84
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,000
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

85
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,700
They come to destroy its people...

86
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,300
...down to the last child.

87
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,500
What would you have me do?

88
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,400
Look at my men.

89
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,300
Their courage hangs by a thread.

90
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,900
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

91
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,100
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

92
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,600
Send out riders, my lord.

93
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,800
You must call for aid.

94
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,400
And who will come?

95
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,400
Elves?

96
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Dwarves?

97
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,300
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

98
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,400
The old alliances are dead.

99
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,600
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

100
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

101
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,200
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

102
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Where was Gon...?

103
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,800
No, my Lord Aragorn...

104
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,900
...we are alone.

105
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,500
Get the women and children
into the caves.

106
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,000
We need more time
to lay provisions...

107
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,600
There is no time. War is upon us.

108
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,600
Secure the gate.

109
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,900
We Ents have not troubled...

110
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,500
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

111
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
...for a very long time.

112
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,300
But now, something
is about to happen...

113
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,800
...that has not happened...

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,500
...for an age.

115
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,900
Entmoot.

116
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,300
What's that?

117
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,600
'Tis a gathering.

118
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,400
A gathering of what?

119
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,700
Beech. Oak.

120
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,800
Chestnut. Ash.

121
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Good. Good. Good.

122
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,500
Many have come.

123
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,800
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,600
...will go to war.

125
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,600
Move back! Move to the caves!

126
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

127
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,900
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

128
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,300
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

129
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,600
Aragorn, you must rest.

130
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,100
You're no use to us half alive.

131
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,800
Aragorn!

132
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

133
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,100
That is an honorable charge.

134
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,100
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

135
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,000
What renown is there in that?

136
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,900
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

137
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,000
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

138
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,100
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

139
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,200
You do not command
the others to stay!

140
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,200
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

141
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,500
Because they love you.

142
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,300
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

144
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,200
These are no soldiers.

145
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,900
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

146
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,800
Look at them. They're frightened.

147
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
I can see it in their eyes.

148
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,600
Then I shall die as one of them!

149
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,900
Let him go, lad.

150
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,400
Let him be.

151
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,400
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armory.

152
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,500
My lord?

153
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,100
Who am I, Gamling?

154
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,400
You are our king, sire.

155
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,700
And do you trust your king?

156
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,400
Your men, my lord...

157
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,400
...will follow you to whatever end.

158
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,200
To whatever end.

159
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,600
Where is the horse and the rider?

160
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Where is the horn that was blowing?

161
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,700
<i>They have passed like rain
on the mountains.</i>

162
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,900
<i>Like wind in the meadow.</i>

163
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,400
The days have gone down in the West...

164
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,700
<i>...behind the hills...</i>

165
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,300
<i>...into Shadow.</i>

166
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,200
How did it come to this?

167
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,400
It's been going for hours.

168
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,900
They must have decided something
by now.

169
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,100
Decided? No.

170
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,400
We only just finished saying...

171
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,500
...good morning.

172
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,000
But it's nighttime already.

173
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,000
You can't take forever.

174
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,100
Don't be hasty.

175
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,000
We're running out of time!

176
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,900
Move! Move to the outer wall.

177
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,800
Give me your sword.

178
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,400
What is your name?

179
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,400
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

180
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,100
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.

181
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
They say that it is hopeless.

182
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,500
This is a good sword.

183
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,900
Haleth, son of Háma...

184
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,400
...there is always hope.

185
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,700
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

186
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,400
Forgive me.

187
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,100
I was wrong to despair.

188
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,100
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

189
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,600
It's a little tight across the chest.

190
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
That is no Orc horn.

191
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,300
Send for the king.

192
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,000
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

193
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,300
How is this possible?

194
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,000
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

195
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,400
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

196
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,300
Long ago we fought and died together.

197
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,500
We come to honor that allegiance.

198
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,900
You are most welcome.

199
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,200
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

200
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,200
You could have picked a better spot.

201
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,200
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

202
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,200
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

203
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,300
Let's hope they last the night.

204
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,600
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

205
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,600
Or would you like me to find you a box?

206
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,600
So it begins.

207
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,800
Did they hit anything?

208
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Give them a volley.

209
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,800
- Fire!
- Fire!

210
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,200
Send them to me! Come on!

211
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,000
Good!

212
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Swords! Swords!

213
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,000
Legolas! Two already!

214
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,300
I'm on 17!

215
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,100
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

216
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,600
Nineteen!

217
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,000
Merry.

218
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,200
We have just agreed.

219
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,700
Yes?

220
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,400
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

221
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,700
...and we have agreed...

222
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,200
...you are not Orcs.

223
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,100
Well, that's good news.

224
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,400
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

225
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,800
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

226
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,500
Hasty?

227
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,200
Our friends are out there.

228
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,500
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

229
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,100
War? Yes.

230
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,200
It affects us all.

231
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Tree, root and twig.

232
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,300
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

233
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,400
...it takes a long time...

234
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,500
...to say anything in Old Entish...

235
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,900
...and we never say anything...

236
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,000
...unless it is worth taking...

237
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,100
...a long time to say.

238
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,200
Seventeen! Eighteen!

239
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,500
Nineteen!

240
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,900
Twenty!

241
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,800
Twenty-one!

242
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Causeway!

243
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,000
Is this it?

244
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,100
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

245
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,500
Brace the gate!

246
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,100
Hold them! Stand firm!

247
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,300
Aragorn!

248
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,100
Gimli!

249
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,800
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

250
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,600
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

251
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,500
How can that be your decision?!

252
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,800
This is not our war.

253
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,300
But you're part of this world!

254
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,300
Aren't you?!

255
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,800
You must help. Please.

256
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,800
You must do something.

257
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,400
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

258
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,300
But your part in this tale is over.

259
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,700
Go back to your home.

260
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,000
Maybe Treebeard's right.

261
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,000
We don't belong here, Merry.

262
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,500
It's too big for us.

263
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,300
What can we do in the end?

264
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,300
We've got the Shire.

265
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,300
Maybe we should go home.

266
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,400
The fires of Isengard will spread...

267
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,500
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

268
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,200
And...

269
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,100
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

270
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,600
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

271
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,300
Aragorn!

272
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,800
Fall back to the Keep!

273
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,100
Get your men out of there!

274
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,400
Haldir!

275
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,800
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

276
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,200
Haldir!

277
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,500
Brace the gate!

278
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,000
Hold them!

279
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,100
To the gate. Draw your swords!

280
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,200
Make way!

281
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,900
We cannot hold much longer!

282
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,400
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

283
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,200
As long as you can give me.

284
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,000
Gimli!

285
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,900
Timbers!

286
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Brace the gate!

287
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,400
Come on. We can take them.

288
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,900
It's a long way.

289
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,900
Toss me.

290
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,900
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

291
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,600
You'll have to toss me!

292
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,500
Don't tell the Elf.

293
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,800
Not a word.

294
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,500
Shore up the door!

295
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,800
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

296
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Watch our backs!

297
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,400
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

298
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,700
Hold fast the gate!

299
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,900
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

300
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,200
Aragorn!

301
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,100
Pull everybody back.

302
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,300
Pull them back.

303
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,300
Fall back!

304
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,000
Fall back!

305
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,800
They have broken through!

306
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,300
The castle is breached. Retreat!

307
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,700
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

308
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,400
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

309
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,800
Into the Keep!

310
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:19,200
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

311
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,100
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

312
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,100
Wait! Stop!

313
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,500
Stop!

314
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,400
Turn around.

315
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,000
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

316
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,200
But that will lead you past Isengard.

317
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,200
Yes. Exactly.

318
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,600
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

319
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,500
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

320
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
It's the last thing he'll expect.

321
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,300
That doesn't make sense to me.

322
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,600
But then...

323
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,500
...you are very small.

324
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,700
Perhaps you're right.

325
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,900
South it is, then.

326
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,800
Hold on, little Shirelings.

327
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,600
I always like going south.

328
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,000
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

329
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,100
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

330
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,200
No, we won't.

331
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,200
Not this time.

332
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,900
Look!

333
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,000
Osgiliath burns!

334
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,600
Mordor has come.

335
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,100
The Ring will not save Gondor.

336
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,700
It has only the power to destroy.

337
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,900
Please...

338
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,700
...let me go.

339
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,400
Hurry.

340
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,200
Faramir!

341
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,900
You must let me go!

342
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,800
And those little family of field mice...

343
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,800
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

344
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,800
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

345
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Many of these trees were my friends.

346
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:42,300
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

347
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,700
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

348
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,600
They had voices of their own.

349
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,400
Saruman.

350
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,800
A wizard should know better!

351
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,700
There is no curse in Elvish...

352
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,600
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

353
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,100
...for this treachery.

354
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,300
Look! The trees! They're moving!

355
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,200
Where are they going?

356
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,000
They have business with the Orcs.

357
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,800
My business is with Isengard tonight...

358
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,600
...with rock and stone.

359
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,600
Yes.

360
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,100
Come, my friends.

361
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,700
The Ents are going to war.

362
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,600
It is likely...

363
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,300
...that we go to our doom.

364
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,200
Last march...

365
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,700
...of the Ents.

366
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,600
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

367
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
By nightfall we will be overrun.

368
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,100
Mr. Frodo?

369
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,500
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

370
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,100
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

371
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,900
Take them to my father.

372
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,400
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

373
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,900
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

374
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,700
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

375
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,100
You want to know
why your brother died?

376
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,300
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

377
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,400
He tried to kill him!

378
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,900
The Ring drove your brother mad!

379
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,600
Watch out!

380
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,600
Mr. Frodo?

381
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,100
They're here.

382
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,700
They've come.

383
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,200
Nazgûl!

384
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,400
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

385
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,400
Take cover!

386
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,300
The fortress is taken.

387
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,300
It is over.

388
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,400
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

389
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,500
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

390
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,700
They're breaking in!

391
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,800
They're past the door!

392
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,300
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

393
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,900
Is there no other way?

394
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,500
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

395
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,400
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

396
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,600
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

397
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,700
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

398
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,300
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

399
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,400
Ride out with me.

400
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,100
Ride out and meet them.

401
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,100
For death and glory.

402
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,600
For Rohan.

403
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,600
For your people.

404
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,300
The sun is rising.

405
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,800
<i>Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.</i>

406
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,300
<i>At dawn...</i>

407
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,200
<i>...look to the east.</i>

408
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,000
Yes.

409
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,100
Yes.

410
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,900
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

411
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,900
...shall sound in the Deep...

412
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,300
...one last time.

413
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,000
Yes!

414
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,800
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

415
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,900
Fell deeds, awake.

416
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,200
Now for wrath...

417
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,800
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

418
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,100
Forth Eorlingas!

419
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,100
Gandalf.

420
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,100
Théoden King stands alone.

421
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,900
Not alone.

422
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,400
Rohirrim!

423
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,500
Éomer.

424
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,200
To the king!

425
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,600
Yes!

426
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,200
A hit. A fine hit.

427
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,200
Break the dam!

428
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,800
Release the river!

429
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,900
Pippin! Hold on!

430
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,100
Hold on, little Hobbits.

431
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
What are you doing?

432
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,500
Where are you going?

433
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,000
It's me.

434
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,800
It's your Sam.

435
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,700
Don't you know your Sam?

436
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,800
I can't do this, Sam.

437
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,700
I know.

438
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,100
It's all wrong.

439
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,800
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

440
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,400
But we are.

441
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,800
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

442
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,400
The ones that really mattered.

443
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,400
Full of darkness and danger they were.

444
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,600
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

445
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,700
...because how could the end be happy?

446
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,400
<i>How could the world go back
to the way it was...</i>

447
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,100
<i>...when so much bad had happened?</i>

448
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,800
Victory!

449
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,500
We have victory!

450
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,600
<i>But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...</i>

451
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,100
<i>...this shadow.</i>

452
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,700
<i>Even darkness must pass.</i>

453
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,600
<i>A new day will come.</i>

454
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,700
<i>And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.</i>

455
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,000
<i>Those were the stories
that stayed with you...</i>

456
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,900
<i>...that meant something.</i>

457
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,700
<i>Even if you were too small
to understand why.</i>

458
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,900
<i>But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.</i>

459
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,700
<i>I know now.</i>

460
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,700
Folk in those stories...

461
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:41,000
...had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

462
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,400
They kept going...

463
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,300
...because they were holding
on to something.

464
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,300
What are we holding on to, Sam?

465
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,100
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

466
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,000
And it's worth fighting for.

467
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:41,200
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

468
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,900
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

469
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,300
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

470
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,100
Then it is forfeit.

471
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,500
Release them.

472
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,700
Stay out of the forest!

473
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,700
Keep away from the trees!

474
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,300
Final count...

475
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,300
...42.
- Forty-two?

476
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:16,600
That's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

477
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,100
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

478
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,500
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

479
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,700
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

480
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:36,600
...because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

481
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:43,500
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

482
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,300
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

483
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,500
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

484
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,500
I hear the staff are very good.

485
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,500
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

486
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:06,000
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

487
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,400
I'm starving.

488
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,600
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

489
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,900
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

490
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,300
Saruman's storeroom!

491
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,300
I don't believe it.

492
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,600
It can't be.

493
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,100
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

494
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,700
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

495
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,100
It's perfect. One barrel each.

496
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,400
Wait.

497
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,400
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

498
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,100
Share it?

499
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,300
No. No.

500
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,200
Dead plant and all that.

501
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,800
Don't think he'd understand.

502
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,200
Could be a distant relative.

503
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,500
I get it.

504
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,500
Don't be hasty.

505
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,400
Exactly.

506
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,800
Bar-hrum.

507
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,700
This is the old sewer.

508
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,900
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

509
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,800
You'll find cover in the woods there.

510
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,400
Captain Faramir...

511
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,900
...you have shown your quality, sir.

512
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,700
The very highest.

513
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,800
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

514
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,900
...where gardeners are held in high honor.

515
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,100
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

516
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,200
Gollum says there's a path...

517
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,400
...near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

518
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,600
Cirith Ungol?

519
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,700
- Is that its name?
- No.

520
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,500
No!

521
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,400
- Yes.
- Frodo...

522
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:44,300
...they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

523
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,700
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

524
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:54,300
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

525
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,600
I must.

526
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:04,700
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

527
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,900
Thank you.

528
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:22,900
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

529
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,900
Come on, keep up.

530
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,200
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

531
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,600
You know that, don't you?

532
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,000
He was trying to save you, see?

533
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,000
Save me?

534
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,500
So there's no hard feelings.

535
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:57,800
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

536
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,600
Gollum, Gollum.

537
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,400
Yes, master.

538
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,300
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

539
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,800
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

540
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:20,500
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

541
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,600
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

542
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,800
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

543
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,500
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

544
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,600
<i>...somewhere in the wilderness.</i>

545
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,400
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

546
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,900
What?

547
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,000
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

548
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:03,400
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

549
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,500
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

550
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,300
"Yes, my boy.

551
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,300
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

552
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,000
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

553
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,100
"Samwise the Brave."

554
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,000
I want to hear more about Sam.

555
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,300
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

556
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:32,700
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

557
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,200
So was I.

558
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,700
"Samwise the Brave."

559
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,400
Sméagol?

560
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,500
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

561
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,600
Master.

562
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,600
Master looks after us.

563
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,200
Master wouldn't hurt us.

564
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,800
Master broke his promise.

565
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,200
Don't ask Sméagol.

566
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,500
Poor, poor Sméagol.

567
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,500
Master betrayed us.

568
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:18,800
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

569
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,900
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

570
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,800
Kill him! Kill him!

571
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,500
Kill them both!

572
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:31,300
And then we take the precious...

573
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:35,000
...and we be the master!

574
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,300
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

575
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,200
Eyes always watching.

576
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:44,900
Then we stabs them out.

577
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:49,600
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

578
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,200
Yes. Yes. Yes.

579
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,100
Kill them both.

580
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,700
Yes. No! No!

581
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,600
It's too risky. It's too risky.

582
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,900
Where is he? Where has he gone?

583
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,700
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Sméagol?

584
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:14,200
We could let her do it.

585
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,300
Yes. She could do it.

586
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:24,100
Yes, precious, she could.

587
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:30,300
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

588
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:34,100
Once they're dead.

589
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:42,200
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

590
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,400
Sméagol will show you the way.

591
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,800
Follow me.
