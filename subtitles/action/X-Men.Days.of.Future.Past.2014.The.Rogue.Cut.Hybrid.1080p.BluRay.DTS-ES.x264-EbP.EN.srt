1
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,326
The future.

2
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,830
A dark, desolate world.

3
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:31,008
A world of war, suffering, loss...

4
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,260
on both sides.

5
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,807
Mutants and the humans
who dared to help them.

6
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:46,440
Fighting an enemy we cannot defeat.

7
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,220
Are we destined down this path?

8
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:21,767
Destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species before us?

9
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,149
Or can we evolve
fast enough to change ourselves?

10
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,151
Change our fate?

11
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,744
Is the future truly set?

12
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,251
They're here!

13
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,050
Time's up.

14
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,218
Sentinels!

15
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,473
Sunspot!

16
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,562
Let's go.

17
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,821
Run!

18
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,532
Go!

19
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,009
Blink! No!

20
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,600
Too late, assholes.

21
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,746
Don't move, you mutant scum!

22
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,626
No!

23
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,254
Flat on the ground,
hands behind your head!

24
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,762
So few of us left.

25
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,183
Professor?

26
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,727
I've found them.

27
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,154
Professor!

28
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,407
- Bobby.
- Hey, Storm.

29
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,576
Hey, kid.

30
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,121
Professor, you made it.

31
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,813
Whenever the Sentinels attack,
Warpath spots them...

32
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:51,193
then I send Bishop back to warn us
of the attack before it happens.

33
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,862
Blink scouts the next site...

34
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,949
and then we leave
before they ever know we were there.

35
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,743
Because... we never were.

36
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,745
What do you mean you were never there?

37
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,957
She projects Bishop back in time
a few days to warn the others...

38
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,750
of the coming attack.

39
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,044
So she sends Bishop back in time?

40
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,839
No, just his consciousness,
into his younger self.

41
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,257
His younger body.

42
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,217
Wow.

43
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,012
This might just work, Charles.

44
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,306
What might work?

45
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:27,104
The Sentinel Program was originally
conceived by Doctor Bolivar Trask.

46
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:31,900
In the early '70s, he was one of the world's
leading weapons designers.

47
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,363
But, covertly, he had begun
experimenting on mutants...

48
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,700
using their gifts
to fuel his own research.

49
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,243
This is extraordinary.

50
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,621
There was one mutant who had discovered
what he was doing.

51
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:49,626
A mutant with the ability
to transform herself into anyone.

52
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,545
Mystique.

53
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,506
I knew her as Raven.

54
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:58,051
We met when we were children,
grew up together.

55
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,721
She was like a sister to me.

56
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,764
I tried to help her...

57
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,476
but only succeeded in driving her away.

58
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:10,063
She hunted Trask across the world.

59
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:15,027
And at the Paris Peace Accords in 1973,
after the Vietnam War...

60
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,237
she found Trask...

61
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,867
and killed him.

62
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,750
It was the first time she killed.

63
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,460
It wasn't her last.

64
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:35,380
But killing Trask did not have
the outcome she expected.

65
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:39,551
It only persuaded the government
of the need for his program.

66
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,929
They captured her that day...

67
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,890
tortured her,
experimented on her.

68
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:50,437
In her DNA, they discovered the secrets
to her powers of transformation.

69
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,648
It gave them the key they needed...

70
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:56,777
to create weapons that could adapt
to any mutant power.

71
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,196
And in less than 50 years...

72
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,532
the machines that have destroyed...

73
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,618
so many of our kind were created.

74
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:09,248
But it all started that day in 1973...

75
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,124
the day she first killed.

76
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,335
The day she truly became...

77
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,878
Mystique.

78
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,298
You want to go back there.

79
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,760
If I can get to her,
stop the assassination...

80
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,303
keep her out of their hands...

81
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,890
then we can stop the Sentinels
from ever being born.

82
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,227
And end this war before it ever begins.

83
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:37,317
I can send someone back
a couple weeks.

84
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,236
Maybe a month.

85
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,573
But you're talking about
going back decades.

86
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,576
You have the most powerful brain
in the world, Professor...

87
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:49,913
but the mind can only stretch so far
before it snaps.

88
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,542
It would rip you apart. I'm sorry.

89
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,878
No one could survive that trip.

90
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,256
What if someone's mind
has a way of snapping back?

91
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,427
What if someone can heal
as fast as they're ripped apart?

92
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,595
It's a risk.

93
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:05,929
Yeah, I'm getting that.

94
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,723
Not just for you.

95
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,184
You do this, you change history.

96
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,435
That's kind of the point.

97
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,770
Some of us could be killed.

98
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:18,483
Some of us may never be born.
We have no idea how things may change.

99
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,527
We could keep going.

100
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,237
Keep fighting.

101
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,614
Until what?

102
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,659
You've got a decision to make.

103
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:31,914
You can keep sending Bishop back in time
over and over again to warn you,

104
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:36,043
until one day, he doesn't make it,
and you all die.

105
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,045
Or you can give up this life.

106
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,797
So that they
and everyone else who died in this war

107
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,883
can actually have a future.

108
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:47,596
You're asking us to sacrifice our lives
for a future we might not even be a part of.

109
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:48,972
Yes.

110
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,016
A second chance.

111
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,436
A better chance for everyone.

112
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,318
My people need to vote.

113
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,573
They just did.

114
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,034
They're in.

115
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,679
Okay, spread out.

116
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,014
Take your positions.

117
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,573
So I wake up in my younger body,
God knows where.

118
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,866
Then what?

119
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,035
You'll need to go to my house
and find me.

120
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,788
Convince me of all of this.

121
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,582
Won't you be able to just read my mind?

122
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,877
I didn't have my powers in 1973.

123
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,381
Logan, you're going to have to do for me
what I once did for you.

124
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,342
Lead me, guide me.

125
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,970
I was a very different man then.

126
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,264
You'll have to be patient with me.

127
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,559
Patience is my strongest suit.

128
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,895
- You'll need me as well.
- What?

129
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,814
After Mystique left Charles,
she came with me...

130
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:24,026
and I set her on a dangerous path.

131
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,652
A darker path.

132
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,405
It's going to take the two of us,
side by side...

133
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,200
at a time when we couldn't
be further apart.

134
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,913
Great.

135
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,415
So where do I find you?

136
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,250
Well, it's complicated.

137
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,795
Are you sure about this?

138
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:49,218
It's not just his power that'll be tested.
I've seen what this can do to you.

139
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:51,762
I can handle this.

140
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,764
Trust me.

141
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,644
I guess I'll see you in the next life.

142
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:17,621
Basically, your body will go to sleep
while your mind travels back in time.

143
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:22,000
As long as you're back there,
past and present will continue to coexist.

144
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,794
But once you wake up...

145
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,840
whatever you've done
will take hold and become history.

146
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:31,051
And for the rest of us,
it will be the only history that we know.

147
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:34,513
It will be like the last 50 years
never happened.

148
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,182
And this world, and this war...

149
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,727
the only person who will
remember it is you.

150
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,605
All right, Logan...

151
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:46,900
I need you to clear your head
and to stay as calm as possible.

152
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,485
What? What do you mean?

153
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,946
If your mind gets rocky,
it will be harder for me to hold you...

154
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,407
and you could start
to slip between past and future.

155
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,492
What if I need to get a little rocky?

156
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,911
Think peaceful thoughts?

157
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,914
Peaceful thoughts...
Do you have any good news?

158
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,918
Well, you don't really age,
so you'll pretty much look the same.

159
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,921
You won't have much time in the past.

160
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,631
The Sentinels will find us.

161
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,049
They always do.

162
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,843
And this time, we won't be able to run.

163
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,553
We'll have no escape.

164
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,890
This is our last chance.

165
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:22,186
- You really think this will work?
- I have faith in him.

166
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,229
It's not him I'm worried about, it's us.

167
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,856
We were young...

168
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,524
we didn't know any better.

169
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,028
We will now.

170
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,405
See you all soon.

171
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,575
This might sting a little.

172
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,088
Holy shit.

173
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,764
It worked.

174
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,562
What's going on?

175
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,772
- Gwen, get dressed.
- Who the hell are you?

176
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:31,982
I don't know what's going on.

177
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,693
You're supposed to be guarding
the boss's daughter, not screwing her.

178
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,695
Well, I didn't sleep with her.

179
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,488
- No?
- No.

180
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,909
I mean, yes, I slept with her many times.

181
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,243
Jimmy!

182
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,829
That wasn't me.
That was the old me.

183
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:48,582
I just got here 20 seconds ago.

184
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,751
Really? Then what happened to your clothes?

185
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,377
My...

186
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,006
Would you believe me if I told you
I was sent here from the future?

187
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,302
- Get out of here, sweetheart.
- Yeah.

188
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,221
- We're gonna take care of this comedian.
- No, you're not.

189
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,556
You're gonna give me the keys
to your car and some money for gas...

190
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,849
or you're gonna wake up in the hospital.

191
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,726
Trust me,
I know how these things play out.

192
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,436
Because you're from the future?

193
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,562
No.

194
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,356
Because of these.

195
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,151
What the hell?

196
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,783
God damn it!

197
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,684
Peaceful thoughts.

198
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:09,037
Jimmy! What happened to Ramon?

199
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,290
And why are you talking crazy talk?

200
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,749
- Look...
- Gwen.

201
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:17,087
Gwen, you're gonna wanna lay low
for a few days, all right? Starting now.

202
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,172
Come on, out.

203
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,257
Go.

204
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:36,106
Today, the 18th MP Brigade
is departing from Saigon,

205
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,151
marking the last American troops
to leave Vietnam.

206
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,904
and effectively ending the war.

207
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,034
We are reviewing
all of our defense expenditures...

208
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,244
and all the black books
are being opened.

209
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:53,207
We can't support a weapon
that targets our own citizens.

210
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:54,917
If these mutants, as you describe...

211
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:57,419
are already living among us...

212
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,421
then they are living here peacefully.

213
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,173
We haven't had an incident
in over 10 years.

214
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,591
After what happened in Cuba?

215
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,051
That was never confirmed.

216
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,428
We have very real enemies out there...

217
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:07,930
the Russians, the Chinese.

218
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:11,099
We are talking about a tenth
of a tenth...

219
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,310
of a tenth of our population.

220
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,812
Allow me to read something to you.

221
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,022
Please.

222
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:19,983
This was acquired by our friends
at the CIA.

223
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,401
It's a dissertation...

224
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:25,239
written by a mutant at Oxford University.

225
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,407
And I quote...

226
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,743
"To Homo Neanderthalensis...

227
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,120
his mutant cousin, Homo Sapiens..."

228
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,914
which is us...

229
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,083
"was an aberration.

230
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,378
The arrival of the mutated human species,
Homo Sapiens...

231
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:43,882
was followed by the immediate extinction
of their less evolved kin."

232
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:50,514
Now, we are the Neanderthal.

233
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,474
Speak for yourself, Dr. Trask.

234
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,312
You know,
when you sent our soldiers to Vietnam...

235
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,106
without the weapons they needed
to win the war...

236
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,191
you underestimated your enemy.

237
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,862
You do that with this enemy...

238
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:08,991
and it won't be some border skirmish
halfway around the world.

239
00:24:09,158 --> 00:24:11,326
This time, the war will
be for our streets...

240
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,704
our cities, our homes...

241
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:17,916
and by the time
you see the need for my program...

242
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,377
it will be too late...

243
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:25,174
and you will have lost
two wars in one lifetime.

244
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,220
We are sorry, Dr. Trask...

245
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,973
but your Sentinel Program...

246
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,601
it ain't gonna fly.

247
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:49,364
Can I help you, Colonel?

248
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,742
Just here to give our boys
a proper send-off.

249
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:55,204
I'm sorry, sir, but we have orders.
This is a quarantined area.

250
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,372
Stand aside, soldier.

251
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,416
That's an order.

252
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,551
Atten-hut!

253
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:11,637
At ease.

254
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:36,328
What is all this?

255
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:37,996
Lab reports, blood tests.

256
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,832
It's all getting packed up
and shipped back.

257
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,041
Where is it going?

258
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:42,167
Same place they are.

259
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,253
Trask Industries.

260
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,381
Let's go, gentlemen.

261
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,758
I'm taking you out of this shit show.

262
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,760
Shipping home?

263
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:53,971
Not just yet.

264
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,181
What are you doing with those?

265
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:58,058
Something to make the ride
a little smoother.

266
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,644
I'm transferring you
to a private facility...

267
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,146
where we can run a few more tests.

268
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,195
Your men are not military.

269
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,531
Private outfit.

270
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,491
We're authorized to remand these men.

271
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:20,873
These troops are going home.

272
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,043
Well, Colonel, I don't believe
you have jurisdiction in this matter.

273
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,297
I'm afraid I do, son.

274
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,590
I'm sorry, who are you?

275
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,884
The question is, Major...

276
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:37,139
...who are you?

277
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,644
Raven!

278
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,437
That's not my name.

279
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,028
I had that.

280
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:34,279
I know.

281
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,075
Let's move out. Come on, let's go.

282
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:39,409
Where's Erik?

283
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:40,661
I'm on my own now.

284
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,582
Let's go! Move it!

285
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,727
Hold that plane!

286
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:09,064
Wouldn't wanna leave these boys
in this godforsaken country.

287
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:10,232
Yes, sir.

288
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,776
You're not coming with us, are you?

289
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:14,611
My war's not over.

290
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,321
The enemy is still out there.

291
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:41,513
The four privates, where did they go?

292
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,515
They were headed towards the tarmac.

293
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,659
Can I help you?

294
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,537
Yeah, what happened to the school?

295
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:49,665
The school's been shut for years.
Are you a parent?

296
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,459
I sure as hell hope not.
Who are you?

297
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:54,670
I'm Hank. Hank McCoy.

298
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,839
I look after the house now.

299
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:58,882
You're Beast?

300
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,385
Look at you.
I guess you're a late bloomer.

301
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,304
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

302
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:06,139
So where's the Professor?

303
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:07,474
There's no professor here.

304
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:09,685
You're pretty strong for a scrawny kid.

305
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:12,145
You sure there's not
a little Beast in there?

306
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:13,939
- No, he's not here.
- Come on, Beast.

307
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,482
- Come on, Beastie.
- No.

308
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:20,112
I said the school's closed.

309
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:22,197
- You need to leave.
- Not until I see the Professor.

310
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,825
There's no professor here,
I told you that.

311
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,495
Look, kid.
You and I are gonna be good friends.

312
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,708
You just don't know it yet.

313
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:36,753
Professor!

314
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:44,094
Professor!

315
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:00,777
Hank?

316
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:02,738
What's going on here?

317
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,240
Professor?

318
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:06,617
Please don't call me that.

319
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:08,243
Why? You know this guy?

320
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,704
Yeah, he looks slightly familiar.

321
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,998
Get off the bloody chandelier, Hank.

322
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,210
You can walk.

323
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:17,586
You're a perceptive one.

324
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:19,254
I thought Erik...

325
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:22,508
Which makes it slightly perplexing that
you missed our sign on the way in.

326
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:23,842
This is private property, my friend.

327
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:26,053
I'm gonna have to ask him
to ask you to leave.

328
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,598
I'm afraid I can't do that...

329
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,644
because I was sent here for you.

330
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:36,813
Tell whoever it was that sent you
that I'm busy.

331
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:39,024
That's gonna be a little tricky...

332
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:42,819
because the person who sent me was you.

333
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:43,987
What?

334
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,656
About 50 years from now.

335
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,411
I know. Stay with me.

336
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:53,997
- Like in the future, 50 years from now?
- Yeah.

337
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,999
- I sent you from the future?
- Yeah.

338
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:57,709
Piss off.

339
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,505
If you had your powers,
you'd know I was telling the truth.

340
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,216
How do you know I don't have my p...

341
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:06,051
- Who are you?
- I told you.

342
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:07,594
- Are you CIA?
- No.

343
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:08,679
You've been watching me?

344
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:10,472
I know you, Charles.

345
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:12,558
We've been friends for years.

346
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,685
I know your powers
came when you were 9.

347
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,563
I know you thought you were going crazy
when it started...

348
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,773
all the voices in your head.

349
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,400
And it wasn't until you were 12...

350
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:24,987
that you realized all the voices
were in everyone else's head.

351
00:32:25,154 --> 00:32:27,364
Do you want me to go on?

352
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,033
I never told anyone that.

353
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:33,745
Not yet, no, but, you will.

354
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:38,083
All right, you've piqued my interest.
What do you want?

355
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,335
We have to stop Raven.

356
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:44,590
I need your help.

357
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:47,509
We need your help.

358
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:53,807
I think I'd like to wake up now.

359
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:00,981
What does she have to do with this?

360
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:06,862
So you're saying...

361
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:09,156
they took Raven's power, and what?

362
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,700
They weaponized it?

363
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:12,868
Yep.

364
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:15,078
She is unique.

365
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,164
Yeah, she is, Hank.

366
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:20,250
In the beginning, the Sentinels
were just targeting mutants.

367
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:23,212
Then they began to identify the genetics
in non-mutants...

368
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,966
who would eventually have mutant children
and grandchildren.

369
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:31,512
Many of the humans tried to help us,
but it was a slaughter.

370
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:34,681
leaving only the worst of
humanity in charge.

371
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,808
I've been in a lot of wars.

372
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:40,812
I'd never seen anything like this.

373
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:43,106
And it all starts with her.

374
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,651
Let's just say for the sake of...

375
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:49,404
the sake, that I choose to believe you...

376
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:52,616
that I choose to help you.
Raven won't listen to me.

377
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:58,705
Her heart and soul
belong to someone else now.

378
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:00,207
I know.

379
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:04,711
That's why we're gonna need Magneto, too.

380
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,630
Erik?

381
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,049
- You do know where he is?
- Yeah.

382
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:15,430
Could you give me that
one more time, please?

383
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:16,598
You heard me.

384
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:23,146
He's where he belongs.

385
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:25,691
You're just gonna walk out?

386
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:28,402
Top marks.
Like I said, you are perceptive.

387
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,320
The Professor I know
would never turn his back...

388
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:32,406
on someone who'd lost their path.

389
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:34,575
Especially someone he loved.

390
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:38,328
You know...

391
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:40,664
I think I do remember you now.

392
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:44,877
Yeah. Tall, angry fellow
with the contentious hair.

393
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,880
We came to you a long time ago...
seeking your help.

394
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:52,176
And I'm gonna say to you
what you said to us then.

395
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:55,137
Fuck off.

396
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:56,889
Listen to me, you little shit.

397
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:00,475
I've come a long way,
and I've watched a lot of people die.

398
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:02,311
Good people. Friends.

399
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:03,854
If you're gonna wallow in self-pity...

400
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,814
and do nothing, then you're
gonna watch the same thing...

401
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:07,566
you understand?

402
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,323
We all have to die sometime.

403
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,038
Told you there was no professor here.

404
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,125
What the hell happened to him?

405
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:31,048
He lost everything.

406
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:33,634
Erik, Raven...

407
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,594
his legs.

408
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:38,639
We built the school, the labs,
this whole place...

409
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:42,559
then, just after the first semester...

410
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:44,311
the war in Vietnam got worse.

411
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:46,897
Many of the teachers...

412
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,900
and older students were drafted.

413
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:51,610
It broke him.

414
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:54,404
He retreated into himself.

415
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,824
I wanted to help, do something...

416
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,034
so I designed a serum to treat his spine...

417
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:03,247
derived from the same formula
that helps me control my mutation.

418
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:07,209
I take just enough
to keep myself balanced...

419
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:10,337
but he takes too much.

420
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,756
I tried easing him back...

421
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:16,426
but he just couldn't bear the pain,
the voices.

422
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:19,054
The treatment gives him his legs...

423
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:21,723
but it's not enough.

424
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:27,229
He's just lost too much.

425
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,077
You're not scared of me?

426
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:46,165
I always believed
I couldn't be the only one in the world.

427
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,208
Charles Xavier.

428
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,087
Raven.

429
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,174
You're hungry and alone.

430
00:36:55,549 --> 00:37:00,012
Take whatever you want. We've got
lots of food. You don't have to steal.

431
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:02,222
In fact...

432
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,892
you never have to steal again.

433
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:07,227
And that's a promise.

434
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,818
I'll help you get her.

435
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:19,698
Not for any of your future shite,
but for her.

436
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:21,033
Fair enough.

437
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:24,328
But I'll tell you this.
You don't know Erik.

438
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:27,122
That man is a monster. A murderer.

439
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:31,210
You think you can convince Raven
to change? To come home?

440
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,045
That's splendid.

441
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:36,465
But what makes you think
you can change him?

442
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:40,219
Because you and Erik sent
me back here together.

443
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:45,933
The room they're holding him in
was built during the Second World War...

444
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,643
when there was a shortage of steel.

445
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:51,563
So the foundation is pure concrete
and sand. No metal.

446
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,814
He's being held...

447
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:57,569
a hundred floors beneath the most
heavily guarded building on the planet.

448
00:37:57,736 --> 00:37:59,112
Why is he in there?

449
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:02,074
What, he forgot to mention?

450
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:05,285
JFK.

451
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:06,787
He killed...

452
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,750
What else explains a bullet
miraculously curving through the air?

453
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,544
Erik's always had a way with guns.

454
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:15,337
Are you sure you want to carry on with this?

455
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,797
This is your plan, not mine.

456
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,966
We don't have any resources
to get us in.

457
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,717
Or out.

458
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:23,053
It's just me and Hank.

459
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,555
I knew a guy.

460
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:26,181
Yeah, he'd be a young man now.

461
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:28,642
Grew up outside of D.C.

462
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,311
He could get into anywhere.

463
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:34,022
I just don't know
how the hell we're gonna find him.

464
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:38,026
Is Cerebro out of the question?

465
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:39,903
If only you guys had Internet.

466
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:44,408
What's "Internet?"

467
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:49,496
We have a phonebook.

468
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:58,172
I thought you'd be getting ready
for your trip, sir.

469
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:00,257
I just came to grab a couple files.

470
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:03,802
Is that a new scarf? It's nice.

471
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:05,095
Thank you.

472
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:37,437
Dr. Trask?

473
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:38,522
One second.

474
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,610
We added some names
to the Paris meeting.

475
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:48,365
Thank you.

476
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:50,868
Is something wrong, sir?

477
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:53,954
No. It's nothing.

478
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:56,874
Would you mind typing up my itinerary?

479
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,042
I don't wanna miss anything.

480
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:08,844
- Here, here, here.
- Where?

481
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:10,387
- Just stop here.
- All right, all right.

482
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:12,639
Next time I'm driving.
Don't get used to it.

483
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:32,117
What's he done now?

484
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:33,911
I will just write you a check
for whatever he took.

485
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,370
We just need to talk to him.

486
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:42,252
Peter! The cops are here. Again.

487
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:50,427
I'm a princess. What are you?

488
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,806
I'm the Wolverine.

489
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:56,725
Where's your brother?

490
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:02,439
Go upstairs and bug your sister.

491
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:04,107
But she bugs me!

492
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:14,701
What do you guys want?

493
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:17,538
I didn't do anything.
I've been here all day.

494
00:42:18,664 --> 00:42:20,624
Just relax, Peter. We're not cops.

495
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:23,001
Of course you're not. If you were,
you wouldn't be driving a rental car.

496
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:24,169
How did you know we've got a rental car?

497
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:26,171
I checked your registration
when you were walking to the door.

498
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:28,340
I also had some time to kill
so I went through your rental agreement.

499
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,592
Saw you were from out of town.
Are you FBI?

500
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:33,679
No, you're not cops.
What's with this gifted youngsters place?

501
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:36,181
That's an old card.

502
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:39,434
- He's fascinating.
- He's a pain in the arse.

503
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:40,769
What, a teleporter?

504
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:42,020
No, he's just fast.

505
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:44,565
And when I knew him he wasn't so... young.

506
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,234
Young? You're just old.

507
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:50,112
So you're not afraid to show your powers?

508
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,613
What powers?
What are you talking about?

509
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:54,074
Do you see something strange here?

510
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:57,369
Nothing anybody would believe
if you told them.

511
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:03,041
So, who are you?
What do you want?

512
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,793
- We need your help, Peter.
- For what?

513
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,004
To break into a highly secured facility...

514
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:08,714
and to get someone out.

515
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:09,923
Prison break?

516
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:11,758
That's illegal, you know.

517
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:17,973
Only if you get caught.

518
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,183
So, what's in it for me?

519
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:22,644
You, you kleptomaniac,
get to break into the Pentagon.

520
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,235
How do I know I can trust you?

521
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:32,738
Because we're just like you.

522
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:36,241
Show him.

523
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:50,088
That's cool, but it's disgusting.

524
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:56,720
Built in 1943, the Pentagon
is the world's largest office building...

525
00:43:56,887 --> 00:43:59,765
housing more than
25,000 military employees...

526
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:01,517
stretched over six million square feet.

527
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,601
Where's the bathroom?

528
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,811
He always needs to pee!

529
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:06,980
Lucky for you, you'll have...

530
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,752
We're getting broadcast signal down here.
What's going on?

531
00:45:10,836 --> 00:45:12,671
Damn it, call Maintenance,
get them down here.

532
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:53,397
...fought for and captured the island of Iwo Jima
from the Japanese Empire.

533
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:55,440
Now, this month-long battle...

534
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:58,819
included some of the fiercest fighting
during World War II in the Pacific...

535
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,962
In three seconds,
those doors are going to open...

536
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:19,464
and 20 guards will be here to shoot us.

537
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,301
I know. That's what I'm waiting for.

538
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:23,468
What are you doing?

539
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:25,220
I'm holding your neck so you don't get whiplash.

540
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:26,305
What?

541
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,640
Whiplash.

542
00:47:33,145 --> 00:47:34,479
Don't move!

543
00:47:49,495 --> 00:47:51,997
You're good, it'll pass.
It happens with everyone.

544
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,668
You must have done
something pretty serious.

545
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:58,212
What did you do, man?

546
00:47:58,295 --> 00:47:59,796
What did you do?

547
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,590
What did you do?
Why'd they have you in there?

548
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:03,467
For killing the President.

549
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:07,429
Wow. Shit.

550
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:11,558
The only thing I'm guilty of
is fighting for people like us.

551
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:13,602
You take karate? You know karate, man?

552
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:15,812
I don't know karate.

553
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:17,356
But I know crazy.

554
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:21,235
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
this is a Code Red situation.

555
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:23,320
We are evacuating the entire floor...

556
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:26,114
so that my associate and I...

557
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:27,825
can secure the prison.

558
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:31,078
- Who are you?
- We're special operations, CB...

559
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:32,496
FB-CID.

560
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:35,415
Perhaps you didn't hear me
when first I spoke...

561
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:37,334
but it is imperative
that you understand...

562
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:40,712
we're in a complete lockdown situation.
We have to get you to the third floor...

563
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:49,805
I'm sorry. Were you finished?

564
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:56,895
They told me you control metal.

565
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:58,480
"They"?

566
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:04,653
You know, my mom once knew a guy
who could do that.

567
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:10,159
I'm sorry, I'm just not
very good with violence.

568
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:14,538
Charles?

569
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:23,172
Good to see you too, old friend.

570
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:24,464
And walking.

571
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,049
No thanks to you.

572
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:29,970
You're the last person in the world
I expected to see today.

573
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:31,430
Believe me...

574
00:49:31,597 --> 00:49:33,265
I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to.

575
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,601
If we get you out of here,
we do it my way.

576
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:36,768
No killing.

577
00:49:37,186 --> 00:49:38,187
No helmet.

578
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:40,772
I couldn't disobey you even if I wanted.

579
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:43,484
I'm never getting inside of that head again.

580
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:46,778
I need your word, Erik.

581
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,116
Nobody move!

582
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:53,619
Hold it right there!

583
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:57,331
- Charles.
- Don't move.

584
00:49:57,498 --> 00:49:59,500
Hands up, or we will shoot!

585
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:01,293
- Freeze them, Charles.
- I can't.

586
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:02,669
Hands up!

587
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:08,425
No!

588
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:03,248
Thanks, kid.

589
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,963
Peter, thank you very, very much.

590
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,131
You take care.

591
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:13,634
I saw your flight plan in the cockpit.
Why are you going to Paris?

592
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,022
Imagine if they were metal.

593
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,192
- Do me a favor and return it for me.
- Okay.

594
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:31,610
And, Peter?

595
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,362
Take it slow.

596
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:36,365
Where did they dig you up?

597
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:39,952
You're gonna find
this hard to believe...

598
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:42,955
but you sent me.

599
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:45,290
You and Charles.

600
00:52:45,457 --> 00:52:47,042
From the future.

601
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:11,650
How did you lose them?

602
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:14,069
The treatment for my spine affects my DNA.

603
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:19,408
You sacrificed your powers
so you could walk?

604
00:53:20,242 --> 00:53:23,412
I sacrificed my powers so that I could sleep.

605
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:26,999
What do you know about it?

606
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:28,417
I've lost my fair share.

607
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:31,670
Dry your eyes, Erik.

608
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:33,505
It doesn't justify what you've done.

609
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:35,340
You have no idea what I've done.

610
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:37,176
I know that you took the things
that mean the most to me.

611
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:39,761
Maybe you should have
fought harder for them.

612
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:41,138
If you want a fight, Erik...

613
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:42,764
- Sit down.
- ...I will give you a fight!

614
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:43,974
Let him come.

615
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:45,809
You abandoned me!

616
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:47,102
You took her away...

617
00:53:47,186 --> 00:53:48,270
and you abandoned me!

618
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:49,855
Angel.

619
00:53:50,189 --> 00:53:51,523
Azazel.

620
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:54,026
Emma.

621
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:55,569
Banshee.

622
00:53:56,528 --> 00:53:58,197
Mutant brothers and sisters...

623
00:53:58,363 --> 00:53:59,823
all dead!

624
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:03,785
Countless others...

625
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:04,912
experimented on.

626
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:06,038
Butchered!

627
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:07,122
Erik!

628
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:08,332
Where were you, Charles?

629
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:11,001
We were supposed to protect them!

630
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:13,879
Where were you
when your own people needed you?

631
00:54:14,046 --> 00:54:16,131
Hiding! You and Hank!

632
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:18,300
Pretending to be something you're not!

633
00:54:18,884 --> 00:54:20,260
Erik!

634
00:54:22,095 --> 00:54:24,640
You abandoned us all.

635
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:46,995
So, you were always an asshole.

636
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:52,125
I take it we're best buddies in the future.

637
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:56,922
I spent a lot of years
trying to bring you down, bub.

638
00:54:57,506 --> 00:54:59,258
How does that work out for you?

639
00:54:59,424 --> 00:55:01,134
You're like me.

640
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,054
You're a survivor.

641
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:09,434
Do you wanna pick all that shit up?

642
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:32,833
General, maybe you should slow down,
we have a big day tomorrow.

643
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:39,506
We're celebrating, captain. It's not every day you win
a war, let alone against the American devils.

644
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:43,343
I'm getting another bottle.

645
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:01,487
Excuse me.

646
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:04,615
I'm pretty sure it was my fault.

647
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:06,408
You speak Vietnamese.

648
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:07,743
I'm an interpreter.

649
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:12,247
I speak many tongues.

650
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:15,167
Let me buy you another drink...

651
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:17,586
unless you're here with someone.

652
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:20,631
I'm alone.

653
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:24,176
A bottle of Johnnie Walker please.

654
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:41,610
You're going to the Summit tomorrow?

655
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:51,703
A pretty girl interested in politics...

656
00:56:51,787 --> 00:56:54,373
Looks can be deceiving.

657
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:56,250
Lady.

658
00:56:57,042 --> 00:57:00,254
Show me more, baby?

659
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:04,633
Clothes off?

660
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:21,150
What's the matter, baby?
You don't think I look pretty like this?

661
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:10,449
Fancy a game? It's been a while.

662
00:58:10,616 --> 00:58:12,284
I'm not in the mood for games, thank you.

663
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:22,085
I haven't had a real sip in ten years.

664
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,225
I didn't kill the President.

665
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:39,311
The bullet curved, Erik.

666
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:40,979
Because I was trying to save him.

667
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:44,066
They took me out before I could.

668
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:45,275
Why would you try and save him?

669
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,986
Because he was one of us.

670
00:58:59,164 --> 00:59:01,583
You must think me so foolish.

671
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:05,170
We've always said they
would come after us.

672
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:08,674
I never imagined they'd use
Raven's DNA to do it.

673
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,843
When did you last see her?

674
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:16,390
The day I left for Dallas.

675
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:18,684
And how was she?

676
00:59:20,686 --> 00:59:21,687
Strong.

677
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:23,564
Driven.

678
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:25,774
Loyal.

679
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:28,610
How was she?

680
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:31,530
She was...

681
00:59:33,282 --> 00:59:35,033
We were...

682
00:59:38,537 --> 00:59:40,873
I could see why she meant so much to you.

683
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:45,127
You should be proud of her, Charles.

684
00:59:46,712 --> 00:59:48,589
She's out there fighting for our cause.

685
00:59:48,755 --> 00:59:50,132
Your cause.

686
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:53,719
The girl I raised was not capable of killing.

687
00:59:53,886 --> 00:59:55,387
You didn't raise her,
you grew up with her.

688
00:59:55,554 --> 00:59:57,598
She couldn't stay a little girl forever,
that's why she left.

689
00:59:57,764 --> 01:00:00,642
She left because you got inside her head.

690
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:04,563
That's not my power.

691
01:00:06,565 --> 01:00:07,900
She made a choice.

692
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:10,903
But now we know where
that choice leads, don't we?

693
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:13,739
She's going to murder Trask,
they're going to capture her...

694
01:00:14,406 --> 01:00:16,658
and then they're going to wipe us out.

695
01:00:16,825 --> 01:00:18,744
Not if we get to her first.

696
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:22,164
Not if we change history tomorrow.

697
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:29,338
I'm sorry, Charles...

698
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:34,760
for what happened.

699
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:36,929
I truly am.

700
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:42,351
It's been a while since I've played.

701
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:46,814
I'll go easy on you.

702
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,609
Might finally be a fair fight.

703
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:53,320
You have the first move.

704
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:12,297
The diplomats from all around the world
are arriving here today at the Hotel Royal.

705
01:01:12,464 --> 01:01:13,882
It's an historic day.

706
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:19,179
It's the official ending of the United States'
military involvement in Vietnam.

707
01:01:19,346 --> 01:01:21,473
There we have
the South Vietnamese Foreign Minister...

708
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,308
with other South Vietnamese dignitaries.

709
01:01:24,226 --> 01:01:26,478
The Summit doesn't begin
for another hour.

710
01:01:26,645 --> 01:01:29,815
The hotel has arranged a private room
upstairs for your special guests.

711
01:01:29,982 --> 01:01:31,984
That will be plenty of time.

712
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:40,033
Good afternoon, everyone.
Hello, thank you for coming.

713
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,828
Congratulations on winning this war.

714
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:47,666
Now, I know you all have hands to shake
and photos to take downstairs...

715
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:49,877
so I will get right to the point.

716
01:01:50,669 --> 01:01:52,921
There is a new enemy out there.

717
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:55,591
An enemy that will
render your arsenals useless...

718
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:57,050
your armies powerless...

719
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:59,094
and your nations defenseless.

720
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:08,729
You will need a new weapon for this war.
I call them Sentinels.

721
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:14,443
Named after the ancient guardians
that stood at the gates of the citadel.

722
01:02:16,695 --> 01:02:19,531
They have the aeronautic capabilities
of a Harrier jet.

723
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:22,868
Armed with guns that can fire off...

724
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:27,039
more than 2,000 rounds per minute
of thermoceramic ammunition.

725
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:29,708
But size, power, speed...

726
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,793
you could find that at Lockheed or Boeing.

727
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,463
No, what makes the Sentinels
so special...

728
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:38,091
is the ability to target
the mutant X-gene.

729
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:42,429
A genetic guidance system that can
lock onto a mark a half a mile away.

730
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:45,599
It won't trigger
unless it has identified the target.

731
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:49,311
With this weapon, there will be
no human collateral damage.

732
01:02:49,478 --> 01:02:52,314
If I turn it on, the system
couldn't even activate in here.

733
01:03:00,072 --> 01:03:03,909
Unless there's a mutant.

734
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:15,170
There has to be a some kind of mistake.

735
01:03:16,797 --> 01:03:19,466
My machines don't make mistakes.

736
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:23,303
What are you?

737
01:03:24,263 --> 01:03:26,014
I assure you...

738
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,101
No, don't shoot it.

739
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:32,604
I assure you,
I don't know what you're talking about.

740
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:08,098
Raven!

741
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,397
Raven? Raven!

742
01:04:19,485 --> 01:04:20,819
Raven?

743
01:04:22,988 --> 01:04:24,156
Charles?

744
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:26,575
We've come for you, Erik and I.

745
01:04:26,742 --> 01:04:27,743
Together.

746
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:30,913
I never thought I'd see you again.

747
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:34,541
I made you a promise a long time ago
that I would protect you.

748
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:48,764
I'm going to keep you safe.

749
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:50,557
I'm going to keep you
out of their hands.

750
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,854
Erik?

751
01:04:57,022 --> 01:04:59,191
Erik? What are you doing?

752
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:02,402
Securing our future.

753
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:04,530
Forgive me, Mystique.

754
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:07,366
As long as you're out there,
we'll never be safe.

755
01:05:08,534 --> 01:05:09,660
Erik...

756
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:11,745
Use your power, Charles. Stop him.

757
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:13,038
He can't.

758
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:45,404
He's slipping back.

759
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:46,780
I'm losing him.

760
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:29,490
Stryker!

761
01:06:29,948 --> 01:06:31,992
Someone will finish
what we've started, Wolverine!

762
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:33,202
One day!

763
01:06:38,582 --> 01:06:39,583
Restrain him.

764
01:06:54,807 --> 01:06:55,808
Erik!

765
01:07:05,984 --> 01:07:07,152
Where am I?

766
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,323
How the hell did I get here?

767
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:13,075
What? You came to us.

768
01:07:14,076 --> 01:07:15,327
- Who are you?
- Charles.

769
01:07:15,828 --> 01:07:18,163
- Charles Xavier!
- I don't know you.

770
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:20,249
What the hell is that?

771
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,710
Look, I can deal with this. Just go.

772
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:25,379
Stop Erik!

773
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:28,173
- Erik, please...
- I'm sorry.

774
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,508
Erik...

775
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:50,571
You're Logan, that's Hank McCoy,
I'm Charles Xavier.

776
01:07:50,737 --> 01:07:53,198
You spent the last
couple of days with us.

777
01:07:56,577 --> 01:07:58,203
You're on acid.

778
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:03,083
Somebody gave you really bad acid, yeah?

779
01:08:47,753 --> 01:08:50,130
Just hold on tight,
we'll get through this together.

780
01:08:51,632 --> 01:08:52,925
Oh, my God, Kitty.

781
01:08:55,093 --> 01:08:56,094
She's wounded pretty bad.

782
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:02,494
I got him.

783
01:10:07,249 --> 01:10:08,250
Professor?

784
01:10:09,001 --> 01:10:10,085
What happened to you?

785
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:14,673
I just saw someone who's gonna
bring me a lot of pain someday.

786
01:10:17,509 --> 01:10:18,510
Where's Raven?

787
01:10:19,178 --> 01:10:20,429
- Gone.
- What?

788
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:22,556
We have to get out of here.

789
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:25,100
We want to know if there's
any sort of connection with...

790
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:33,317
Yesterday, the Paris Peace Summit...

791
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:36,195
was rocked by the appearance
of unidentified assailants...

792
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,655
the likes of which
the world has never seen.

793
01:10:38,822 --> 01:10:41,492
Mass hysteria has gripped the nation
as people ask...

794
01:10:41,658 --> 01:10:43,911
"Where did they come from?
Will they be back?"

795
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:46,997
And most importantly,
"Are they friend or foe?"

796
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:49,541
That was London correspondent
Toby Elliot...

797
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,043
reporting from the
Paris Peace Summit yesterday.

798
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,336
Fuck me.

799
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:57,549
What the hell are we dealing with here?
Off the record.

800
01:10:58,342 --> 01:11:01,720
Two days ago, this man,
Erik Lehnsherr...

801
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,389
escaped from a maximum security prison
inside the Pentagon.

802
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:08,268
We believe that this woman
is a former associate of Lehnsherr's.

803
01:11:08,602 --> 01:11:12,356
They were together in Cuba,
the day of the crisis in '62.

804
01:11:12,523 --> 01:11:16,193
He was also implicated
in Kennedy's assassination.

805
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:18,695
What about that thing?

806
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:20,364
We don't know what that thing is, sir.

807
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:22,825
Actually, we really don't know
what any of them are.

808
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:25,536
Yes. Yes, we do.

809
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:27,788
They're mutants.

810
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:33,126
He has the power to control metal.

811
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:36,129
Last I checked, that's what
most of your weapons were made of.

812
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:40,175
And she can transform into anyone.

813
01:11:40,342 --> 01:11:43,136
A general, a secret serviceman.

814
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:44,555
Even you, Mr. President.

815
01:11:45,222 --> 01:11:46,473
She could walk into this office...

816
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,310
and order a nuclear strike
if she was in the mood.

817
01:11:50,477 --> 01:11:52,062
And that's only two of them.

818
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:55,232
Do we have any countermeasures?
Any defense?

819
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:57,651
I was waiting for you
to ask me that question.

820
01:11:57,985 --> 01:12:01,738
That's an experimental program, sir.
Strictly off the books.

821
01:12:10,539 --> 01:12:13,208
You're telling me
these mutants are out in the world...

822
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:15,836
and our best defense
are these giant metal robots?

823
01:12:16,003 --> 01:12:18,046
Many of the mutants look like us.

824
01:12:18,505 --> 01:12:20,674
My Sentinels can tell the difference.

825
01:12:20,924 --> 01:12:23,218
I have eight prototypes ready to go.

826
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:27,055
They're built out of a space-age polymer,
not an ounce of metal on them.

827
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:35,022
I want to make a demonstration.

828
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:37,441
I want the world to know
that we can protect them.

829
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:39,651
What do you need
to get these things operational?

830
01:12:39,818 --> 01:12:41,361
I already gave that number to Congress.

831
01:12:41,528 --> 01:12:44,281
Unfortunately,
they elected to shut me down.

832
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:47,034
It's going to cost a bit more
to turn them on.

833
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:50,204
- Whatever you need.
- And one more thing.

834
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:53,790
If we do manage to capture them,
I would like her.

835
01:12:53,957 --> 01:12:55,876
For research purposes, of course.

836
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:59,796
I don't care who you screw,
as long as it's not me.

837
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,177
Terrible thing.

838
01:13:06,345 --> 01:13:07,763
What is?

839
01:13:08,347 --> 01:13:09,640
Being born like that.

840
01:13:09,723 --> 01:13:10,849
Is it?

841
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:13,477
Can you imagine...

842
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:16,396
Looking in the mirror and seeing that
staring back at you?

843
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:20,234
Yes, I can.

844
01:13:22,486 --> 01:13:25,113
Where do you think she comes from?

845
01:13:25,364 --> 01:13:28,158
You think she has a family?

846
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:31,370
Yes.

847
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:33,372
She does.

848
01:14:21,086 --> 01:14:25,215
If I see so much as a screw move,
I will jam this into your throat.

849
01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:27,551
How did you find me?

850
01:14:27,718 --> 01:14:29,219
You taught me well.

851
01:14:29,386 --> 01:14:31,722
It's been a long time
since we were this close.

852
01:14:33,223 --> 01:14:34,600
I missed you.

853
01:14:34,766 --> 01:14:36,435
You tried to kill me.

854
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:38,729
So the rest of us could live.

855
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:41,482
What do you mean?

856
01:14:42,065 --> 01:14:44,067
We received a message from the future.

857
01:14:44,234 --> 01:14:46,153
Don't lie to me.

858
01:14:46,778 --> 01:14:48,780
I never have, and I never will.

859
01:14:50,407 --> 01:14:55,287
Humans use your blood, your genes,
to create a weapon that wipes us all out.

860
01:14:55,454 --> 01:14:58,916
I was only doing what I thought
necessary to secure our future.

861
01:14:59,082 --> 01:15:02,252
So what's to stop me from killing you
right now and securing my future?

862
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,421
Nothing.

863
01:15:05,672 --> 01:15:07,591
It doesn't matter anymore.

864
01:15:07,758 --> 01:15:10,594
They have your DNA.
Your blood was on the street.

865
01:15:11,261 --> 01:15:12,596
Whose fault was that?

866
01:15:14,264 --> 01:15:15,682
Mine.

867
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,937
I've seen their plans.
They're creating a weapon.

868
01:15:20,103 --> 01:15:23,023
And now they have what they need
to take it further.

869
01:15:25,317 --> 01:15:28,654
We have to strike now,
while we still hold the upper hand.

870
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:33,534
I've seen too many friends die, Erik.

871
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:39,790
I don't want a war.
I only want the man who murdered them.

872
01:15:39,957 --> 01:15:41,458
This is war.

873
01:15:43,293 --> 01:15:45,128
What happened to you?

874
01:15:45,963 --> 01:15:48,215
Did you lose your way
while I was gone?

875
01:15:50,217 --> 01:15:52,302
Are you still Charles' Raven?

876
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:57,057
Or are you Mystique?

877
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:02,020
Trask is the enemy.

878
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:06,233
Killing one man isn't enough.

879
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:07,985
It never was for you.

880
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:10,571
Goodbye, Erik.

881
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:36,972
What happened?

882
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:38,682
- Come on.
- Can he walk?

883
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:40,017
He needs his treatment.

884
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:42,853
- I can hear them.
- I know. It's okay.

885
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:45,063
- Can you make it stop?
- I'll get them.

886
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:48,192
Hey, hey.

887
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:50,027
Pull yourself together.

888
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:51,695
It's not over yet.

889
01:16:54,865 --> 01:16:56,241
You don't believe that.

890
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,536
How do you know?

891
01:16:59,703 --> 01:17:01,371
As these go...

892
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:06,376
this comes back.

893
01:17:07,044 --> 01:17:09,379
They all come back.

894
01:17:14,551 --> 01:17:15,969
Look.

895
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,388
I'm still here...

896
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:20,933
and she's still out there.

897
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:25,229
We need your help, Charles.

898
01:17:25,813 --> 01:17:27,397
Not like this. I need you.

899
01:17:27,856 --> 01:17:31,109
We can't find Raven.
Not without your powers.

900
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:37,074
I added a little extra
because you missed a dose.

901
01:17:42,746 --> 01:17:43,914
Charles.

902
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:17,406
Hank, do me a favor.

903
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:20,409
Would you help me to my study, please?

904
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:27,166
Come on, I got you.

905
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:39,595
Are you sure about this?

906
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:43,098
Absolutely not.

907
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:51,815
This creature is extraordinary.

908
01:18:53,025 --> 01:18:56,778
Her genes could hold the key
to mutation itself.

909
01:18:56,862 --> 01:18:57,946
I need more.

910
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:00,866
That's all they were able to scrape off
the pavement in Paris.

911
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:02,201
More than blood.

912
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:04,495
I need brain tissue...

913
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:07,289
spinal fluid, bone marrow.

914
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:09,583
Imagine...

915
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:12,544
Sentinels that could transform,
adapt to any target.

916
01:19:13,337 --> 01:19:15,464
If I could just get my hands on her.

917
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:19,301
This girl could leap
the program forward years...

918
01:19:19,468 --> 01:19:21,345
decades into the future.

919
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:23,972
How old is your son now, Major?

920
01:19:25,307 --> 01:19:26,391
Jason?

921
01:19:26,558 --> 01:19:28,560
He's coming up on ten now,
if you can believe it.

922
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:30,145
Eight years from fighting age.

923
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:34,066
And how many of our sons and brothers
did we just ship home in body bags?

924
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:36,193
Maybe fifty, fifty-five thousand?

925
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,820
And how many more on the other side?

926
01:19:39,363 --> 01:19:41,198
Never before...

927
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:44,368
in all of human history...

928
01:19:44,535 --> 01:19:49,206
has there been a cause
which could unite us as a species.

929
01:19:50,207 --> 01:19:52,543
Until now.

930
01:19:53,836 --> 01:19:55,838
You really hate mutants, don't you?

931
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:59,341
On the contrary, I rather admire them.

932
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:00,592
The things they can do.

933
01:20:02,261 --> 01:20:05,222
I see mutants as our salvation.

934
01:20:05,389 --> 01:20:06,557
A common enemy.

935
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:10,519
A common struggle
against the ultimate enemy.

936
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:13,063
Extinction.

937
01:20:13,522 --> 01:20:14,523
I believe our new friends...

938
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:17,067
are going to help us
usher in a new era, Bill.

939
01:20:17,234 --> 01:20:19,570
A new era of genuine...

940
01:20:19,736 --> 01:20:22,489
and long-lasting peace.

941
01:20:36,461 --> 01:20:39,882
Attention, attention.
Transport departure in two hours.

942
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:44,052
Repeat.
Transport departure in two hours.

943
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:53,061
When was the last time
you were down here?

944
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:54,605
The last time we went looking for students.

945
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:56,607
A lifetime ago.

946
01:21:02,488 --> 01:21:04,656
Welcome, Professor.

947
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:30,349
Raven's wounded.
She won't be moving fast.

948
01:21:38,774 --> 01:21:41,109
These are muscles
I haven't stretched in a long time.

949
01:22:24,695 --> 01:22:25,696
Charles!

950
01:22:28,157 --> 01:22:29,241
Charles!

951
01:22:37,166 --> 01:22:39,960
Charles? It's all right.

952
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:44,339
I'll go check the generator.

953
01:22:52,097 --> 01:22:53,682
It's not the machinery, is it?

954
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:55,934
I can't do this. My mind...

955
01:22:56,059 --> 01:22:57,269
Yes, you can.

956
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:59,188
- It won't take it.
- You're just a little rusty.

957
01:22:59,271 --> 01:23:01,732
You don't understand.
It's not a question of being rusty.

958
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:03,650
I can flip the switches.
I can turn the knobs.

959
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:07,362
But my power comes from here.
It comes from...

960
01:23:08,071 --> 01:23:09,740
And it's broken.

961
01:23:10,866 --> 01:23:12,784
I feel like one of my students.

962
01:23:13,076 --> 01:23:14,369
Helpless.

963
01:23:15,746 --> 01:23:16,955
It was a mistake coming down here.

964
01:23:17,122 --> 01:23:18,665
It was a mistake freeing Erik.

965
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:21,126
This whole thing has been
one bloody mistake.

966
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:23,712
I'm sorry, Logan,
but they sent back the wrong man.

967
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:25,964
You're right.

968
01:23:27,299 --> 01:23:28,801
I am.

969
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:31,220
Actually, it was supposed to be you.

970
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:35,808
But I was the only one who could
physically make the trip.

971
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:39,520
And I don't know
how long I've got here.

972
01:23:39,978 --> 01:23:42,773
But I do know that a long time ago...

973
01:23:43,398 --> 01:23:45,776
actually, a long time from now...

974
01:23:46,109 --> 01:23:49,279
I was your most helpless student.

975
01:23:49,738 --> 01:23:52,115
And you unlocked my mind.

976
01:23:52,282 --> 01:23:54,952
You showed me what I was.

977
01:23:55,118 --> 01:23:56,954
You showed me what I could be.

978
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,122
I don't know how to do that for you.

979
01:23:59,289 --> 01:24:01,250
You're right. I don't.

980
01:24:03,126 --> 01:24:05,170
But I know someone who might.

981
01:24:07,297 --> 01:24:10,259
Look into my mind.

982
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:14,054
You saw what I did to Cerebro.
You don't want me inside your head.

983
01:24:14,138 --> 01:24:15,222
There's no damage you can do...

984
01:24:15,305 --> 01:24:16,682
that hasn't already been done.
Trust me.

985
01:24:16,974 --> 01:24:17,975
Come on.

986
01:24:29,444 --> 01:24:30,487
Hey.

987
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:33,448
Hey, Logan.

988
01:24:33,532 --> 01:24:34,533
Hi, Jean.

989
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:36,076
Kill me.

990
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,161
I love you.

991
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:44,918
You poor, poor man.

992
01:24:45,002 --> 01:24:46,170
Look past me.

993
01:24:46,336 --> 01:24:48,172
No, I don't want your suffering.

994
01:24:48,338 --> 01:24:50,257
I don't want your future!

995
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:52,468
Look past my future.

996
01:24:52,718 --> 01:24:54,845
Look for your future.

997
01:24:58,348 --> 01:24:59,683
That's it.

998
01:25:00,058 --> 01:25:01,310
That's it.

999
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:04,354
That's it.

1000
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:54,238
Charles.

1001
01:25:56,073 --> 01:25:57,449
Charles.

1002
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:04,081
So this is what becomes of us.

1003
01:26:05,374 --> 01:26:07,209
Erik was right.

1004
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:10,087
Humanity does this to us.

1005
01:26:10,254 --> 01:26:12,881
Not if we show them a better path.

1006
01:26:13,799 --> 01:26:15,467
You still believe?

1007
01:26:15,634 --> 01:26:18,095
Just because someone stumbles,
loses their way...

1008
01:26:18,262 --> 01:26:21,098
it doesn't mean they're lost forever.

1009
01:26:21,723 --> 01:26:25,477
Sometimes we all need a little help.

1010
01:26:26,436 --> 01:26:28,105
I'm not the man I was.

1011
01:26:30,274 --> 01:26:32,317
I open my mind...

1012
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:35,112
and it almost overwhelms me.

1013
01:26:35,445 --> 01:26:38,949
You're afraid,
and Cerebro knows it.

1014
01:26:40,117 --> 01:26:42,661
All those voices...

1015
01:26:44,413 --> 01:26:49,084
so much pain.

1016
01:26:49,459 --> 01:26:52,796
It's not their pain you're afraid of.

1017
01:26:52,963 --> 01:26:54,965
It's yours, Charles.

1018
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:58,760
And as frightening as it may be...

1019
01:26:58,927 --> 01:27:01,763
that pain will make you stronger.

1020
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:05,142
If you allow yourself to feel it...

1021
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:07,019
embrace it...

1022
01:27:08,187 --> 01:27:12,357
it will make you more powerful
than you ever imagined.

1023
01:27:12,524 --> 01:27:15,861
It's the greatest gift we have...

1024
01:27:16,028 --> 01:27:19,865
to bear their pain without breaking.

1025
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:21,825
And it's born...

1026
01:27:21,992 --> 01:27:24,369
from the most human power.

1027
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:26,955
Hope.

1028
01:27:36,048 --> 01:27:38,383
Please, Charles...

1029
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:42,513
we need you to hope again.

1030
01:27:50,813 --> 01:27:53,273
Find what you were looking for?

1031
01:27:59,071 --> 01:28:00,364
The power's back on.

1032
01:28:00,531 --> 01:28:01,824
Yes.

1033
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:04,576
Yes, it is.

1034
01:29:44,968 --> 01:29:46,428
She's lost too much blood.

1035
01:29:47,054 --> 01:29:48,388
She can't keep going like this.

1036
01:29:48,555 --> 01:29:50,682
We have no choice, Bobby.

1037
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:52,226
- We can wake him up.
- No!

1038
01:29:53,811 --> 01:29:55,103
They need more time.

1039
01:29:55,646 --> 01:29:57,689
I had...

1040
01:29:58,273 --> 01:30:00,275
a glimpse into the past.

1041
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:01,819
If we wake Logan now...

1042
01:30:01,985 --> 01:30:05,405
we may set our fate
on an even darker course.

1043
01:30:05,614 --> 01:30:07,366
They need more time.

1044
01:30:09,618 --> 01:30:11,578
There is someone else.

1045
01:30:11,662 --> 01:30:13,413
No, no one has Kitty's power.

1046
01:30:13,497 --> 01:30:17,209
Someone that could take her power,
take her place.

1047
01:30:18,585 --> 01:30:19,878
She took yours once.

1048
01:30:20,003 --> 01:30:20,963
Rogue.

1049
01:30:21,046 --> 01:30:23,590
I'm sorry, Bobby, she must be dead.

1050
01:30:23,674 --> 01:30:26,260
I haven't been able to make
a connection with her for years.

1051
01:30:26,343 --> 01:30:29,680
That's because they're keeping her
in the one place your mind can't reach

1052
01:30:29,763 --> 01:30:31,265
from the outside.

1053
01:30:31,348 --> 01:30:33,559
She's in Cerebro.

1054
01:30:33,767 --> 01:30:35,435
She's in your house, Professor.

1055
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:37,229
They're experimenting on her.

1056
01:30:37,604 --> 01:30:40,440
Trying to tap into her power,
so they can take ours.

1057
01:30:40,524 --> 01:30:41,525
Take all of ours.

1058
01:30:41,608 --> 01:30:43,402
If you knew this,
why didn't you go after her?

1059
01:30:43,485 --> 01:30:46,196
We tried. It's too heavily guarded.

1060
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:49,950
I may know a few things
about that house they don't.

1061
01:30:56,123 --> 01:30:58,542
Kitty, I'm going to get help.

1062
01:30:58,709 --> 01:31:00,878
I'm gonna bring back somebody
to help you.

1063
01:31:03,714 --> 01:31:06,592
Please, just bring yourself back.

1064
01:31:30,741 --> 01:31:32,201
Raven, stop.

1065
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,786
Stop running.

1066
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,288
Charles?

1067
01:31:38,332 --> 01:31:39,416
Where are you?

1068
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:40,709
Back at the house...

1069
01:31:40,792 --> 01:31:42,586
where you should be.

1070
01:31:42,753 --> 01:31:44,922
I need you to come home.

1071
01:31:45,631 --> 01:31:47,466
I know what I need to do.

1072
01:31:51,136 --> 01:31:52,346
If you kill Trask...

1073
01:31:52,429 --> 01:31:54,598
you will be creating countless more
just like him.

1074
01:31:55,265 --> 01:31:56,350
Then I'll kill them, too.

1075
01:31:56,475 --> 01:31:58,977
Those are Erik's words, not yours.

1076
01:32:02,648 --> 01:32:05,150
The girl I grew up with
wasn't capable of killing.

1077
01:32:05,275 --> 01:32:06,276
She was good...

1078
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:08,987
fair, full of compassion.

1079
01:32:10,322 --> 01:32:12,074
I have compassion.

1080
01:32:12,157 --> 01:32:13,659
Just not for Trask.

1081
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:15,452
He's murdered too many of us.

1082
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,291
Shut her down, Charles. Get in her head.

1083
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:22,918
She's not letting me in.

1084
01:32:23,085 --> 01:32:26,296
I'm barely holding on.
I'm not strong enough yet.

1085
01:32:34,429 --> 01:32:36,306
I know what Trask has done...

1086
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,976
but killing him
will not bring them back.

1087
01:32:39,643 --> 01:32:40,727
It will set you on a path...

1088
01:32:40,811 --> 01:32:42,813
from which there is no return.

1089
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,232
An endless cycle of killing.

1090
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:49,153
Us and them, until there is nothing left.

1091
01:32:49,987 --> 01:32:53,991
But we can stop it,
right now, you and I.

1092
01:32:54,908 --> 01:32:57,911
You just have to come home.

1093
01:32:59,288 --> 01:33:01,081
I have to?

1094
01:33:01,456 --> 01:33:02,916
You haven't changed at all, Charles.

1095
01:33:04,251 --> 01:33:05,335
Like I said...

1096
01:33:05,502 --> 01:33:07,838
I know exactly what I have to do.

1097
01:33:10,007 --> 01:33:11,508
You do?

1098
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:16,430
Then, wherever you go, I will find you.

1099
01:33:16,847 --> 01:33:20,684
And, Raven, if you make me, I will stop you.

1100
01:33:22,186 --> 01:33:23,520
Good luck, Charles.

1101
01:33:36,992 --> 01:33:37,993
Where is she?

1102
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,663
She's in an airport, boarding a plane.
She could be going anywhere.

1103
01:33:45,334 --> 01:33:47,127
Get some rest, Charles.

1104
01:33:47,211 --> 01:33:50,798
We'll track her in the morning
and find out exactly where she's going.

1105
01:33:54,009 --> 01:33:56,178
...rockets did land outside the base,

1106
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:59,014
killing five civilians
and wounding 12 others.

1107
01:34:00,974 --> 01:34:01,975
Yeah?

1108
01:34:05,771 --> 01:34:08,148
You know
that those things can give you cancer?

1109
01:34:08,232 --> 01:34:11,485
I've done
some toxicology tests in the lab, and...

1110
01:34:16,573 --> 01:34:17,908
You want something?

1111
01:34:19,076 --> 01:34:20,702
Yeah, I'm...

1112
01:34:22,246 --> 01:34:23,539
I know it's complicated,

1113
01:34:23,622 --> 01:34:27,167
and there's probably all kinds of rules
and reasons for what you can and can't say,

1114
01:34:28,544 --> 01:34:30,462
but I was wondering if you could tell me

1115
01:34:31,839 --> 01:34:34,758
in the future, do I make it?

1116
01:34:35,425 --> 01:34:36,510
No.

1117
01:34:39,805 --> 01:34:40,806
Okay.

1118
01:34:42,808 --> 01:34:44,434
It's okay. Thanks.

1119
01:34:44,518 --> 01:34:45,519
Hey, kid?

1120
01:34:48,564 --> 01:34:50,482
It's just the world I came from.

1121
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:02,286
We're going backwards in time.

1122
01:35:13,255 --> 01:35:16,550
Tomorrow, in front of the White House,
the President will make his announcement.

1123
01:35:16,633 --> 01:35:18,760
He will be joined
by Secretary of Defense Laird...

1124
01:35:18,886 --> 01:35:22,514
and has even sought the help
of renowned scientist Bolivar Trask...

1125
01:35:22,681 --> 01:35:25,225
his special advisor
to combat this mutant issue.

1126
01:35:25,684 --> 01:35:29,354
The White House has all three networks
to air the event live,

1127
01:35:29,438 --> 01:35:33,192
as it is a matter of importance
not only to the United States,

1128
01:35:33,275 --> 01:35:35,736
but to every citizen from around the globe.

1129
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:37,613
There are no other details
about the event...

1130
01:35:46,663 --> 01:35:47,956
Raven...

1131
01:35:48,707 --> 01:35:50,584
My God.

1132
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:53,212
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

1133
01:35:54,755 --> 01:35:56,340
I...

1134
01:35:57,216 --> 01:36:01,094
I guess,
I just realized I have nowhere else to go.

1135
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:04,973
- I've gotta wake Charles...
- No, don't.

1136
01:36:05,682 --> 01:36:07,017
Just wait.

1137
01:36:21,615 --> 01:36:24,660
You really shouldn't walk on this.

1138
01:36:24,743 --> 01:36:27,287
I've had worse.

1139
01:36:27,371 --> 01:36:30,415
So, you've been living here all these years?

1140
01:36:30,499 --> 01:36:32,167
Someone had to take care of Charles.

1141
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:36,630
You know, he's missed you.

1142
01:36:36,797 --> 01:36:39,883
He misses who I was.

1143
01:36:40,884 --> 01:36:45,222
I'm not who he wants me to be anymore.

1144
01:36:47,766 --> 01:36:49,476
I've missed you.

1145
01:36:51,353 --> 01:36:53,772
So, you're like this all the time now.

1146
01:36:53,856 --> 01:36:54,857
Like what?

1147
01:36:55,357 --> 01:36:56,358
This.

1148
01:36:58,694 --> 01:37:00,445
No, not all the time.

1149
01:37:00,529 --> 01:37:04,283
I take a shot in the morning,
and I need another if I get worked up.

1150
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:08,787
- Worked up?
- Yeah, yeah, when I'm...

1151
01:37:08,954 --> 01:37:12,457
...emotional or excited.

1152
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:17,713
Any animal urges.

1153
01:37:20,591 --> 01:37:22,342
Usually, I can fight them off.

1154
01:37:22,509 --> 01:37:26,054
Well, maybe, we shouldn't have to fight off
the things that come naturally to us.

1155
01:37:59,797 --> 01:38:02,925
Do you remember one of the last things
you said to me?

1156
01:38:04,134 --> 01:38:07,846
That I would never be deemed beautiful,
looking like this?

1157
01:38:10,974 --> 01:38:13,310
Do you still think that?

1158
01:38:13,477 --> 01:38:16,313
Maybe. You saw what happened in Paris.

1159
01:38:17,815 --> 01:38:19,733
You know what they think of us.

1160
01:38:21,026 --> 01:38:22,402
What do you think?

1161
01:38:30,285 --> 01:38:32,412
I think you're beautiful.

1162
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,832
What about yourself?

1163
01:38:42,589 --> 01:38:45,217
You should get some rest.

1164
01:38:48,345 --> 01:38:49,638
I'm glad you're home.

1165
01:38:55,727 --> 01:38:57,187
Hank?

1166
01:38:58,355 --> 01:39:01,483
Do you remember
the last thing I said to you?

1167
01:39:05,487 --> 01:39:08,615
It was, "Mutant and proud."

1168
01:39:35,851 --> 01:39:40,063
The old gas and water pipes
lead straight to the house.

1169
01:39:45,986 --> 01:39:48,447
The walls are made of reinforced steel.

1170
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:50,449
In other words, a door.

1171
01:40:02,044 --> 01:40:05,422
You're walking directly over the hall now.

1172
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:02,187
I've been on that slab.
Let me show you how it feels.

1173
01:41:08,777 --> 01:41:10,946
Rogue, Rogue, come on. Wake up.

1174
01:41:14,491 --> 01:41:15,742
Rogue.

1175
01:41:16,827 --> 01:41:19,288
Come on, Rogue, wake up.
Wake up, it's me.

1176
01:41:27,796 --> 01:41:28,797
No.

1177
01:41:51,862 --> 01:41:54,865
Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, it's okay.
He's with me.

1178
01:41:54,990 --> 01:41:56,116
We're gonna get you out of here.

1179
01:42:17,012 --> 01:42:18,180
Erik, Bobby.

1180
01:42:18,388 --> 01:42:19,890
Get out of there! Now!

1181
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:39,159
Take her!

1182
01:42:39,743 --> 01:42:41,495
Bobby! No!

1183
01:42:44,373 --> 01:42:45,374
Bobby!

1184
01:42:59,596 --> 01:43:00,764
Bobby!

1185
01:43:35,257 --> 01:43:36,341
Professor!

1186
01:43:38,177 --> 01:43:39,970
Get us out of here.

1187
01:43:40,053 --> 01:43:41,889
- Bobby.
- I know.

1188
01:45:20,237 --> 01:45:21,989
I'm sorry, Charles.

1189
01:45:50,601 --> 01:45:52,269
Where's Bobby?

1190
01:45:54,229 --> 01:45:55,939
I'm sorry, Kitty.

1191
01:46:32,976 --> 01:46:34,102
Hello, Logan.

1192
01:46:43,904 --> 01:46:44,905
Rogue.

1193
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:49,326
Raven was here.

1194
01:46:49,493 --> 01:46:51,036
- I screwed up.
- Shit.

1195
01:47:03,048 --> 01:47:04,508
We can't track her now.

1196
01:47:06,802 --> 01:47:08,428
She's cut her ties.

1197
01:47:11,306 --> 01:47:13,142
Hey, I saw in the news last night

1198
01:47:13,225 --> 01:47:15,602
there's going to be an announcement
in Washington this afternoon

1199
01:47:15,686 --> 01:47:17,938
about a new protocol for mutants.

1200
01:47:20,107 --> 01:47:22,109
I set the system I designed...

1201
01:47:22,192 --> 01:47:24,570
to record any news about Paris
over all three networks...

1202
01:47:24,945 --> 01:47:26,029
and PBS.

1203
01:47:26,446 --> 01:47:28,031
All three? Wow.

1204
01:47:28,323 --> 01:47:30,033
Yeah, and PBS.

1205
01:47:31,034 --> 01:47:32,411
Look what I found.

1206
01:47:32,578 --> 01:47:35,456
Tomorrow, in front of the White House,
the President will make his announcement.

1207
01:47:35,998 --> 01:47:38,167
He will be joined
by Secretary of Defense Laird...

1208
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:41,920
and has even sought the help
of renowned scientist Bolivar Trask...

1209
01:47:42,087 --> 01:47:45,591
his special advisor
to combat this mutant issue.

1210
01:47:45,757 --> 01:47:46,842
The White House has asked...

1211
01:47:46,925 --> 01:47:48,093
Raven doesn't realize...

1212
01:47:48,177 --> 01:47:50,053
that if she kills Trask
at an event like that...

1213
01:47:50,137 --> 01:47:52,556
with the whole world watching...

1214
01:47:53,307 --> 01:47:55,767
Then I came a long way for nothing.

1215
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:58,270
And there's more bad news.
I saw in a report...

1216
01:47:58,854 --> 01:48:00,355
they found traces of her blood in Paris.

1217
01:48:00,731 --> 01:48:03,692
For all we know,
they already have her DNA...

1218
01:48:03,859 --> 01:48:04,985
which is all they'd need.

1219
01:48:05,068 --> 01:48:07,237
To create the Sentinels of the future.

1220
01:48:10,782 --> 01:48:12,826
There's a theory in quantum physics...

1221
01:48:12,910 --> 01:48:14,495
that time is immutable.

1222
01:48:14,745 --> 01:48:16,580
It's like a river.
You can throw a pebble into it...

1223
01:48:16,663 --> 01:48:19,958
and create a ripple, but the current
always corrects itself.

1224
01:48:20,876 --> 01:48:24,630
No matter what you do, the river
just keeps flowing in the same direction.

1225
01:48:25,047 --> 01:48:26,340
What are you trying to say?

1226
01:48:26,507 --> 01:48:28,425
What I'm saying is...

1227
01:48:28,592 --> 01:48:30,135
what if the war is inevitable?

1228
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:32,638
What if she's meant to kill Trask?

1229
01:48:34,181 --> 01:48:36,725
What if this is just simply who she is?

1230
01:48:38,769 --> 01:48:42,731
Just because someone stumbles,
loses their way...

1231
01:48:42,898 --> 01:48:44,900
doesn't mean they're lost forever.

1232
01:48:49,738 --> 01:48:52,449
No, I don't believe that theory, Hank.

1233
01:48:53,325 --> 01:48:56,328
And I cannot believe
that is who she is.

1234
01:48:57,621 --> 01:48:58,705
Ready the plane.

1235
01:48:58,789 --> 01:49:01,125
We're going to Washington.

1236
01:49:18,308 --> 01:49:19,810
You all right?

1237
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:21,103
Getting there.

1238
01:49:25,774 --> 01:49:28,443
Whatever happens today,
I need you to promise me something.

1239
01:49:29,319 --> 01:49:32,447
You've looked into my mind
and seen a lot of bad...

1240
01:49:33,323 --> 01:49:34,992
but you've seen the good, too.

1241
01:49:36,034 --> 01:49:37,703
The X-Men.

1242
01:49:38,954 --> 01:49:40,539
Promise me you'll find us.

1243
01:49:42,332 --> 01:49:44,334
Use your power, bring us together.

1244
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,045
Guide us. Lead us.

1245
01:49:48,714 --> 01:49:51,508
Storm. Scott.

1246
01:49:53,677 --> 01:49:55,012
Jean.

1247
01:49:56,346 --> 01:49:58,515
Remember those names.

1248
01:49:59,516 --> 01:50:01,852
There are so many of us.

1249
01:50:02,519 --> 01:50:04,855
We will need you, Professor.

1250
01:50:07,816 --> 01:50:10,235
I'll do my best.

1251
01:50:10,402 --> 01:50:12,070
Your best is enough.

1252
01:50:13,989 --> 01:50:15,699
Trust me.

1253
01:50:39,681 --> 01:50:42,142
There's 12 carriers inbound, 10 miles!

1254
01:50:43,143 --> 01:50:44,228
They've found us.

1255
01:51:01,286 --> 01:51:03,455
Thousands of people
will be gathered here today.

1256
01:51:03,539 --> 01:51:04,915
They've come from all over the world...

1257
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,835
to witness history,
along with news crews...

1258
01:51:08,001 --> 01:51:09,545
from at least 50 different countries.

1259
01:51:11,255 --> 01:51:12,589
Thank you.

1260
01:51:14,967 --> 01:51:16,135
Can I see your invitations, please?

1261
01:51:17,136 --> 01:51:18,387
Yes, you may.

1262
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:19,638
These two are with me.

1263
01:51:19,721 --> 01:51:20,722
Go ahead.

1264
01:51:20,806 --> 01:51:21,932
Thank you.

1265
01:51:28,730 --> 01:51:30,107
Logan!

1266
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:31,441
Please, this way, sir.

1267
01:51:50,711 --> 01:51:54,590
Fourth infantry...
Took a Bouncing Betty.

1268
01:51:55,841 --> 01:51:57,259
What happened to you?

1269
01:51:58,343 --> 01:51:59,553
Friendly fire.

1270
01:52:00,596 --> 01:52:01,597
The worst kind.

1271
01:52:01,805 --> 01:52:03,098
Yeah.

1272
01:52:17,154 --> 01:52:18,989
I haven't found her yet,
but she has to be here.

1273
01:52:19,156 --> 01:52:20,699
The President of the United States.

1274
01:52:43,597 --> 01:52:45,265
My fellow Americans...

1275
01:52:45,432 --> 01:52:50,103
today we face the gravest threat
in our history...

1276
01:52:50,270 --> 01:52:51,396
mutants.

1277
01:52:54,608 --> 01:52:56,985
We have prepared for this threat.

1278
01:52:59,988 --> 01:53:03,617
In the immortal words
of Robert Oppenheimer...

1279
01:53:03,784 --> 01:53:04,868
"Behold.

1280
01:53:05,452 --> 01:53:08,247
The world will never be the same again."

1281
01:53:38,819 --> 01:53:39,820
Can I help you?

1282
01:53:43,157 --> 01:53:44,366
No, you can't.

1283
01:54:27,784 --> 01:54:28,994
Here they come.

1284
01:54:35,709 --> 01:54:37,377
This is for you, brothers and sisters.

1285
01:54:39,922 --> 01:54:41,048
Raven?

1286
01:54:43,759 --> 01:54:44,843
I have her.

1287
01:54:45,511 --> 01:54:46,720
Let me go, Charles.

1288
01:54:48,889 --> 01:54:50,349
There. You see?

1289
01:54:50,516 --> 01:54:51,600
Secret Serviceman.

1290
01:54:51,767 --> 01:54:52,893
Left of the stage.

1291
01:54:52,976 --> 01:54:54,061
- Got him.
- Go.

1292
01:55:14,915 --> 01:55:16,208
What the hell are you doing?

1293
01:55:16,291 --> 01:55:17,709
I didn't tell you to activate them.

1294
01:55:17,793 --> 01:55:18,961
I didn't.

1295
01:55:37,563 --> 01:55:39,439
Raven, please, listen to me.

1296
01:55:39,940 --> 01:55:44,069
We've been given a second chance
to define who we are.

1297
01:55:46,113 --> 01:55:47,489
Don't do this.

1298
01:55:50,909 --> 01:55:53,162
Gentlemen, you cannot pass this point.

1299
01:56:01,003 --> 01:56:02,754
We can't stop that many.

1300
01:56:02,921 --> 01:56:05,799
No, but we can slow them down.

1301
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:45,339
Erik!

1302
01:57:30,175 --> 01:57:31,885
Storm!

1303
01:57:50,279 --> 01:57:51,697
Go, go, go!

1304
01:58:07,713 --> 01:58:08,797
Go, go, go!

1305
01:58:08,881 --> 01:58:10,257
Take us to DEFCON 3.

1306
01:58:10,424 --> 01:58:11,592
Mr. President, we are Code Red.

1307
01:58:11,717 --> 01:58:13,093
What's our air defense readiness?

1308
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:14,511
All our air defenses are ready one.

1309
01:58:14,595 --> 01:58:16,013
What the hell happened out there?

1310
01:58:16,096 --> 01:58:17,181
I will fix it.

1311
01:58:17,264 --> 01:58:18,307
You said that before.

1312
01:58:18,432 --> 01:58:19,641
I wanted to make a statement.

1313
01:58:19,766 --> 01:58:22,561
Now the whole goddamn world
knows we can't protect them.

1314
01:58:22,644 --> 01:58:23,729
I will fix it.

1315
01:58:23,812 --> 01:58:25,606
You damn well better.

1316
01:59:37,052 --> 01:59:38,053
Charles!

1317
02:00:27,102 --> 02:00:28,854
Is everybody okay?

1318
02:01:02,721 --> 02:01:04,306
No!

1319
02:01:07,434 --> 02:01:08,477
Behind you.

1320
02:02:30,309 --> 02:02:31,935
Do what you were made for.

1321
02:02:41,111 --> 02:02:42,613
Where are you?

1322
02:02:59,963 --> 02:03:01,465
I got this! Go!

1323
02:03:44,258 --> 02:03:45,884
Oh, dear God, no.

1324
02:04:01,817 --> 02:04:04,027
So much for being a survivor.

1325
02:04:46,445 --> 02:04:47,738
One of them is in here.

1326
02:04:50,365 --> 02:04:52,117
No, no, no! Don't kill it!

1327
02:04:52,785 --> 02:04:53,869
I need it alive.

1328
02:05:07,299 --> 02:05:08,926
What the hell has happened?

1329
02:06:16,702 --> 02:06:18,912
You built these weapons to destroy us.

1330
02:06:19,872 --> 02:06:21,582
Why?

1331
02:06:25,169 --> 02:06:27,880
Because you are afraid of our gifts.

1332
02:06:28,839 --> 02:06:31,341
Because we are different.

1333
02:06:32,509 --> 02:06:35,846
Humanity has always feared
that which is different.

1334
02:06:36,513 --> 02:06:37,890
Well, I am here to tell you...

1335
02:06:38,098 --> 02:06:39,516
to tell the world...

1336
02:06:40,517 --> 02:06:42,686
you are right to fear us.

1337
02:06:43,061 --> 02:06:44,771
We are the future.

1338
02:06:45,522 --> 02:06:48,192
We are the ones
who will inherit this earth.

1339
02:06:48,442 --> 02:06:51,028
And anyone who stands in our way...

1340
02:06:51,195 --> 02:06:53,197
will suffer the same fate
as these men...

1341
02:06:53,363 --> 02:06:54,698
you see before you.

1342
02:07:01,914 --> 02:07:04,541
Today was meant to be a display
of your power.

1343
02:07:05,292 --> 02:07:07,377
Instead I give you a glimpse...

1344
02:07:07,544 --> 02:07:11,048
of the devastation my race
can unleash upon yours.

1345
02:07:20,265 --> 02:07:22,434
Let this be a warning to the world.

1346
02:07:23,143 --> 02:07:25,938
And to my mutant
brothers and sisters out there...

1347
02:07:26,730 --> 02:07:28,148
I say this.

1348
02:07:28,899 --> 02:07:30,567
No more hiding.

1349
02:07:30,734 --> 02:07:32,569
No more suffering.

1350
02:07:33,403 --> 02:07:35,781
You have lived in the shadows...

1351
02:07:35,948 --> 02:07:38,784
in shame and fear for too long.
Come out.

1352
02:07:40,035 --> 02:07:41,370
Join me.

1353
02:07:41,453 --> 02:07:44,957
Fight together in a brotherhood of our kind.

1354
02:07:45,582 --> 02:07:47,251
A new tomorrow...

1355
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:50,254
that starts today.

1356
02:07:57,553 --> 02:07:59,388
All those years wasted...

1357
02:07:59,555 --> 02:08:01,557
fighting each other, Charles.

1358
02:08:05,102 --> 02:08:08,730
To have a precious few of them back...

1359
02:08:23,245 --> 02:08:24,455
- Mr. President, sir.
- Stand down.

1360
02:08:24,538 --> 02:08:26,415
I said, stand down!

1361
02:08:28,250 --> 02:08:29,918
You want to make a statement?

1362
02:08:30,377 --> 02:08:32,129
Kill me. Fine.

1363
02:08:32,296 --> 02:08:34,256
But spare everyone else.

1364
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:48,812
Very heroic, Mr. President...

1365
02:08:49,313 --> 02:08:50,814
but you had no intention...

1366
02:08:50,939 --> 02:08:53,150
of sparing any of us.

1367
02:08:53,609 --> 02:08:56,945
The future of our species begins now.

1368
02:09:32,481 --> 02:09:33,649
You used to be a better shot.

1369
02:09:33,732 --> 02:09:34,983
Trust me, I still am.

1370
02:09:48,831 --> 02:09:50,332
Get out of my head, Charles!

1371
02:09:50,499 --> 02:09:52,000
Raven.

1372
02:09:52,167 --> 02:09:54,044
Please, do not make us the enemy today.

1373
02:09:54,253 --> 02:09:56,088
Look around you.
We already are.

1374
02:09:56,588 --> 02:09:58,340
Not all of us.

1375
02:09:58,549 --> 02:10:00,801
All you've done so far...

1376
02:10:01,135 --> 02:10:03,137
is save the lives of these men.

1377
02:10:04,179 --> 02:10:06,723
You can show them a better path.

1378
02:10:10,394 --> 02:10:11,854
Shut her down, Charles.

1379
02:10:14,898 --> 02:10:17,734
I've been trying to control you
ever since the day we met...

1380
02:10:18,152 --> 02:10:20,154
and look where that's got us.

1381
02:10:22,281 --> 02:10:25,117
Everything that happens now...

1382
02:10:25,742 --> 02:10:27,953
is in your hands.

1383
02:10:31,999 --> 02:10:34,751
I have faith in you, Raven.

1384
02:12:11,765 --> 02:12:13,892
He's all yours, Charles.

1385
02:12:41,462 --> 02:12:44,089
If you let them have me,
I'm as good as dead.

1386
02:12:44,256 --> 02:12:45,632
You know that.

1387
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:47,885
I know.

1388
02:12:49,887 --> 02:12:51,555
Goodbye, old friend.

1389
02:12:54,224 --> 02:12:56,059
Goodbye, Erik.

1390
02:13:29,468 --> 02:13:31,470
Are you sure you should let them go?

1391
02:13:32,429 --> 02:13:33,806
Yes.

1392
02:13:34,431 --> 02:13:36,141
I have hope for them.

1393
02:13:37,309 --> 02:13:41,313
There's going to be a time, Hank,
when we are all together.

1394
02:13:45,192 --> 02:13:47,152
What about Logan?

1395
02:15:02,769 --> 02:15:06,023
Buckminster Fuller is a
great example of an architect...

1396
02:15:06,106 --> 02:15:10,360
whose ideas were very similar
to those of a utopian future.

1397
02:15:16,700 --> 02:15:19,369
Good morning, Logan. Late start.

1398
02:15:29,463 --> 02:15:30,798
Have a good lunch.

1399
02:15:30,964 --> 02:15:32,216
Good job.

1400
02:15:32,549 --> 02:15:33,884
Very good job.

1401
02:15:34,760 --> 02:15:36,345
Storm.

1402
02:16:07,417 --> 02:16:08,502
Jean.

1403
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:11,255
Hey, Logan.

1404
02:16:11,797 --> 02:16:12,923
Jean.

1405
02:16:13,632 --> 02:16:15,342
Are you okay?

1406
02:16:17,094 --> 02:16:18,512
You're here.

1407
02:16:19,138 --> 02:16:21,181
Where else would I be?

1408
02:16:23,475 --> 02:16:24,476
Whoa.

1409
02:16:25,310 --> 02:16:27,271
Easy, pal.

1410
02:16:28,814 --> 02:16:31,358
Well, some things never change.

1411
02:16:32,776 --> 02:16:34,361
It's good to see you, Scott.

1412
02:16:36,155 --> 02:16:37,406
Uh-huh.

1413
02:16:37,489 --> 02:16:38,657
See you later, Jean.

1414
02:16:42,786 --> 02:16:44,329
Professor.

1415
02:16:44,788 --> 02:16:47,583
Logan, is everything all right?

1416
02:16:50,961 --> 02:16:52,421
Yeah.

1417
02:16:53,464 --> 02:16:55,299
Yeah, I think it is.

1418
02:17:11,857 --> 02:17:13,066
You did it.

1419
02:17:13,150 --> 02:17:14,401
Did what?

1420
02:17:14,485 --> 02:17:16,487
Logan, don't you have a class to teach?

1421
02:17:17,154 --> 02:17:18,822
A class to teach?

1422
02:17:19,865 --> 02:17:20,949
History.

1423
02:17:21,658 --> 02:17:23,160
History?

1424
02:17:23,994 --> 02:17:25,662
Actually, I could use some help with that.

1425
02:17:26,163 --> 02:17:27,664
Help with what?

1426
02:17:27,831 --> 02:17:31,335
Pretty much everything after 1973.

1427
02:17:35,881 --> 02:17:38,926
I think the history I know
is a little different.

1428
02:17:40,552 --> 02:17:42,262
Welcome back.

1429
02:17:45,015 --> 02:17:46,683
It's good to see you, Charles.

1430
02:17:48,060 --> 02:17:49,895
It's good to see everyone.

1431
02:17:50,062 --> 02:17:51,563
Well...

1432
02:17:52,189 --> 02:17:54,358
I had a promise to keep.

1433
02:17:55,526 --> 02:17:58,779
You and I have
a lot of catching up to do.

1434
02:17:59,696 --> 02:18:01,198
Yeah.

1435
02:18:04,743 --> 02:18:06,870
What's the last thing you remember?

1436
02:18:11,959 --> 02:18:13,710
Drowning.

1437
02:18:21,969 --> 02:18:23,220
The past.

1438
02:18:24,721 --> 02:18:25,973
A new...

1439
02:18:26,056 --> 02:18:27,808
and uncertain world.

1440
02:18:39,236 --> 02:18:41,530
A world of endless possibilities.

1441
02:18:44,241 --> 02:18:46,410
And infinite outcomes.

1442
02:18:48,078 --> 02:18:49,204
You kidding me?

1443
02:18:49,329 --> 02:18:50,789
He's alive!

1444
02:18:55,169 --> 02:18:57,921
Countless choices define our fate.

1445
02:18:58,839 --> 02:19:01,300
Each choice, each moment...

1446
02:19:01,467 --> 02:19:04,094
a ripple in the river of time.

1447
02:19:04,261 --> 02:19:06,597
What do you want us to do with him,
Major Stryker?

1448
02:19:06,763 --> 02:19:08,515
Enough ripples...

1449
02:19:08,682 --> 02:19:11,268
and you change the tide.

1450
02:19:11,435 --> 02:19:12,519
I'll take him from here.

1451
02:19:12,686 --> 02:19:16,607
For the future is never truly set.
