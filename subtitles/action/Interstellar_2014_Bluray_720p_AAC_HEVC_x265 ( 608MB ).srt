Yeah, he's got a knack for it.
What about college?

Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.

But she's been having a little trouble lately.

226
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,245
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

227
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,915
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.

228
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,375
She always loved the pictures.

229
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,254
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

234
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,567
The Soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources...

235
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,985
...into rockets and other useless machines.

236
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,238
"Useless machines."

If we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

238
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:26,453
...we need to teach our kids about this planet,
not tales of leaving it.

One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

240
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,004
If we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

241
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,924
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

242
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,177
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

243
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,431
...which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...

244
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:47,517

00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,269
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.

246
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,191
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates over this...

247
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,025
...Apollo nonsense.

248
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:59,653

Um, there's a game tomorrow night.

251

The Lazarus missions.

- Lazarus came back from the dead.

Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

There's not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life...

00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,909
...and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

467
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,746
That doesn't even qualify as futile.

almost 50 years ago.

486
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,309
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

487
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,605
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

00:31:39,271 --> 00:31:41,273
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> Yeah, over the Straights.

<font color="#808080">ROMILLY :</font> Exactly.

491
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,451
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

492
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:54,621
Out near Saturn...

493
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,873
...a disturbance of space-time.

494
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,128
- Is that a Wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

495
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:04,506
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> And it leads where?

00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,679

they appear to be looking out for us.

501

That Wormhole lets us travel to other stars.

502
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:24,276

00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,087
...the bravest humans ever to live...

511
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,883
...led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

512
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,385
<font color="#808080">DOYLE :</font> Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

513
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,512
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

514
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,892
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

515
00:32:57,057 --> 00:33:00,895
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

516
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,650
...then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

517
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,861
And what if the world didn't show promise?

518
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,904
Hence the bravery.

519
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:13,240
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

520
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:14,534
No.

521
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,204
Data transmission back through
the Wormhole is rudimentary.

522
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:23,417
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

523
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,377
And one system shows promise.

524
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:28,256
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

525
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:31,926
<font color="#808080">AMELIA :</font> One system with three potential worlds?

526
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,929
No long shot.

527
00:33:36,096 --> 00:33:37,223
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> Okay.

528
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,268
So if we find a home...

00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,398
...then what?
- That's the long shot.

530
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:49,944
<font color="#808080">PROF. BRAND :</font> There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

531
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:53,405
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

532
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,045
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font>
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

533
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,882
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

534
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,967
<font color="#808080">PROF. BRAND :</font>
Both. Plan A.

535
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,219
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> How do you get it off the ground?

536
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,056
<font color="#808080">PROF. BRAND :</font> The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

537
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,728
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

538
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:28,733
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

539
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,193
But you haven't solved it yet.

540
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,822
<font color="#808080">AMELIA :</font> That's why there's Plan B.

541
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:39,034
The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet.

542
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,494
This is one way.

543
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,331
Plan B: a population bomb.

544
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:48,420
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

545
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,630
How would you raise them?

546
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,257
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

547
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:57,304
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

548
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,307
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

549
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,853
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

550
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,021
This takes care of that.

551
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,648
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> But what about the people here? You just...

552
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,358

00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,235
My kids?

554
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:17,114
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

555
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,244
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

556

-The relay on this side cached them.

884
01:02:12,269 --> 01:02:15,815
So years of basic data. No real surprises.

885
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:20,570
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,
as has Dr. Mann's. Um...

886
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,864
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

887
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,240
Transmitter failure?

888
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,409
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark.

889
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,329
But Miller's still looks good though, right?

890
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,789
- Because she's coming up fast.
<font color="#808080">DOYLE :</font> Mm-hm.

891
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,251
With one complication.

892
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,670
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

893
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:40,507
<font color="#808080">COOPER :</font> Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.

894
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:42,967
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.

895
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:46,346
- And Miller's is on the horizon?
<font color="#808080">ROMILLY :</font> As a basketball around a hoop.

896

897
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:51,934
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

<font color="#808080">AMELIA :</font> Okay. Cooper's right.

916
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:51,911
We need to think of time as a resource,

917
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:55,456
<font color="#808080">DOYLE :</font> All right, look.

918
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:00,210
Dr. Mann's data is promising,
but it will take months to get there.

919
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,588
And Edmunds', it's even further.

920
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:06,925
Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has
is very promising. It's water, it's organics...

921
01:04:07,092 --> 01:04:09,262
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.

922
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,764
And just think about the resources,
including time...

923
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,434
...that would be spent
trying to get back here.

924
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:17,353
- Romilly...
- Yeah?

925
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:21,358
...how far off from Miller's planet
do we have to be to stay out of the time shift?

926
01:04:21,523 --> 01:04:23,193
Just back from the cusp.

927
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,320
All right, which is here,
just outside of Miller's planet.

928
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:28,280
<font color="#808080">ROMILLY :</font> Right.
-Okay.

929
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,992
Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.

930
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:35,329
Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit
around Miller's planet...

931
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:38,375
...which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...

932
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:42,628
...what if we take a wider orbit around
Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...

933
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:45,297
...outside of this time shift, to here?

934
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,259
Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.

935
01:04:48,425 --> 01:04:51,137
We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
We're in, we're out.

936
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,639
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.

937
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,641
- That'll work.
- That's good.

938
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,268
There's no time for monkey business
or chit-chat down there.

939
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,231
So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.

940

941

I could use the time to research gravity.

942

1169
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:59,038

the underlying assumption about time.

It's recursive. It's nonsensical.

Edmunds's data would have soured.

- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

01:26:19,256 --> 01:26:23,679
...but no life. Sterile.
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.

01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:25,764
Because of the black hole?

1238

Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.

1239

Accident is the first building block
of evolution.

1240
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,605
But when you're orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.

1241
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:39,069
It sucks in asteroids and comets,
other events which would otherwise reach you.

We need to go further afield.

We're only here because of him.

And yet... Yet here he is.

1247
01:26:52,998 --> 01:26:57,962
He's on the ground, and he's sending
a very unambiguous message, telling us...

...to come to his planet.

You're a scientist, Brand.

So listen to me...

1261
01:27:37,793 --> 01:27:42,506
...when I say that love
isn't something we invented. It's...

1262
01:27:43,507 --> 01:27:45,844
...observable, powerful.

1263
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,639
It has to mean something.

1264
01:27:49,805 --> 01:27:54,185
Love has meaning, yes.
Social utility, social bonding, child rearing...

1265
01:27:54,351 --> 01:27:57,855
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

1266
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,440
None.

1267
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:03,487
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

1268
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:05,697
...yet understand.

1269
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:09,326
Maybe it's some evidence, some...

1270
01:28:10,284 --> 01:28:14,747
...artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.

I'm drawn across the universe

1272
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:22,713
...who I know is probably dead.

1273
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:26,384
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving...

1274
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:29,386
...that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1275
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:35,560
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

1276
01:28:40,564 --> 01:28:42,234
All right, Cooper...
