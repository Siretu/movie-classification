1
00:00:01,213 --> 00:00:03,213
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,758
Can't say that I have.

3
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:10,344
You, Pip?

4
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:14,223
What do they look like?

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:21,355
I don't remember now.

6
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:41,667
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

7
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:45,046
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

8
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,633
<i>... whose mind is overthrown.</i>

9
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,054
<i>Saruman 's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.</i>

10
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,849
My lord, your son...

11
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,227
... he is dead.

12
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,522
My lord?

13
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:04,982
Uncle?

14
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:14,075
Will you not go to him?

15
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,580
Will you do nothing?

16
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,749
Be careful what you say.

17
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,085
Do not look for welcome here.

18
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:52,280
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

19
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,615
What a tragedy for the king...

20
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:57,827
...to lose his only son and heir.

21
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:03,457
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

22
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:08,546
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

23
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:10,173
Leave me alone, snake!

24
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,259
Oh, but you are alone.

25
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:19,640
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

26
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,311
...in the bitter watches of the night...

27
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,148
...when all your life seems to shrink.

28
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:31,527
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

29
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:36,282
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

30
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,411
So fair.

31
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,039
So cold.

32
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:47,001
Like a morning of pale spring...

33
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,671
...still clinging to winter's chill.

34
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,896
Your words are poison.

35
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,949
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

36
00:04:56,297 --> 00:05:00,092
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

37
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:04,180
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.

38
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:23,282
Your staff.

39
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:30,164
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

40
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:51,853
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

41
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,737
He's a herald of woe.

42
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:06,325
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

43
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,870
...Théoden King.

44
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:12,081
He's not welcome.

45
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,379
Why should I welcome you...

46
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,550
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

47
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:26,012
A just question, my liege.

48
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:29,056
Late is the hour...

49
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:33,186
...in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

50
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,063
Láthspell I name him.

51
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,150
Ill news is an ill guest.

52
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:43,863
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

53
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,990
I have not passed
through fire and death...

54
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:49,285
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

55
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:52,413
His staff.

56
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:56,751
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

57
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,006
Théoden...

58
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,134
...son of Thengel...

59
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:09,305
...too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

60
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,520
I would stay still if I were you.

61
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,814
Hearken to me!

62
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,446
I release you...

63
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:27,615
...from the spell.

64
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,171
You have no power here...

65
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,967
...Gandalf the Grey.

66
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,477
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

67
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,446
Wait.

68
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:12,743
If I go, Théoden dies.

69
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,621
You did not kill me...

70
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,999
...you will not kill him.

71
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,629
Rohan is mine.

72
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:26,424
Be gone.

73
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,054
I know your face.

74
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,893
Éowyn.

75
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:22,480
Éowyn.

76
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:31,948
Gandalf?

77
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,326
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

78
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,300
Dark have been my dreams of late.

79
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,225
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

80
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:02,353
...if they grasped your sword.

81
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,400
I've only...

82
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:52,695
...ever served you, my lord.

83
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:57,867
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

84
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,828
Send me not from your sight.

85
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,833
No, my lord! No, my lord.

86
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,210
Let him go.

87
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,172
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

88
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:22,642
Get out of my way!

89
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:28,064
Hail, Théoden King!

90
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:55,133
Where is Théodred?

91
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,721
Where is my son?

92
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:29,644
Simbelmynë.

93
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:38,444
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

94
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:45,243
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

95
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:51,207
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

96
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,379
The young perish and the old linger.

97
00:13:56,963 --> 00:13:59,048
That I should live...

98
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:02,635
...to see the last days of my house.

99
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:07,723
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

100
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:14,188
No parent should have to bury
their child.

101
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,790
He was strong in life.

102
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,461
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

103
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:23,966
They had no warning.

104
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,552
They were unarmed.

105
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:31,015
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

106
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,935
Rick, cot and tree.

107
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,479
Where is Mama?

108
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:41,442
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

109
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:46,030
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

110
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:50,576
Ride out and meet him head on.

111
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:54,872
Draw him away from your women
and children.

112
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,833
You must fight.

113
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:00,837
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

114
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,630
Éomer is loyal to you.

115
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:05,508
His men will return
and fight for their king.

116
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:09,595
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

117
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:15,476
Éomer cannot help us.

118
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:17,895
I know what it is you want of me...

119
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:21,357
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

120
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,694
I will not risk open war.

121
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:30,283
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

122
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:36,164
When last I looked...

123
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:40,251
...Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

124
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,343
Then what is the king's decision?

125
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,309
<i>By order of the king...</i>

126
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:57,935
...the city must empty.

127
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:01,981
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

128
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:06,194
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

129
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,862
Helm's Deep.

130
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:11,574
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

131
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:13,701
Who will defend them if not their king?

132
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:16,329
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

133
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:18,289
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

134
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:22,376
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

135
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,754
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

136
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:27,089
What they will get is a massacre.

137
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:31,135
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

138
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:35,348
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

139
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:38,684
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

140
00:17:39,185 --> 00:17:41,979
The people of Rohan will need you.

141
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:44,816
The defenses have to hold.

142
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,985
They will hold.

143
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:54,242
The Grey Pilgrim.

144
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,078
That's what they used to call me.

145
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:02,333
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

146
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,170
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

147
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:10,007
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

148
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:13,594
At dawn, look to the east.

149
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,346
Go.

150
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:45,960
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

151
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:27,084
His name is Brego.

152
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:30,505
He was my cousin's horse.

153
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,548
Brego.

154
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,649
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

155
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:53,152
...but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

156
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:56,614
You speak as one of their own.

157
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,868
I was raised in Rivendell...

158
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,620
...for a time.

159
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:07,959
Turn this fellow free.

160
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:11,087
He's seen enough of war.

161
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,768
Gandalf the White.

162
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:28,312
Gandalf the Fool!

163
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:33,609
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

164
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:38,823
There were three
who followed the wizard.

165
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,579
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

166
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,707
You stink of horse.

167
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:54,839
The Man...

168
00:20:56,841 --> 00:21:01,053
...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

169
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,016
One of the Dúnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

170
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:07,018
His cloth was poor.

171
00:21:07,894 --> 00:21:13,024
And yet he bore a strange ring.

172
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,653
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

173
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:23,743
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

174
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,786
The Ring of Barahir.

175
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:30,333
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

176
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,878
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

177
00:21:34,003 --> 00:21:36,798
The line was broken years ago.

178
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:39,675
It matters not.

179
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:42,386
The world of Men shall fall.

180
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,430
It will begin at Edoras.

181
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,525
I am ready, Gamling.

182
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:58,152
Bring my horse.

183
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:02,698
This is not a defeat.

184
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:06,327
We will return.

185
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,168
We will return.

186
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,527
You have some skill with a blade.

187
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:50,079
Women of this country learned long ago:

188
00:22:50,246 --> 00:22:52,874
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

189
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,876
I fear neither death nor pain.

190
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:58,254
What do you fear, my lady?

191
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:03,509
A cage.

192
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,639
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

193
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:12,685
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

194
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:18,191
You're a daughter of kings...

195
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:22,737
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

196
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,536
I do not think that would be your fate.

197
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:06,614
<i>Théoden will not stay at Edoras.</i>

198
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:08,866
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

199
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,994
He will expect an attack on the city.

200
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:16,541
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

201
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:19,043
...the great fortress of Rohan.

202
00:24:20,253 --> 00:24:24,674
<i>It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.</i>

203
00:24:26,092 --> 00:24:27,802
<i>They will be slow.</i>

204
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:32,640
They will have women and children
with them.

205
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,771
Send out your Warg-riders.

206
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:56,539
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

207
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:59,375
- Why do you do that?
- What?

208
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:02,044
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

209
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:04,547
Because.

210
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,217
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

211
00:25:08,426 --> 00:25:10,595
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

212
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,806
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

213
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:16,267
You have no idea what it did to him...

214
00:25:16,434 --> 00:25:18,895
...what it's still doing to him.

215
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:23,232
I want to help him, Sam.

216
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:24,650
Why?

217
00:25:29,989 --> 00:25:33,117
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

218
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,248
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

219
00:25:39,457 --> 00:25:42,168
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

220
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:53,304
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

221
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:55,264
I do.

222
00:25:57,308 --> 00:25:59,185
It's the Ring.

223
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:01,312
You can't take your eyes off it.

224
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:04,023
I've seen you.

225
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,319
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

226
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:12,281
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

227
00:26:12,448 --> 00:26:15,159
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

228
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:18,287
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

229
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,164
Mine! My own!

230
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,126
Can't you hear yourself?

231
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:25,002
Don't you know who you sound like?

232
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:37,431
We wants it.

233
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,309
We needs it.

234
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:45,273
Must have the precious.

235
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:48,818
They stole it from us.

236
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:52,363
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

237
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:56,450
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

238
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:59,912
No. Not master.

239
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,916
Yes, precious. False.

240
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:08,546
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

241
00:27:09,714 --> 00:27:12,175
Master's my friend.

242
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:17,430
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

243
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:21,184
Not listening. I'm not listening.

244
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,354
You're a liar and a thief.

245
00:27:26,022 --> 00:27:27,523
No.

246
00:27:28,483 --> 00:27:31,360
Murderer.

247
00:27:33,863 --> 00:27:34,906
Go away.

248
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,408
Go away?

249
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,205
I hate you.

250
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:44,832
I hate you.

251
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:48,419
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

252
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:50,421
I saved us.

253
00:27:50,588 --> 00:27:55,092
It was me. We survived because of me.

254
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:59,889
Not anymore.

255
00:28:01,307 --> 00:28:02,809
What did you say?

256
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:08,773
Master looks after us now.

257
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,401
We don't need you.

258
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:14,695
What?

259
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:16,614
Leave now...

260
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:20,618
...and never come back.

261
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:21,786
No.

262
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:26,499
Leave now and never come back.

263
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:35,049
Leave now and never come back!

264
00:28:46,978 --> 00:28:49,647
We told him to go away.

265
00:28:49,814 --> 00:28:52,817
And away he goes, precious.

266
00:28:52,984 --> 00:28:54,986
Gone! Gone! Gone!

267
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:56,988
Sméagol is free!

268
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:03,327
Look.

269
00:29:03,536 --> 00:29:07,999
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

270
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:18,968
They are young.

271
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:21,679
They are tender. They are nice.

272
00:29:21,846 --> 00:29:25,391
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

273
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:29,687
You'll make him sick, you will...

274
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:33,107
...behaving like that.

275
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:38,279
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

276
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,076
What's it doing?

277
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:47,371
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

278
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,749
It ruins it.

279
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:53,586
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

280
00:29:57,715 --> 00:30:00,259
What we need is a few good taters.

281
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:04,222
What's taters, precious?

282
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:06,098
What's taters? Eh?

283
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:08,017
Po-ta-toes.

284
00:30:08,351 --> 00:30:11,562
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

285
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:18,569
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

286
00:30:19,946 --> 00:30:21,823
Even you couldn't say no to that.

287
00:30:22,198 --> 00:30:24,325
Oh, yes, we could.

288
00:30:24,534 --> 00:30:28,037
Spoil a nice fish.

289
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:31,958
Give it to us raw...

290
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:35,128
...and wriggling.

291
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:38,422
You keep nasty chips.

292
00:30:39,382 --> 00:30:41,425
You're hopeless.

293
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:55,439
Mr. Frodo?

294
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,960
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

295
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:18,671
Servants of Sauron.

296
00:31:19,464 --> 00:31:21,632
They are called to Mordor.

297
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,802
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

298
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:28,181
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

299
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:33,436
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

300
00:31:33,603 --> 00:31:38,774
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

301
00:31:39,025 --> 00:31:42,111
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

302
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:43,488
Mr. Frodo.

303
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,615
Look.

304
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:51,496
It's an oliphaunt.

305
00:31:59,754 --> 00:32:02,757
No one at home will believe this.

306
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:15,770
Sméagol?

307
00:32:56,144 --> 00:32:58,604
We've lingered here too long.

308
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:02,942
Come on, Sam.

309
00:33:16,414 --> 00:33:19,125
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

310
00:33:20,877 --> 00:33:25,923
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

311
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,010
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

312
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:33,764
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

313
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:35,975
The enemy?

314
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:41,564
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

315
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:46,110
You wonder what his name is...

316
00:33:47,612 --> 00:33:49,864
...where he came from.

317
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:54,243
And if he was really evil at heart.

318
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:59,415
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

319
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,503
If he would not rather have stayed there...

320
00:34:05,755 --> 00:34:07,215
...in peace.

321
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,805
War will make corpses of us all.

322
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:16,057
Bind their hands.

323
00:34:28,564 --> 00:34:31,233
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

324
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:35,112
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

325
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:38,448
...that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

326
00:34:38,824 --> 00:34:40,742
It's the beards.

327
00:34:40,951 --> 00:34:43,078
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

328
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:46,123
...that there are no Dwarf women...

329
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:50,544
...and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

330
00:34:52,254 --> 00:34:54,131
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

331
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,472
It's all right. Nobody panic.

332
00:35:02,973 --> 00:35:04,975
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

333
00:35:06,935 --> 00:35:10,731
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

334
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:13,775
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

335
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:16,236
Cut down by Orcs.

336
00:35:16,403 --> 00:35:19,406
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

337
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:24,620
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

338
00:35:24,786 --> 00:35:29,374
Doomed to wait upon an old man
who should have loved her as a father.

339
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:41,762
Gimli.

340
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:43,972
No, I couldn't

341
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:46,016
I really couldn't.

342
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,105
I made some stew.

343
00:35:52,272 --> 00:35:55,567
It isn't much, but it's hot.

344
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:05,452
Thank you.

345
00:36:25,931 --> 00:36:28,433
- It's good.
- Really?

346
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:35,816
My uncle told me a strange thing.

347
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:41,154
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

348
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:44,074
But he must be mistaken.

349
00:36:44,366 --> 00:36:48,745
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

350
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:53,083
Then you must be at least 60.

351
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,753
Seventy?

352
00:36:57,212 --> 00:36:58,839
But you cannot be 80!

353
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:03,552
Eighty-seven.

354
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,765
You are one of the Dúnedain.

355
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,936
A descendant of Númenor,
blessed with long life.

356
00:37:14,146 --> 00:37:16,815
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

357
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:19,234
There are few of us left.

358
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:22,195
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

359
00:37:22,946 --> 00:37:26,366
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

360
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:45,135
<i>The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.</i>

361
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:49,348
<i>It is mine to give to whom I will.</i>

362
00:37:51,183 --> 00:37:53,602
<i>Like my heart.</i>

363
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,773
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

364
00:37:57,898 --> 00:38:00,400
I am asleep.

365
00:38:06,865 --> 00:38:08,825
This is a dream.

366
00:38:11,078 --> 00:38:14,289
Then it is a good dream.

367
00:38:26,218 --> 00:38:28,345
Sleep.

368
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:33,201
Arwen...

369
00:40:22,668 --> 00:40:24,461
Where is she?

370
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:28,131
The woman who gave you that jewel.

371
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:34,137
<i>Our time here is ending.</i>

372
00:40:34,888 --> 00:40:37,391
Arwen's time is ending.

373
00:40:38,183 --> 00:40:39,434
Let her go.

374
00:40:39,601 --> 00:40:41,603
Let her take the ship into the west.

375
00:40:41,812 --> 00:40:44,856
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

376
00:40:45,023 --> 00:40:46,817
There it will be ever green.

377
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,696
But never more than memory.

378
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:55,033
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

379
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,829
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

380
00:40:58,996 --> 00:41:01,331
She belongs with her people.

381
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,423
Why are you saying this?

382
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,178
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

383
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:00,307
It was a dream, Arwen.

384
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,100
Nothing more.

385
00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:06,730
I don't believe you.

386
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:17,574
This belongs to you.

387
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:21,912
It was a gift.

388
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:26,041
Keep it.

389
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:29,753
My lord?

390
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:37,135
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

391
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:02,077
What is it?

392
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:05,622
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.

393
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:24,182
Wargs!

394
00:43:36,737 --> 00:43:38,447
A scout!

395
00:43:44,745 --> 00:43:47,289
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

396
00:43:48,624 --> 00:43:50,834
Get them out of here!

397
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:57,591
All riders to the head of the column.

398
00:43:58,342 --> 00:44:00,302
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

399
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,221
Come on!

400
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:16,485
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

401
00:44:16,693 --> 00:44:18,153
- I can fight.
- No!

402
00:44:20,864 --> 00:44:22,908
You must do this, for me.

403
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:26,536
Follow me!

404
00:44:30,082 --> 00:44:34,378
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

405
00:44:34,586 --> 00:44:37,256
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

406
00:45:49,494 --> 00:45:51,747
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

407
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:56,126
That one counts as mine!

408
00:46:12,851 --> 00:46:14,478
Stinking creature.

409
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,567
Aragorn!

410
00:47:48,322 --> 00:47:49,740
Aragorn?

411
00:48:03,754 --> 00:48:06,673
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

412
00:48:06,882 --> 00:48:08,258
He's...

413
00:48:08,884 --> 00:48:10,427
...dead.

414
00:48:11,136 --> 00:48:14,014
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

415
00:48:17,601 --> 00:48:18,936
You lie.

416
00:48:52,803 --> 00:48:54,388
Get the wounded on horses.

417
00:48:55,764 --> 00:48:58,892
The wolves of Isengard will return.

418
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:01,395
Leave the dead.

419
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:10,362
Come.

420
00:49:20,497 --> 00:49:22,082
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

421
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:25,168
There it is, Helm's Deep.

422
00:49:27,713 --> 00:49:29,506
We're safe!

423
00:49:31,049 --> 00:49:33,927
We're safe, my lady.

424
00:49:34,094 --> 00:49:35,262
Thank you.

425
00:50:19,681 --> 00:50:21,058
- Mama!
- Éothain!

426
00:50:21,225 --> 00:50:22,726
Freda!

427
00:50:28,482 --> 00:50:31,318
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

428
00:50:35,155 --> 00:50:36,490
Take it to the caves.

429
00:50:36,657 --> 00:50:39,534
Make way for the king.

430
00:50:40,535 --> 00:50:44,373
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

431
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:56,009
So few. So few of you have returned.

432
00:50:58,762 --> 00:51:01,056
Our people are safe.

433
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:04,935
We have paid for it with many lives.

434
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:07,312
My lady.

435
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:13,318
Lord Aragorn...

436
00:51:13,485 --> 00:51:14,736
...where is he?

437
00:51:16,697 --> 00:51:18,240
He fell.

438
00:51:40,929 --> 00:51:43,891
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

439
00:51:44,016 --> 00:51:46,977
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

440
00:51:47,185 --> 00:51:50,314
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

441
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,066
Get them into the caves.

442
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:58,822
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

443
00:52:00,866 --> 00:52:04,286
<i>Helm 's Deep has one weakness.</i>

444
00:52:04,453 --> 00:52:06,747
<i>Its outer wall is solid rock...</i>

445
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:10,042
<i>... but for a small culvert
at its base...</i>

446
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:12,961
<i>... which is little more than a drain.</i>

447
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:20,010
How? How can fire undo stone?

448
00:52:20,177 --> 00:52:24,681
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

449
00:52:28,268 --> 00:52:32,272
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

450
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:35,984
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

451
00:52:36,151 --> 00:52:38,695
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

452
00:52:38,904 --> 00:52:40,322
Tens of thousands.

453
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:44,576
But, my lord, there is no such force.

454
00:52:56,505 --> 00:52:59,591
A new power is rising.

455
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,803
Its victory is at hand.

456
00:53:08,475 --> 00:53:10,519
This night...

457
00:53:10,936 --> 00:53:15,315
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

458
00:53:15,482 --> 00:53:18,777
March to Helm's Deep!

459
00:53:18,944 --> 00:53:22,406
Leave none alive!

460
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:27,411
To war!

461
00:53:31,373 --> 00:53:35,794
There will be no dawn for Men.

462
00:53:52,978 --> 00:53:55,063
Look. There's smoke to the south.

463
00:53:55,272 --> 00:53:58,400
There is always smoke rising...

464
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:02,487
...from Isengard these days.

465
00:54:02,696 --> 00:54:04,323
Isengard?

466
00:54:04,531 --> 00:54:06,408
There was a time...

467
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,245
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

468
00:54:10,454 --> 00:54:13,790
But now he has a mind of metal...

469
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:16,877
...and wheels.

470
00:54:17,669 --> 00:54:22,174
He no longer cares for growing things.

471
00:54:22,299 --> 00:54:24,134
What is it?

472
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:31,350
It's Saruman's army.

473
00:54:31,558 --> 00:54:33,060
The war has started.

474
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:15,852
<i>May the grace of the Valar
protect you.</i>

475
00:55:48,093 --> 00:55:49,970
Brego.

476
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,289
Arwen.

477
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,842
I have made my choice.

478
00:56:35,307 --> 00:56:38,143
He is not coming back.

479
00:56:39,603 --> 00:56:42,940
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

480
00:56:43,857 --> 00:56:46,818
There is still hope.

481
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:54,785
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

482
00:56:58,205 --> 00:57:01,166
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

483
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:03,835
...and all that you hope for
comes true...

484
00:57:04,002 --> 00:57:08,674
...you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

485
00:57:08,966 --> 00:57:11,969
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

486
00:57:12,135 --> 00:57:15,097
...Aragorn will die.

487
00:57:17,975 --> 00:57:20,477
<i>And there will be no comfort
for you...</i>

488
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:24,856
<i>... no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.</i>

489
00:57:27,651 --> 00:57:30,404
<i>He will come to death...</i>

490
00:57:30,571 --> 00:57:33,156
<i>... an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...</i>

491
00:57:33,323 --> 00:57:37,995
<i>... in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.</i>

492
00:57:47,129 --> 00:57:51,049
<i>But you, my daughter...</i>

493
00:57:51,884 --> 00:57:56,930
<i>... you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...</i>

494
00:57:57,055 --> 00:58:01,143
<i>... as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.</i>

495
00:58:03,562 --> 00:58:05,939
<i>Here you will dwell...</i>

496
00:58:06,106 --> 00:58:11,028
<i>... bound to your grief
under the fading trees...</i>

497
00:58:12,738 --> 00:58:14,740
<i>... until all the world is changed...</i>

498
00:58:14,907 --> 00:58:19,453
...and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

499
00:58:27,961 --> 00:58:29,129
Arwen.

500
00:58:35,761 --> 00:58:38,055
There is nothing for you here...

501
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,807
...only death.

502
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:17,863
<i>The power of the enemy is growing.</i>

503
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:20,657
<i>Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...</i>

504
01:00:20,866 --> 01:00:24,244
<i>... to destroy the people of Rohan.</i>

505
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:29,917
<i>Isengard has been unleashed.</i>

506
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:37,633
<i>The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...</i>

507
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,762
<i>... the last free kingdom of Men.</i>

508
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:46,350
<i>His war on this country
will come swiftly.</i>

509
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:53,148
<i>He senses the Ring is close.</i>

510
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:56,777
<i>The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.</i>

511
01:00:56,944 --> 01:01:01,031
<i>In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...</i>

512
01:01:02,574 --> 01:01:06,453
...the quest will claim his life.

513
01:01:06,578 --> 01:01:08,747
You know this.

514
01:01:09,414 --> 01:01:12,251
<i>You have foreseen it.</i>

515
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:17,798
<i>It is the risk we all took.</i>

516
01:01:22,135 --> 01:01:26,306
<i>In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.</i>

517
01:01:27,474 --> 01:01:31,937
<i>It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.</i>

518
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:37,568
<i>Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.</i>

519
01:01:37,776 --> 01:01:41,321
<i>The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...</i>

520
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:45,576
<i>... take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.</i>

521
01:01:48,036 --> 01:01:49,871
<i>It is close now.</i>

522
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:54,334
<i>So close to achieving its goal.</i>

523
01:01:57,421 --> 01:02:01,049
<i>For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...</i>

524
01:02:01,216 --> 01:02:05,345
<i>... even unto to the ending
of the world.</i>

525
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,016
<i>The time of the Elves...</i>

526
01:02:09,224 --> 01:02:11,143
<i>... is over.</i>

527
01:02:11,977 --> 01:02:15,606
<i>Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?</i>

528
01:02:17,566 --> 01:02:20,819
<i>Do we let them stand alone?</i>

529
01:02:25,407 --> 01:02:26,742
What news?

530
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,703
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

531
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:32,748
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

532
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:36,960
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

533
01:02:37,127 --> 01:02:39,504
Sauron is marshaling an army.

534
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,007
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

535
01:02:42,174 --> 01:02:45,552
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

536
01:02:46,678 --> 01:02:50,224
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

537
01:02:50,432 --> 01:02:53,477
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

538
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:57,814
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

539
01:02:57,981 --> 01:03:00,692
Sauron from Mordor.

540
01:03:01,985 --> 01:03:05,239
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

541
01:03:05,405 --> 01:03:07,074
Gondor is weak.

542
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:10,410
Sauron will strike us soon.

543
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,996
And he will strike hard.

544
01:03:13,455 --> 01:03:17,501
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

545
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,642
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

546
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:36,562
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

547
01:03:36,728 --> 01:03:38,981
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

548
01:03:45,862 --> 01:03:47,614
Speak.

549
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:51,285
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

550
01:03:51,618 --> 01:03:54,663
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

551
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,582
Your bodyguard?

552
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:58,542
His gardener.

553
01:03:59,209 --> 01:04:01,211
And where is your skulking friend?

554
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:05,007
That gangrel creature.

555
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,301
He had an ill-favored look.

556
01:04:09,052 --> 01:04:10,971
There was no other.

557
01:04:15,058 --> 01:04:17,394
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

558
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:23,775
One we lost in Moria...

559
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,403
...two were my kin...

560
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:30,324
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

561
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:34,411
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

562
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:41,209
You're a friend of Boromir?

563
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:45,130
Yes.

564
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,257
For my part.

565
01:04:53,805 --> 01:04:56,725
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

566
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,229
Dead?

567
01:05:00,437 --> 01:05:02,481
How? When?

568
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:05,359
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

569
01:05:05,734 --> 01:05:09,571
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

570
01:05:12,282 --> 01:05:18,747
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

571
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:22,042
It was cloven in two.

572
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:27,089
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

573
01:05:29,132 --> 01:05:30,926
He was my brother.

574
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:22,853
Boromir!

575
01:06:23,353 --> 01:06:25,230
Boromir!

576
01:06:29,484 --> 01:06:33,238
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

577
01:06:33,405 --> 01:06:37,075
A place of light and beauty and music.

578
01:06:37,242 --> 01:06:39,536
And so it shall be once more!

579
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,750
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

580
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,338
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

581
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:58,847
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

582
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,141
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

583
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:04,144
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

584
01:07:12,861 --> 01:07:15,656
Good speech. Nice and short.

585
01:07:15,822 --> 01:07:18,742
Leaves more time for drinking!

586
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:23,247
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

587
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,835
Remember today, little brother.

588
01:07:29,044 --> 01:07:32,005
Today, life is good.

589
01:07:36,176 --> 01:07:37,803
What?

590
01:07:38,136 --> 01:07:39,638
He's here.

591
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:44,685
One moment of peace,
can he not give us that?

592
01:07:44,851 --> 01:07:45,894
Where is he?

593
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:49,481
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

594
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:51,775
Father!

595
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:58,991
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

596
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:02,578
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

597
01:08:04,037 --> 01:08:06,957
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

598
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:10,085
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

599
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,254
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

600
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,131
Oh, too few.

601
01:08:14,631 --> 01:08:17,050
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

602
01:08:19,219 --> 01:08:22,222
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

603
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,683
That is not my intent.

604
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:28,645
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

605
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:34,902
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

606
01:08:35,068 --> 01:08:37,821
... I know his uses, and they are few.

607
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,617
We have more urgent things to speak of.

608
01:08:42,784 --> 01:08:45,245
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

609
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:48,290
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

610
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:52,252
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

611
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,757
The One Ring.

612
01:08:59,509 --> 01:09:04,139
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

613
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:07,976
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

614
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:12,272
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

615
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:16,777
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

616
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:20,656
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

617
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:24,701
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

618
01:09:24,868 --> 01:09:30,165
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

619
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:35,379
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

620
01:09:35,587 --> 01:09:37,089
He will return.

621
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:41,009
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

622
01:09:41,176 --> 01:09:43,762
You must go.

623
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,015
Bring me back this mighty gift.

624
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:53,355
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

625
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:57,234
- Would you deny your own father?
- Lf there is need to go to Rivendell...

626
01:09:57,401 --> 01:10:00,362
...send me in his stead.
- You?

627
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,532
Oh, I see.

628
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:07,869
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

629
01:10:08,328 --> 01:10:10,289
I think not.

630
01:10:10,455 --> 01:10:13,375
I trust this mission only to your brother.

631
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,420
The one who will not fail me.

632
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,690
Remember today, little brother.

633
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:57,044
Captain Faramir!

634
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:00,464
We found the third one.

635
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:13,936
You must come with me. Now.

636
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:26,240
Down there.

637
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:44,091
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

638
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,144
They wait for my command.

639
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:02,776
Shall I shoot?

640
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:07,030
<i>The rock and pool
Is nice and cool</i>

641
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:09,032
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

642
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:12,619
<i>Our only wish
To catch a fish</i>

643
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:15,497
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

644
01:12:22,462 --> 01:12:23,881
Wait.

645
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:28,176
This creature is bound to me.

646
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,762
And I to him.

647
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:35,309
He is our guide.

648
01:12:40,063 --> 01:12:41,481
Please...

649
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:43,525
...let me go down to him.

650
01:12:54,786 --> 01:12:56,496
Sméagol.

651
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,708
Master is here.

652
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,044
Come, Sméagol.

653
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,549
Trust master. Come.

654
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,556
We must go now?

655
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:18,352
Sméagol, you must trust master.

656
01:13:18,518 --> 01:13:19,937
Follow me. Come on.

657
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:22,689
Come.

658
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:26,360
Come, Sméagol.

659
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,904
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

660
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:30,948
Come on.

661
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:37,079
Don't hurt him!

662
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,998
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

663
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:41,416
Master!

664
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,027
That's enough.

665
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:14,825
Where are you leading them?

666
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,328
Answer me.

667
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:22,374
Sméagol.
