Huh?

dance, I wouldn't be doin' this, you know?

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,952
And this turtle food I got here, it's uh...

68
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,949
This turtle food, gotta add more flies in.
There are more moths in it.

69

More flies... More moths...
Who the hell cares?

The last turtle food I got here
had more moths in it than flies.

77

The moths get caught
in the turtles' throats.

78
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,398
They cough and I smack 'em on the back
of the shell. What do you think they get?

79
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,080
And they get what, huh?

They get shell-shocked.

81

- Inventin' jokes ain't so easy sometimes.

I'm broke!

97

Mr Gazzo says I should get the 200
or break your thumb.

You wanna dance,
you gotta pay the band.

101

You wanna borrow,
you gotta pay the man.

102
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,070
Hey, I ain't emotionally involved, Bob,
you understand? Gimme some money.

103
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,475
Gimme some money. Come on.

104
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,030
- There's 130 here.
- That's it. I'm broke.

Hey, Bob. Hey, hey.

You're still $70 light.

107
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,075
You don't have to break nothin'. Here,
take my coat. It's worth 50, 60 dollars.

108

Here, take the coat. Take the coat!

109

Gazzo won't be wise to nothin'!

He won't...

114

He only had 130, but I think he's
good for the rest next week, Mr Gazzo.

115
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,715
Sure, Rocky. Bob's good for it.

- Hey, did you get the licence number?
- Of what?

121
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,999
- The truck that run over your face.
- Relax, buddy. Pull it over here.

122
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,032
I wanna let Rocky out,
then I'm gonna talk to him.

123
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,196
How come you didn't break his thumb?

124
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,515
- How do you know I didn't?
- I hear things.

125
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,949
- Did I give you a job this mornin'?
- Yeah.

126
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,116
So why didn't you break his thumb?

127
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,915
When you don't do what I tell you to do,
you make me look bad, Rock.

128
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,670
I figured... Look, if I break the guy's
thumb, he gets laid off, right? He can't...

129
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,351
Well, let me do the figurin', OK, Rock?
From here on, just let me do the figurin'.

130
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,359
These guys think we're runnin'
a charity and they're gonna get off light.

131
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,835
From here on in,
do what I tell you to do...

132
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,317
...because it's bad for my reputation,
you understand? You got it, Rock?

133
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,196
I got it.

134

Hey, how do you spell Del Rio?

135
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,749
- Look in a dictionary, Rock!
- Come on!

136
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,509
Hey, I won't let that happen no more -
about the thumb.

137
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,035
You know?

138
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,390

141
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,268

No, I'm short.

144
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,712
Hey, yo, Mike. Where's my lock?
Whose stuff is this in my locker?

145
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,877
It's Dipper's stuff.
It ain't your locker no more.

146
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,518
What you talkin' about? It's been my
locker for six years. Where's my gear?

147
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,393
Mickey told me to bag it and hang it.

148
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,595
You put my stuff on skid row?

149
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,395
I been in that locker for six years
and you put my stuff on skid row?

150
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,954
Mickey tells me what to do, I gotta do it.

151
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,993
- Where is he?
- He's outside, working with Dipper.

152
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,680
- He's in a bad mood.
- So am I.

153
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,637
Put your hands up there. That's right.
Keep your hands up. That's right.

154
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,274
- Hey, Mick.
- Shut up!

155
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,356
<i>(trainer) Attaboy!</i>

156
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,196
Time! Time!

157
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,151
- What the hell...? What do you want?
- How you feelin' today?

158
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,989
- What are you, a doctor or somethin'?
- You got problems today?

159
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,908
- Never mind my problem. What's yours?
- I've been talkin' to Michael.

160
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,749
- How come I been put outta my locker?
- Because Dipper needed it.

161
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,758
Dipper's a contender, a climber.
Know what you are?

162
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,632
- What?
- A tomato.

163
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,673
Yeah, let's face it. I run a business here,
not a goddamn soup kitchen.

164
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,597
- Did you fight last night?
- Yeah.

165
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,632
- Did you win?
- Yeah, I won KO in the second.

166
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,320
- Yeah? Who'd you fight?
- Spider Rico.

167
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,034
<i>(laughs) He's a bum!</i>

168
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,470
- You think everybody I fight is a bum.
- Well, ain't they?

169
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,116
You got heart, but you fight like a
goddamn ape. Nothin' special about you.

170
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,075
You never got your nose busted. Leave it
that way, and what's left of your mind.

171
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,919
Mick, I think I'll go take a steam.
You know why?

172
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,679
I did real good last night.
You shoulda seen me.

173
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,189
- Big deal.
- You shoulda seen me too.

174
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,471
Hey, kid, you ever think about retiring?

175
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,034
- No.
- You think about it.

176
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,390
<i>- All right. Time!
- (Dipper) Hey, hey!</i>

177
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,080
- What?
- I dig your locker, man.

178
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,108
Cold night.

179
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,198
Good night to catch pneumonia,
you know?

180
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,999
You need some help with that cage?

181
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,271
There's a good game
down at the Spectrum tonight.

182
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
You wanna go to a basketball game?

183

<i>- (dog barks)
- Hi, Butkus. Hi, kid.</i>

184
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,629
Tough day today.
They took my locker away.

185
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,558
I had that locker for six years,
but it don't bother me.

186
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,399
Lockers are bad.
People get the combination.

187
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,149
I must've had 20 bucks taken
outta there in the past six years.

188
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,430
It don't sound like much, but it adds up.

189
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,154
You know? It doesn't matter. Who cares?

190
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,671
Cold night... Hey, birds!
Hey, look who's here!

191
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,360
Look who's here. The giant worm.

192
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,558
Look at these birds. Don't these birds
look like candy? Like flyin' candy.

193
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,511
Want to fly me home?

194
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,313
Do you need somebody
to walk you home, you know?

195
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,873
No.

196
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,709
It's a cold night. If I was you and
you got the money, I would take a cab.

197
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,354
Too many creeps around here, you know?

198
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,837
Every other block there's a creep.
You can always tell a creep.

199
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,829
All right, listen. I'm gonna go now.
I'll see ya's later, all right?

200
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,555
Now you guys get up.
I know you had a hard day in the cage.

201
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,435
So... I wanna go home, make up a joke.
I'll tell you a new joke tomorrow, OK?

202
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,313
- Good night, Adrian.
- Good night, Rocky.

203
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,116
Yo!

204
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,278
There you go. I got a friend for you here.

205
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,472
- Hello, Rock.
- How you doin'? You seen Paulie?

206
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,477
He's in the steam room.

207
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,353
- Hey, Rocky, what's with the eye?
- Been fightin'.

208
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,837
- Hope ya's won it, at least.
- I did real good. You shoulda seen me.

209
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,994
- Hey, Rock, who'd you fight?
- Spider Rico.

210
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,157
- Hey, is he still around?
- Yeah, he's doin' real good.

211
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,832
He's doin' better than you are, that's
for sure! Hey, Paulie, you lock the door?

212
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,633
I'd like to kill the moron
who broke the mirror.

213
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,830
Hey, yo, Paulie!

214
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,078
Every day, every night I pass by.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.

215
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,670
- Forget her. You could do better than her.
- I don't forget nothin'.

216
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,430
Every night, I pass by the place, I tell
a joke. Every mornin', I tell a joke. Nothin'.

217
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,551
She just looks at me, you know?

218
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,592
- Looks, huh?
- Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers.

219
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,077
I need a Cadillac to connect with your
sister? Somethin' wrong with my face?

220
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,670
She's a freakin' loser.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy...

221
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,997
...I could split her head with a razor.
- Don't get mental, man.

222
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,554
- You caught me in a bad mood.
- You always are.

223
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,877
- Adrian ain't sharp. Adrian is a loser.
- Hey!

224
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,391
She's pushin' 30 years old and if she
don't watch out she'll end up dyin' alone.

225

Come on, let's get outta this stink,
would ya? Come on.

228
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,394
- I wanna talk to you, anyway.
- About what?

229
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,829
- Do you still work for Gazzo?
- Yeah, sure.

230
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,599
Why don't you talk to him about me?

231
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,271
Well, I just don't think
Gazzo's hirin' right now, you know?

232
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,356
Come on.

- The girl's dryin' up.
- Who?

234
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,516
My sister. If she don't start livin',
her body's gonna dry up.

235
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,428
You know, tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Come over and talk to her.

236
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,996
- Sure. Beer!
- Tomorrow you come for some bird.

237
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,873
Absolutely. You got it.

238
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,594
I gotta go. If I'm late,
she calls the hospital.

Hey, you know, when I was your age...

269
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,440
...there was one girl in the neighbourhood
who talked like that, you know? Just one.

270

What you doin'?
That'll make your teeth yellow.

271

- And your breath like garbage.

272

- Maybe I like garbage.
- C'mon, nobody likes garbage.

Anyway, this girl wasn't bad-looking...

...but guys never took her serious,
you see?

- They never took her out for a date.
- Why?

276

Guys laugh when you talk dirty.
They think you're cute.

277

If you get a reputation,
you get no respect, you understand?

278
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,676
You get no respect.
I gotta use a bad word.

279
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,075
Whore. You understand? Whore.

280

You see, if you use dirty words,
you maybe end up becomin' a whore.

No, you ain't got a boyfriend.
You know why?

290

Why don't you? Because you hang out
with them coconuts on the corner.

291

You hang around with coconuts,
you get nowhere. They're lemons!

Hang out with nice people,
you get nice friends.

293

Hang out with smart people,
you get smart friends.

294
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,438
Hang out with yo-yo people,
you get yo-yo friends.

295
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,996
It's simple mathematics.
I hope you ain't gonna...

296
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,678
- I won't.
- What was I gonna say?

297
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,837
You hope I stop actin'
like a whore or I'll turn into one.

298
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,110
- Somethin' like that.
- Night, Rocky.

299
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,470
- Night, Marie. Take care.
- Hey, Rocky.

300
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,989
- Yo?
- Screw you, creepo!

301
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,354
Yeah, who are you to give advice, creepo?
Who are you?

302
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,957
- Are the doctor's reports confirmed?
- Definitely.

303
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,757
It says that Green has suffered a severely
cracked third metacarpal in his left hand.

304
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,074
We can cancel the fight indefinitely
if you're set on fighting Green.

305
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,478
Hey, it ain't just Green! What about
all the time Apollo has invested?

306
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,398
- I believe we can find a solution.
- Solution nothin'.

307
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,114
Find me another contender in a flash,
Jergens.

308
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,677
Don't play games with my client. He's
done a million dollars' worth of publicity...

309
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,519
...and has made contractual obligations.

310
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,599
- He's not going to be embarrassed!
- I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.

311
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,633
- Ernie is fighting in France that week.
- Buddy Shaw. He's ranked fifth.

312
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,788
Went to California and gained 50 pounds.
I got hold of every worthwhile contender...

313
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,674
...and they all say five weeks
isn't enough time to get into shape.

314
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,157
Shape nothin', man! They afraid! They
know everybody's gonna see the fight.

315
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,874
None of 'em can whip me.
They're makin' excuses...

316
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,072
...so they don't get whipped
in front of the whole world.

317
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,033
All I can say is I'm a good promoter.

318
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,391
I've promoted fights
in every goddamn country in the world...

319
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,275
...and I've broken my ass over this,
but I don't know what the hell else to do.

320
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,877
I do.

321
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,472
Without a ranked contender,
what this fight is gonna need is a novelty.

322
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,875
This is the land of opportunity, right?

323
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,870
So Apollo Creed on January 1 gives
a local underdog fighter an opportunity.

324
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,152
A snow-white underdog. And I'm gonna
put his face on this poster with me.

325
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,872
And I'll tell you why.

326
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,676
Because I'm sentimental,
like a lot of other people in this country.

327
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,998
There's nothing they'd like better than
to see Apollo Creed give a local boy...

328
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,908
...a shot at the world title
on this country's biggest birthday.

329
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,429
<i>Now that's the way I see it.</i>

330
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,596
And that's the way it's gonna be.

331
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,711
Apollo, I like it!

332
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,149
It's very American.

333
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,033
No, Jergens. It's very smart.

334
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,555
<i>(Jergens laughs)</i>

335
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,949
- What is it?
- I just wanna check this out.

336
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,356
I pick up two yards from Snyder
and a grand from Cappoli?

337
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,314
No, no. Two yards from Cappoli
and a grand from Snyder.

338
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,671
- Two yards. Yeah, I got it.
- OK, write it down, OK?

339
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,270
Who's this girl you're
goin' out with tomorrow night?

340
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,358
- How d'you know?
- Don't you think I hear things?

341
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,951
- A lot of canaries flyin' around the docks.
- I'm goin' out with Paulie's sister.

342
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,709
- I hear she's retarded.
- She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?

343
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,356
I'll tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo.
I hear retards like the zoo.

344
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,835
- This bum gotta say that?
- You callin' me a bum?

345
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,111
<i>- I'm callin' you a bum!
- OK, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.</i>

346
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,595
- It's his prostate.
- He's always in a bad mood.

347
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,996
Count your blessings, Buddy.
You're still healthy.

348
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,350
- I don't like your face.
- I don't like yours!

349
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,277
- Kiss my ass!
- Move!

350
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,349
Relax! Relax! Relax! My ears! What,
are you drivin' me crazy? Both of ya's.

351
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,397
Buddy doesn't like ya. Some guys,
they just hate for no reason, you got me?

352
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,476
- Yeah.
- Come here.

353
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,512
There's 50 bucks.
You and Adrian, you have a nice time.

354
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,756
Thanks.

355
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,239
- Hey, how'd you know her name?
- You don't think I hear things?

356
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,718
<i>- (Buddy) Remember what I told you.
- What'd you tell me?</i>

357
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,990
Take her to the zoo!

358
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,594
- Some more coffee, Mr Creed?
- No thanks, Shirley.

359
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,678
- What do you think about Billy Snow?
- Fouls.

360
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,796
- How about Big Chuck Smith?
- Yeah.

361
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,629
No, he's too old and dull.
Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.

362
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,675
- No, I don't feel the heat from that name.
- Joe Zack's a good prospect.

363
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,076
<i>Exactly what are you lookin' for, Apollo?</i>

364
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,599
This is what I'm lookin' for.
The Italian Stallion.

365
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,835
Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.

366
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,190
Look, it's the name, man.

367
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,959
The Italian Stallion.

368
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,631
The media'll eat it up. Now who
discovered America? An Italian, right?

369
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,070
What would be better than
to get it on with a descendant?

370
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,272
He's a southpaw.
I don't want you messin' with them.

371
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,155
- They do everything backwards.
- Southpaw nothin'! I'll drop him in three.

372
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,273
"Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion."

373
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,671
Sounds like a damn monster movie!

374
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,475
What are you doin' with that bat?
I used to be deadly at stickball.

375
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,754
- You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?
- Very excited. Look at my swollen hands.

376
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,077
The joints, from carrying meat
in and out of freezers.

377
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,272
- Plays hell on the joints.
- Maybe you oughta see a doctor.

378
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,868
I don't need a doctor.
I need a different job.

379
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,151
- What kind of turkey? Big or small?
- Talk to Gazzo about me.

380
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,670
Tell him I'm a good man
and nothin' bothers me.

381
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,349
I'd make a great collector.
Bustin' bones don't bother me.

382
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,190
A big turkey, right? Hey, forget Gazzo.
That's a bad job, you know what I mean?

383
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,676
- You got a match?
- Go to him for me, as a favour.

384
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,519
Yeah, yeah. Last time I had a turkey...

385
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:07,237
...it was when they had a $2 special
at Horn & Hardart's about three years ago.

386
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,234
- Your sister knows I'm comin', for sure?
- Yeah, she's gonna be excited.

387
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,153
Hey, will you forget about Gazzo, huh?

388
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,511
- I don't ask nobody twice.
- You don't ask nobody twice.

389
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,393
# Stay away, baby

390
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,797
- You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very excited.

391
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,914
<i>(Adrian) Paulie! You're late.</i>

392
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,989
You called the hospital? She calls
the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.

393
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,270
<i>(Rocky) Yo, how you doin'?</i>

394
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,755
I told you she's very excited.

395
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,715
Why didn't you say
you were bringin' him?

396
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,276
- Look at me. I'm not ready.
- Would it make a difference if you were?

397
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,075
- He's a friend and he's takin' you out.
- No, I can't.

398
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,749
I want you outta the kitchen
and I want you out right now.

399
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,235
I won't.

400
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,033
Hey! Hey!

401
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,069
Hey, I want you outta here instamatically!

402
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,876
I'm sick of seein' you hangin' around
like a spider! Go out and live! Enjoy life!

403
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,436
- Paulie, I can't go!
- Don't get wise with me now.

404
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,269
- I'm tired of you bein' a loser.
- Don't call me that, Paulie!

Bicentennial championship fight...</i>

Why?

410
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,788
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
I got a turkey in the oven.

411
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,753
Oh. A turkey in the oven?

412
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,836
Oh.

413
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,591
You want the bird?

414
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,836
Go in the alley and eat the bird!

415
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,190
Oh, Paulie!

416
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,118
I want you outta here!
Get outta the house!

417
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,635
Go out and enjoy your freakin' life!

You hungry, Rock?

419
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,435
Hey, yo, Paulie. Maybe we'd just
better forget all this, you know?

420
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,711
- Just forget it.
- Forget nothin'. Say somethin' funny.

421
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,957
Ain't nothin' to say.
She's in a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood...

422
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,640
You know how to do funny.
Wanna go out with her?

423
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,115
- Yeah.
- Well...

424
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,800
- I don't know what to say.
- Funny.

425
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,674
Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.

426
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,791
Rocky, you know?

427
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,876
Listen, uh...

428
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,638
I dunno what to say, cos I ain't never
talked to no door before, you know?

429
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,912
- I mean, what do I say to a door? Listen...
- Come on, you're doin' fine.

430
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,270
I ain't doin' fine. I look like an idiot.

431

Keep doin' what you're doin'.
Funny. I know all about these things.

432
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,636
I feel like a jerk.

433
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,635
Yo, Adrian. It's Rocky again, you know?

434
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,830
Listen, uh...

435
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,520
I know you ain't too happy
at this moment.

436
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,077
Well, could you do me a favour? I ain't
got nobody to spend Thanksgiving with.

437
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,069
So, uh, how about maybe you and I could
go out together and get somethin' to eat?

438
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,873
I don't know,
maybe laugh a little bit. Who knows?

439
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,355
Would you like to, uh...

440
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:02,269
I don't know. Would you like to maybe,
you know, you and me go out together?

441
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,788
We're gonna have a good time.

442
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,310
We'll have a real good time, you know?

443
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,795
Thanks for the bird.

444
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,478
I'm gonna turn the TV off.
I got a headache.

445
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,475
- What's your sister like to do?
- Ice-skate.

446
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,549
Adrian, come on, you're lettin' the heat
out. Who pays the bills around here?

447
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,589
Listen, uh, I don't want
no turkey anyway, you know?

448
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,189
- But it was Thanksgiving.
- It was what?

449
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,472
- It was Thanksgiving.
- Yeah, to you, but to me it's Thursday.

450
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,548
- Yo, looks kinda quiet.
- I think it's closed.

451
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,717
No, I think we're just early
or somethin' like that.

452
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,034
- Yo!
- Yo!

453
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,071
- We're closed!
- What?

454
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,919
- I said we're closed!
- Yeah. Hey, listen...

455
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,191
...l'm gonna smooth this guy out.
Wait here for a few minutes.

456
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,515
- We could go someplace else.
- No, it's OK.

457
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,950
Are you closed to the general public
or closed to everybody?

458
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,392
It's after six o'clock. It's Thanksgiving.
That's why there's nobody here.

459
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,638
Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here,
so do me a favour and leave, huh?

460
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,548
- Could you do me a favour?
- Hey, come on, we're not operatin'.

461
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,319
Look... this girl here ain't feelin' well.

462
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,877
The doctor says she should exercise
and ice-skating's the best thing.

463
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,198
- Yeah? So what do you want from me?
- Do me a favour. She ain't feelin' good.

464
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,676
So if you could let her on the ice,
I'd appreciate it.

465
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,588
- Ten minutes, ten bucks.
- Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?

466
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,950
Come on! It's Thanksgiving.

467
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,029
- All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.
- You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.

468
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,238
Gimme the blades.

469
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,112
- Aren't you skating?
- No, I ain't skated since I was 15.

470
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,549
That's when I started fightin'.

471
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,150
- Skating's bad for the ankles, you know?
- Yeah.

472
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,840
You're a pretty good skater, ain't ya?

473
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,993
Like I was sayin' on the way over, fightin'
used to be tops with me, but no more.

474
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,634
All I wanted to do was
prove I was no bum...

475
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,069
...that I had the stuff to make a good pro.

476
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,670
- You never got the chance?
- I ain't cryin', cos I still fight.

477
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,156
I kinda do it like a hobby.
The trouble is, I'm a southpaw.

478
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,158
- What's a southpaw?
- It means you're left-handed.

479
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,510
A southpaw throws your timin' off, see?

480
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,428
Other guys, it makes 'em look awkward.
Nobody wants to look awkward.

481
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,996
<i>- You know where southpaw came from?
- (attendant) Nine minutes!</i>

482
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,908
A long time ago, a couple of hundred
years ago, this guy was fightin'.

483
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,350
I think it was around Philadelphia.
He was left-handed.

484
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,789
His arm was facin' towards New Jersey.

485
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,037
And that's south,
so they called him Southpaw.

486
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,754
You see? Southpaw, South Jersey...

487
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,997
...South Camden, Southpaw...
You know what I mean?

488
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,551
Things worked out for the best.

489
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,194
You never got a chance,
being left-handed?

490
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,869
Well, that's absolutely true,
you know? Watch out, watch out.

491
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,833
Agh! Agh! Agh!

492
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,157
I just dislocated my finger.
Agh! Look at that.

493
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,589
No, hey, wait! It ain't your fault. Look.

494
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,632
See? Look.
It's an old wound. You see that?

495
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,435
Look. See? Nothin'.
It bends like that. I originally done it...

496
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,516
Push the button... Bong! It works.

497
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,996
- It ain't your fault. I'll show you...
- Seven minutes!

498
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,032
I originally done it...
I keep pictures of all my fights.

499
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,594
I done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See?

500
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,713
He's the size of an airplane.
I broke both my hands.

501
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:15,676
I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,
don't you think? See how it works there?

502
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,791
Come on. Are you havin' a good time?

503
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,833
I'll tell ya, you can see I ain't too graceful.
I don't move well.

504
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,872
But I can really swat, you know?
I can really hit hard.

505
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,949
But I'm a southpaw and nobody wants to
fight a southpaw, you know what I mean?

506
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,995
Whooo!
You know how I got started in fightin'?

507
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,076
- Huh?
- No.

508
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,191
Am I talkin' too loud?

509
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,673
- No.
- Three minutes!

510
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,157
My father, he's...
My old man, he was never too smart.

511
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,717
He says to me "You weren't born
much of a brain, so start usin' your body."

512
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,195
So I've become a fighter.

513
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,676
You know what I mean?
Why are you laughin'?

514
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,759
My mother, she said the opposite thing.

515
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,519
What did she say?
What did she say, the opposite?

516
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,633
"You weren't born much of a body,
so you'd better develop your brain."

517
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,797
- Did she say that?
- Yo! Time!

518
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,398
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely.

519
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,598
- Why do you wanna fight?
- Cos I can't sing or dance.

520
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,312
Hey, yo!

521
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,079
Don't fall! Don't fall!

522
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,875
Hey, that was terrific. I'm good at this.
You like the way I skate?

523
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,878
The last fight I had was
with a guy named Spider Rico.

524
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,594
He bust my head up.
Do you see that scar?

525
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,518
I'll tell ya,
things get pretty rough in the ring.

526
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,155
You know, some people are
very shy by nature, you know?

527
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,236
I suppose.

528
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,313
I say you're very shy by nature,
you know?

529
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,396
Yeah... I suppose.

530
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,198
Hey! Hey!

531
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,551
The bum from the dock.
Get a job, ya bum!

532
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:09,151
You know, some people think bein' shy
is a disease, but it don't bother me none.

533
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,430
It don't bother me, either.

534
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,154
Why did I bother bringin' it up?
Cos I'm dumb, that's why.

535
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,595
I think we make a real sharp couple
of coconuts. I'm dumb, you're shy.

536
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,315
I don't understand why anybody
would wanna be a fighter.

537
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,476
Hey, you gotta be a moron.

538
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,956
You gotta be a moron to wanna be
a fighter, you know what I mean?

539
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,390
It's a racket where you're almost
guaranteed to end up a bum.

540
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,910
- I don't think you're a bum.
- I'm at least half a bum, you know?

541
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,759
I'll tell ya somethin'.

542
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,395
The worst thing about fightin'
is the mornin' after, you know?

543
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,150
I'll tell ya. The mornin' after a fight, you're
nothin' but a large wound, you know?

544
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,236
Sometimes I got pains all over me.

545
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,796
I wanna call a taxi to take me
from the bed into the bathroom.

546
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,471
Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt, your face
is all busted up, your hands is swollen.

547
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,752
Look at this face. 64 fights.
Look at that nose. See that nose?

548
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,110
That nose ain't been broken in 64 fights.

549
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,597
I've had guys bustin' on it,
chewin' on it, twistin' it, punchin' it.

550
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,759
I mean, whack, boom. These guys
are hittin' my nose all the time.

551
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,350
Never broke. I'm proud of that.
Ain't that rare? That's rare.

552
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,597
- Why do you do it if it hurts?
- Why you think?

553
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,675
- Cos you can't sing or dance?
- Yeah, somethin' like that.

554
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,870
Hey, you wanna come inside?

555
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,232
- No, I gotta go.
- Hey, come on. I got some animals.

556
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,114
I got these very rare animals inside.
Come on. Come on in.

557
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,030
- No, no. I gotta go.
- I gotta go too. I gotta go to the bathroom.

558
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,674
- Go on.
- No, I gotta go.

559
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,712
Hey, look at this face.
Is that a face you could trust?

560
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,550
Huh? Is it? They oughta stick this face
on a stamp. What do you think?

561
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,035
Huh? Come on. Come on in.

562
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,670
Yo.

563
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,636
Flick.

564
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,232
- Yo, Adrian, you hungry?
- No.

565
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,956
I got some things in there. I got soda,
some doughnuts or somethin'.

566
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,275
A couple of cupcakes, huh?

567
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,517
No? I think I got some chocolate in there.

568
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,596
No?

569
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,835
Hot in here, you know?

570
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,595
I could go for some music.

571
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,392
Yo, Adrian.

572
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,080
These are the exotic animals
I told you about.

573
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,431
- These are my friends Cuff and Link.
- I sold 'em to ya.

574
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,314
Sure, I know you sold 'em to me.
You were workin' at that pet shop.

575
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,796
First day you was there,
I bought both these animals.

576
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,675
Sure, I remember that. I bought this bowl
and I bought the animals themselves...

577
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,758
...the food,
the marbles that go on the bottom there.

578
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,637
Remember that mountain? I had to get rid
of it, cos they kept fallin' over and flippin'.

579
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,353
Yo, why don't you come on
over here and sit down?

580
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,311
Hm?

581
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,590
It's a nice couch. I don't know...

582
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,348
There's big bugs in there, you know?
It's safer over here.

583
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,116
You wanna sit down?

584
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,635
Are these your parents?

585
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,990
Yeah, that's both of 'em there.

586
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,634
- Is this you?
- Yeah, that's me when I was eight.

587
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,957
That's the Italian Stallion
when he was a baby.

588
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,237
Why don't you come on over and
make yourself comfortable? Relax.

589
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,634
- Do you have a phone?
- No, I ain't got no phone.

590
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,957
I had it pulled,
cos of people callin' all the time.

591
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,550
Who needs the aggravation, right?
The interruptions.

592
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,832
- Who do you wanna call?
- I wanna let my brother know where I am.

593
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,149
Why?

594
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:43,035
- I think he might be worried.
- Well, I'll call him, if that's the problem.

595
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,230
Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me!
I'll call ya's back later! See ya!

596
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,630
You don't like the room, do ya?

597
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,832
- It's fine.
- Well, it's only temporary, you know?

598
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,076
It's not that.

599
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,389
<i>What's the problem? You don't like me?
Or the turtles? What's the problem?</i>

600
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,478
- I don't think I belong here.
- It's OK.

601
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,275
I don't belong here.

602
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,439
Well, you know, it's OK,
cos you're my guest, you know?

603
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,313
I don't... know you well enough.

604
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,228
I've never been in
a man's apartment alone.

605
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,398
Well, I have.
They're all the same, you know?

606
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,680
I'm not sure I know you well enough.

607
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,876
I don't feel comfortable.

608
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,754
Yo, Adrian, you know,
I ain't so comfortable either.

609
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,271
- I should go.
- Don't go, please. Don't go.

610
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,709
Don't go. Don't go.

611
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,796
Don't go.

612
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,239
- Do me a favour?
- What?

613
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,715
Take off these glasses.

614
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,195
You have nice eyes, you know?

615
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,393
Do me another favour?

616
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,875
Would you take off that hat?

617
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,195
I always knew you was pretty.

618
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,913
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not teasin' ya.

619
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,719
I ain't teasin' ya.

620
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,195
I just... I wanna kiss ya.

621
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,917
You don't have to kiss me back
if you don't want...

622
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,996
...but I wanna kiss you.

623
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,796
I heard you had a fight comin' up.

624
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,798
Yeah, I'm gonna fight next month,
January 27th.

625
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,914
That's good, man. You come on down
the gym. We'll see that you get in shape.

626
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,951
Hey, Rock, how you doin'?

627
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,152
- Mick was lookin' for you up there, man.
- For me? You sure?

628
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,432
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was lookin' for you.
Get on up there and see him.

629
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,718
- You got somethin' for me?
- A guy from Miles Jergens was here.

630
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,753
- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
- When was he here?

631
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,953
- About an hour ago.
- Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.

632
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,033
I said that before, you dumb dago!

633
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,312
I've been comin' here for six years
and you always stick it to me. How come?

634
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,318
- You don't wanna know!
- Yeah, I wanna know how come!

635
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,476
- You wanna know?
- I wanna know!

636
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,196
OK, I'm gonna tell ya! Cos you had
the talent to become a good fighter!

637
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,039
And instead of that,
you became a leg-breaker...

638
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,197
...to some cheap, second-rate loan shark!

639
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,232
- It's a livin'.
- It's a waste of life!

640
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,390
Yes? May I help you?

641
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,310
Oh! You must be Mr Rocky Balboa.

642
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,398
Mr Jergens is expecting you.
Just a moment.

643
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,913
Mr Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.

644
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,951
Fine.

645
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,355
- Please go in, Mr Balboa.
- Can I have that?

646
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,835
- Oh, certainly.
- Thanks.

647
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,196
Mr Balboa.

648
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,790
How are you? George Jergens.
Take a chair, please.

649
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,876
Thanks.

650
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,240
- Mr Balboa...
- You can call me Rocky.

651
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,751
Rocky. Tell me, Rocky. You got any
representation? You have a manager?

652
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,836
Uh, no, just me.

653
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,509
Rocky, I've got a proposition
I'd like to make to you.

654
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,871
- About sparrin'?
- I beg your pardon?

655
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,357
I know you're lookin' for sparrin' partners
and I wanna say I'm very available.

656
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,677
- I'm sure you are.
- Absolutely. It would be an honour.

657
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,758
And you know what?
I wouldn't take no cheap shots.

658
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,670
- I'd really be a good sparrin' partner.
- You don't understand me, Rocky.

659
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,669
My proposition's this. Would you be
interested in fighting Apollo Creed...

660
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,553
...for the world
heavyweight championship?

661
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,235
- No.
- Listen, Rocky...

662
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,596
...Apollo's seen you fight.

663
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,038
He likes you. He wants to fight you.

664
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,914
Well, it's just that, you see, uh,
I fight in clubs, you know?

665
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,431
I'm really a ham and egger. This guy is
the best. It wouldn't be such a good fight.

666
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,348
But thank you very much,
you know? I appreciate it.

667
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,952
Rocky, do you believe that America
is the land of opportunity?

668
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,912
Yeah.

669
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,031
Apollo Creed does.

670
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,790
And he's gonna prove it to the world
by giving an unknown a shot at the title.

671
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,639
And that unknown is you.

672
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,910
He picked you, Rocky.

673
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,837
Rocky, it's the chance of a lifetime.

674
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,110
You can't pass it by.

675
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,150
What do ya say?

676
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,868
<i>All right. That's enough pictures.
We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.</i>

677
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,394
<i>How do you like
the city of brotherly love?</i>

678
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,830
<i>Well, just bein' in Philadelphia
makes me feel patriotic.</i>

679
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,509
<i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city
wishin' me the best.</i>

680
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,996
<i>I love my Philadelphia brothers.
I'm proud to be an American.</i>

681
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,671
<i>Apollo, why did you agree to fight a man
who has virtually no chance of winning?</i>

682
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,916
<i>Look, if history proves one thing...</i>

683
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,555
<i>American history proves that
everybody's got a chance to win.</i>

684
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,150
<i>Didn't you guys ever hear of
Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>

685
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,352
<i>It is a coincidence that
you're fighting a white man...</i>

686
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,675
<i>... on the most celebrated day
in US history?</i>

687
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:32,193
<i>I don't know. Is it a coincidence that he's
fightin' a black man on the same day?</i>

688
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,276
<i>Right on! Tell the truth, brother!</i>

689
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,789
<i>How do you feel about your challenger?</i>

690
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,878
<i>How do I feel about him?
Come here, Rock.</i>

691
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,834
<i>- My main man. Rocky, ain't you Italian?
- Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>

692
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,511
<i>- Well now, what does that mean?
- If he can't fight, I bet he can cook!</i>

693
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,914
- Do me a favour. His lungs, punch out.
- Paulie!

694
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,316
<i>Rocky,
how do you expect to fight Apollo Creed?</i>

695
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,399
<i>Well, jeez, Creed's the best.
I guess I'll have to do the best I can.</i>

696
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,193
<i>Tell me, Rocky. Just between us...</i>

697
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,118
<i>... where did you get
the name "ltalian Stallion"?</i>

698
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:11,472
<i>Oh, I invented that about eight years ago
when I was eatin' dinner.</i>

699
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:17,470
<i>Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000.
Any comment?</i>

700
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,390
<i>- You got no comment, Rocky, right?
- No.</i>

701
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,238
<i>No comment, right.</i>

702
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,830
<i>Wait a minute.
I just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, OK?</i>

703
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,078
<i>Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.
Look at this. Can you believe all this?</i>

704
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,033
Rocky, you didn't...!

705
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,958
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.
- Quit pushin', man!</i>

706
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,149
<i>Thank you, Rocky.</i>

707
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,114
Don't it matter he's makin' you out a fool?
I'd break his lips.

708
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,277
- He's takin' cheap shots.
- It don't bother me none.

709
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,235
Yo, Rock. I guess you'd be lookin'
for people to help you out.

710
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,920
- Help what?
- You know...

711
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,715
- Keep you livin' a clean life.
- I do OK, you know?
