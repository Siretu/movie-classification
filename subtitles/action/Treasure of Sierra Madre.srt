1
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,275
Say, buddy, will you stake a fellow...

2
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:53,196
Hey, mister, will you stake
a fellow American to a meal?

3
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:17,523
- State lottery, señor?
- Beat it. I ain't buying no lottery tickets.

4
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:19,258
4,000 pesos is the big prize.

5
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:21,733
Get away from me, you little beggar.

6
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:25,562
The whole ticket is only 4 pesos.
It's a sure winner.

7
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,402
I ain't got 4 pesos.

8
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:30,068
Buy a quarter of a ticket for 1 peso silver.

9
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:34,410
If you don't get away from me,
I'll throw this water right in your face.

10
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:38,877
Then one tenth of a ticket, señor, for 40...

11
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,456
Señor, buy one twentieth.
One twentieth costs you only 20 centavos.

12
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,696
Look, señor, add the figures up.
You get 13.

13
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:52,790
What better number could you buy?
It's a sure winner.

14
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:56,762
- Yeah, how soon's the drawing?
- Only three weeks off.

15
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,339
Give me a twentieth
so I don't have to look at your ugly face.

16
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:04,605
Come again next time.

17
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:08,207
I always have the winners,
all the lucky numbers. Good luck.

18
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:09,745
Thirteen.

19
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:24,660
Excuse me.

20
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,501
Cigarette?

21
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:38,335
Thanks.

22
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:41,707
- It's hot.
- Yeah.

23
00:03:49,324 --> 00:03:52,350
What a town, Tampico.

24
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,858
You said it, brother.

25
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:58,593
If I could get a job
that'd bring enough to buy passage...

26
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,569
I'd shake its dust off my feet
soon enough, you bet.

27
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:05,006
If I was a native,
I'd get a can of shoe polish...

28
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:07,871
and I'd be in business.
They'd never let a gringo.

29
00:04:09,212 --> 00:04:11,908
You can sit on a bench
till you're three-quarters starved.

30
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:14,881
You can beg from another gringo,
or even commit burglary.

31
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,918
You try shining shoes in the street...

32
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:20,114
or peddling lemonade out of a bucket
and your hash is settled.

33
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,351
You'll never get another job
from an American.

34
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:25,325
Yeah, and the natives
would hound and pester you to death.

35
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:28,296
- Some town to be broke in.
- What town isn't?

36
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:37,265
Can you stake a fellow American
to a meal?

37
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:17,268
Hey, mister.

38
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:19,570
Will you stake a fellow American
to a meal?

39
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:21,669
Such impudence never came my way.

40
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:23,543
Early this afternoon, I gave you money.

41
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:25,879
When my shoes were being polished,
I gave you more.

42
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,611
Now you put the bite on me again.

43
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:29,984
Do me a favor.
Go occasionally to somebody else.

44
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:33,617
- It's beginning to get tiresome.
- Excuse me. I didn't know it was you.

45
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,093
I never looked at your face, just
your hands and the money you gave me.

46
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:40,131
Beg pardon. I promise
I'll never put the bite on you again.

47
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:42,167
This is the very last you get from me.

48
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:45,965
Just to make sure you don't forget
your promise, here's another peso.

49
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,164
- Thanks, mister.
- But from now on...

50
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:51,732
you have to make your way through life
without my assistance.

51
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:02,815
Hey, buddy, will you stake
a fellow American to a meal?

52
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,654
I won't give you a red cent.

53
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,192
If you want to make some money
I'll give you a job.

54
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,158
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.

55
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,890
I got a job if you want.
It's hard work, but good pay.

56
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,898
- Did you ever rig a camp?
- Sure.

57
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,400
The ferry's making off,
one of my men hasn't shown up.

58
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,734
I don't know what's happened to him.
He's probably drunk in some dive.

59
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:22,399
- What's the pay?
- $8 a day.

60
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,934
Don't just stand there.
Make up your mind, the ferry doesn't wait.

61
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,913
- I'm your man.
- Come on.

62
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,095
- Hello, there.
- Hello, yourself.

63
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,627
Okay, you guys, get aboard.

64
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,476
Take it your way.

65
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:36,749
What's the matter with you two?
Can't you take it?

66
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:40,447
It's 130 in the shade, and there ain't
any shade up there on that derrick.

67
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:44,514
Just figure you're a couple of millionaires
in your own private steam bath.

68
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,183
And the sooner we're through...

69
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,354
the sooner we'll be back in town
drinking cold beer.

70
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,524
We finish within two weeks,
I'm giving you fellas a bonus.

71
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,763
Yeah, it's coming to us
working 16, 18 hours a day like we do.

72
00:08:55,837 --> 00:08:57,930
Don't go crying to your mamas.
What do you want?

73
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,235
I'm paying top salaries and a bonus.

74
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:02,606
What about our pay anyway,
and when do we get it?

75
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:06,078
- I ain't seen a buck out of you yet.
- You'll get your dough, all right...

76
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:08,843
don't worry about that,
when we get back to Tampico.

77
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,477
What could you do with money out here
anyway, except gamble and lose it?

78
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,817
You'll be paid as we step off the ferry.

79
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:40,177
The agent was supposed to be here
with the dough.

80
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:41,715
Don't know what could've happened.

81
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,718
But don't worry.
I'll go to the office and pick up the money.

82
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:46,253
You men stay here.

83
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:48,585
Any objection to a couple of us
coming with you?

84
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:50,852
Don't you trust me?
You think I'd run out on you?

85
00:09:50,926 --> 00:09:52,518
I don't think you'd do that.

86
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:56,621
But I ain't got a cent, not even enough
to buy me a glass of beer.

87
00:09:57,099 --> 00:10:00,398
Say, you two guys meet me
over at the Cantina Madrid.

88
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:03,666
It's 2:15 now and I'll be over there
no later than 3:00.

89
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:10,410
Pat McCormick.
He comes here from time to time.

90
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,674
I haven't seen him lately.

91
00:10:11,748 --> 00:10:14,012
Pat McCormick?
What about Pat McCormick?

92
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:17,347
- He's supposed to meet us here.
- Does he owe you any money?

93
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:20,817
Say, how long you guys
been around Tampico, anyway?

94
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,517
What's that got to do with it?

95
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:26,254
Only foreigners and half-baked Americans
fall for McCormick's tricks.

96
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:27,420
How do you mean?

97
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:30,022
I mean, he hires dumb guys like you
to work for him.

98
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:32,966
When it comes time to pay off,
he takes a powder.

99
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:39,801
How much we got left
of that $10 he gave us, Dobbsie?

100
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:43,471
- $2.50.
- That's not even enough for one bed.

101
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:48,714
I know a joint that's full of rats,
scorpions and cockroaches.

102
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:52,884
The cots are only 50 centavos a night.

103
00:10:57,695 --> 00:10:59,093
Have another...

104
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:14,209
...jobs for a dime a dozen
ain't to be had at all.

105
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:15,506
Streets are full of guys...

106
00:11:15,913 --> 00:11:17,710
pushing each other over the hill.

107
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,840
...not 10 days from here by rail.

108
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:25,378
The mountain's waiting for the right guy
to discover and take her treasure.

109
00:11:25,456 --> 00:11:27,583
The question is: Are you the right guy?

110
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:30,751
Real bonanzas are few and far between.
They take a lot of finding.

111
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:34,059
Answer me this, will you?
Why is gold worth some $20 an ounce?

112
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:37,965
- I don't know. Because it's scarce.
- A thousand men go searching for gold.

113
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:40,903
After six months one of them's lucky.
One out of the thousand.

114
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:45,169
His find represents not only his own labor
but that of 999 others to boot.

115
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:48,605
That's 6,000 months to 500 years...

116
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:51,274
scrambling over mountain,
going hungry and thirsty.

117
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:55,751
The gold is worth what it is 'cause of
the human labor that went into finding it.

118
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:58,846
- Never thought of it like that.
- There's no other explanation.

119
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:02,825
Gold ain't good for nothing
except for making jewelry and gold teeth.

120
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:04,360
Gold's a devilish sort of thing.

121
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:08,297
You start out to tell yourself
you'll be satisfied with $25,000 worth.

122
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:11,335
So help me Lord and cross my heart.
Fine resolution.

123
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:15,031
After months of sweating yourself dizzy,
few provisions, finding nothing...

124
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:17,267
you finally come down to $15,000,
then $10,000.

125
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:20,470
Finally you say,
"Lord, let me just find $5,000 worth...

126
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:23,207
"and I'll never ask for anything more
the rest of my life."

127
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:25,272
$5,000 is a lot of money.

128
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:27,715
In this joint it seems like a lot.

129
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:30,619
But if you made a real strike,
you couldn't be dragged away.

130
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:33,988
Even the threat of death wouldn't
keep you from adding $10,000 more.

131
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:36,892
$10,000, you'd want $25,000.
$25,000, you'd want $50,000.

132
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:38,792
$50,000, $100,000. Like roulette.

133
00:12:38,863 --> 00:12:41,161
One more time, you know.
Always one more.

134
00:12:41,232 --> 00:12:44,498
It wouldn't be that way with me.
I swear, it wouldn't.

135
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:47,169
I'd take only what I set out to get.

136
00:12:47,238 --> 00:12:49,798
Even if there was still $500,000 worth...

137
00:12:49,874 --> 00:12:51,967
lying around, waiting to be picked up.

138
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:54,478
I've dug in Alaska
and Canada and Colorado.

139
00:12:54,547 --> 00:12:57,516
I was in the British Honduras,
I made my fare back home...

140
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,244
and almost enough over
to cure me of the fever I'd caught.

141
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:04,050
Dug in California and Australia.
All over the world practically.

142
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:06,952
Yeah. I know what gold does
to men's souls.

143
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,429
You talk as though you struck it rich
sometime or other, pop.

144
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:11,827
How about it?

145
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:15,326
Then what are you doing in here,
a down-and-outer?

146
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:17,733
That's gold. That's what it makes us.

147
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:20,397
Never knew a prospector yet
that died rich.

148
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:23,465
Make one fortune, he's sure to blow it
trying to find another.

149
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:25,635
I'm no exception to the rule.

150
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:31,177
Sure I'm a gnawed old bone now
but don't you guys think the spirit's gone.

151
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:34,819
I'm set to shoulder a pickaxe
if anybody's willing to share expenses.

152
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:37,185
I'd rather go by myself.
It's best to go alone.

153
00:13:37,257 --> 00:13:40,818
But you got to have a stomach
for loneliness. Some guys go nutty with it.

154
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:44,351
But going with a partner is dangerous.
Murderers always lurking about.

155
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,400
Partners accusing each other
of all sorts of crimes.

156
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:52,369
As long as there's no find,
the noble brotherhood will last.

157
00:13:52,438 --> 00:13:56,808
But when the piles of gold begin to grow,
that's when the trouble starts.

158
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:01,810
I wouldn't mind
a little of that kind of trouble.

159
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:04,308
I think I'll go to sleep...

160
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:07,045
and dream about piles of gold...

161
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,647
getting bigger and bigger.

162
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:17,953
Do you believe what the old man...

163
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:20,431
who was doing all the talking
at the Oso Negro...

164
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,195
said the other night...

165
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:26,000
about gold changing a man's soul
so that he ain't the same kind of a guy...

166
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:28,632
that he was before finding it?

167
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,573
Guess that all depends on the man.

168
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:32,613
That's exactly what I say.

169
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:35,073
Gold don't carry any curse with it.

170
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:39,380
It all depends on whether or not
the guy who finds it is the right guy.

171
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:41,116
The way I see it...

172
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:43,919
gold can be as much of a blessing
as a curse.

173
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,889
Look who's coming out
of the Hotel Bristol.

174
00:14:51,032 --> 00:14:53,557
Is that Pat McCormick
or am I seeing things?

175
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,000
It's him.

176
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,631
- Let's get him.
- Let's get him hard.

177
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:04,806
Why don't you and me
go and buy me something?

178
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,245
I could use a new pair of shoes.

179
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,639
Hello, fellows, how are you?
Glad to see you.

180
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:12,447
- Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Curtin, Señorita...
- López.

181
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,148
López. I want you guys
to come and have a drink with me.

182
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:18,159
I've got business
to attend to with these men.

183
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:20,956
You go back up to the hotel and wait.
I won't be long.

184
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:23,831
Okay.

185
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:26,493
Fellas, let's have that drink.
Where have you been?

186
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:28,729
I've been looking all over for you.

187
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:34,675
Three shots of rye.

188
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:36,438
Make mine brandy, Three Star.

189
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:39,036
- Two brandies.
- Rye is good enough for me.

190
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:42,647
I suppose you're wondering
about that money that's coming to you.

191
00:15:42,717 --> 00:15:45,812
The fact is I haven't been paid off
on that contract myself.

192
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:50,052
If I had the money, you'd get it first thing.
I'll put you both on my next contract.

193
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,855
It will come through by Monday
and we can set out Friday.

194
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:54,555
Here's mud in your eye.

195
00:15:57,532 --> 00:16:00,365
We want what's coming to us.
We want it right here and now.

196
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:02,927
- But didn't I just tell you...
- You better come across.

197
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,574
And the balance, say,
the middle of next week?

198
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:11,079
Nothing doing. Right here and now.

199
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:14,309
Every cent or you won't walk out of here.
You'll be carried out.

200
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:17,147
Let's don't stop being friends.
How about another drink?

201
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:19,585
Two more brandies.
Put the bottle on the bar.

202
00:16:19,655 --> 00:16:21,681
If you want to get us liquored up...

203
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:25,420
No, I'm just inviting you
to have a friendly drink with me.

204
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:34,257
- I'm licked, boys.
- Give us our money.

205
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:36,826
Yeah, give us our money.

206
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:42,036
I can't see.

207
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:49,111
$50. $100.

208
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:51,208
$200.

209
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,338
$300.

210
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:56,344
- That's it, ain't it, Curt?
- Yeah, that's it.

211
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:00,854
Let's beat it before the law arrives.

212
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:06,523
Here's for the drinks
and the use of the cantina.

213
00:18:11,102 --> 00:18:13,195
- You know something, Curt?
- What?

214
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:17,999
We ain't very smart,
hanging around Tampico waiting for a job.

215
00:18:18,643 --> 00:18:20,167
Money's getting shorter every day...

216
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:23,305
and soon we'll be right back
where we were, on the bum again...

217
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:26,908
pushing guys for dimes,
sleeping around in freight cars.

218
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:29,316
That's right. Got any ideas?

219
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:33,486
That old man in the Oso Negro
started me to thinking.

220
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:34,547
What about?

221
00:18:34,626 --> 00:18:37,060
Why not try gold-digging for a change?

222
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:39,858
It ain't any riskier
than waiting around here for a break...

223
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:43,298
and this is the country where the nuggets
of gold are crying for you...

224
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:47,304
to take them out of the ground,
make them shine in coins...

225
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:50,903
on the fingers and necks of swell dames.

226
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:54,738
One thing, living in the open is cheaper
than it is here in Tampico.

227
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:55,803
Our money'd last longer.

228
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:59,543
The longer it lasts, the greater our chance
of digging something up would be.

229
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:01,482
We'd have to have equipment, all right.

230
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:05,888
Picks and spades, pans, burros.
Wonder how much it would all cost.

231
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:09,456
- That old man would know.
- Yeah, he could give us some pointers.

232
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:12,861
He's too old to take along.
We'd have to pack him on our backs.

233
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:14,763
You can't tell
about some of those old guys.

234
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:17,632
It's surprising sometimes
how tough they are.

235
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:20,034
I don't know what gold looks like
in the ground.

236
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:23,701
I've only seen it in jewelry store windows
and people's mouths.

237
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,305
You know anything about prospecting?

238
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:28,905
Not much when you come right down to it.

239
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:32,041
We might have real use
for an experienced guy like that old-timer.

240
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:34,211
Let's go hunt him up right away.

241
00:19:36,122 --> 00:19:38,785
Will I go? What a question.
Of course I'll go.

242
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:41,487
Any time, any day,
I was waiting for somebody to ask me.

243
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,926
Out for gold? I'm always at your service.

244
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:47,592
I got $300 ready cash in the bank.
$200 of it all set to invest.

245
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,192
Last money I got.
When it's gone, I'm finished.

246
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,397
If you don't take a risk,
you can't make a game.

247
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:54,098
How much dough you guys got to put in?

248
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:56,734
I've got $150 and Curtin's got the same.

249
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,439
$500 ain't hardly enough to buy tools,
weapons and essential provisions.

250
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:01,845
What do we need weapons for?

251
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:03,848
Meat's one thing and bandits another.

252
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,080
Bandit country's where we'd be going.
We need $600 between us.

253
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:09,520
- That much?
- Can't you dig up any more?

254
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:11,253
Not a red cent.

255
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:16,528
Give me my money, señor!

256
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:19,891
Get away from me, will you?

257
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:22,093
Please, señor.
Whoever draws the lucky number...

258
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:23,762
gives a present to the seller...

259
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:25,236
I don't want any lottery ticket!

260
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:28,172
If you don't, you have bad luck
the rest of your life.

261
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,367
What? Wait a minute.
What did you first say?

262
00:20:31,444 --> 00:20:34,903
Why, he's trying to tell you
he sold you the winning ticket.

263
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:36,810
Hey, wait a minute.

264
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:38,774
This what you mean?

265
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:41,553
- You say it's the winner?
- 200 peso prize.

266
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:43,180
Where?

267
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:46,021
- That's my number.
- Sure enough.

268
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:49,255
Just look at that fat, rich, printed number.

269
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:53,663
That's the kind of sugar poppa likes.
200 pesos.

270
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:56,134
Welcome, sweet little smackeroos.

271
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:59,095
Here, son, here's a present for you
with my blessing.

272
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,770
Would you like to shake the hand
that bought that ticket?

273
00:21:04,845 --> 00:21:06,938
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, yourself.

274
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:09,312
You stand a profit out of this
the same as I do.

275
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:10,372
How do you make that out?

276
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:13,887
Didn't he just say we needed $600?
That's what we've got now, ain't it?

277
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:15,115
- Yeah, but...
- But what?

278
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:18,523
- Why are you putting up for me?
- This is an all-or-nothing proposition.

279
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:22,290
If we make a find,
we'll be lighting our cigars with $100 bills.

280
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:24,888
If not, the difference
between what you and I put up...

281
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:27,800
ain't enough to keep me
from being where I was this afternoon:

282
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,360
Polishing a bench
with the seat of my pants.

283
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:32,065
Put her there, part.

284
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,825
We'll buy our burros at Perla and
head northwest away from the railroad.

285
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,552
It's no use looking near a railroad...

286
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:54,061
or any kind of a road at all...

287
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:57,860
because construction engineers examine
every bit of ground around the road...

288
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,093
while they're building them.

289
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,862
We got to go where there's no trails...

290
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:05,339
where no surveyor or anyone who knows
anything of prospecting has been before.

291
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,772
The best place to go to is...

292
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:11,211
where any salaried person wouldn't go,
because he wouldn't want to risk his hide.

293
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:16,345
I got three of them!
How many did you get?

294
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:18,904
- A couple.
- I'm one up. I bet I got more than you did.

295
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,278
I got three. Nice shooting?

296
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,183
That bullet hole's two inches
from my head. That was close.

297
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:25,585
The bullets were sure flying
thick and fast in here.

298
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:27,283
It sounded like a swarm of bees here.

299
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:30,849
That bandit with the gold hat,
I had my sights on him, nice as you please.

300
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:33,396
The train gave a jolt and I missed.
Wish I'd got him.

301
00:23:33,464 --> 00:23:35,830
Big boulder on the track so train stop.

302
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:39,562
Bandits got big surprise because soldiers
on the train waiting for them.

303
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:41,103
Not many passengers get killed.

304
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,798
Here's where we're bound for.

305
00:23:42,873 --> 00:23:45,239
Don't show whether there's mountain,
swamp or desert.

306
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:47,675
That shows the makers of the map
don't know.

307
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:50,270
Once on the ground,
we open our eyes and look around.

308
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:53,180
Blow our noses, too.
Believe it or not, I knew a fellow...

309
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,117
who could smell gold
like a jackass can smell water.

310
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:47,298
What's all that about?

311
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:49,636
We're going into country
very wild and dangerous.

312
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:51,004
Have to cut through jungles...

313
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:53,805
and climb mountains so high
they rise above the clouds.

314
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:57,940
Tigers so strong they can climb trees
with burros in their mouths. Good.

315
00:24:58,017 --> 00:25:01,952
Glad to hear such tall tales 'cause it
means few outsiders have set foot there.

316
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,852
Well, let's get going.

317
00:26:11,424 --> 00:26:15,189
If there was gold in them mountains,
how long would it have been there?

318
00:26:15,261 --> 00:26:18,026
Millions and millions of years, wouldn't it?

319
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:19,690
What's our hurry?

320
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:23,795
A couple of days more or less
ain't going to make any difference.

321
00:26:23,904 --> 00:26:26,236
Remember what you said
back in Tampico...

322
00:26:26,306 --> 00:26:29,400
about having to pack that old man
on our backs?

323
00:26:32,612 --> 00:26:36,014
That was when I took him
for an ordinary human being...

324
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:37,716
not part goat.

325
00:26:38,618 --> 00:26:40,643
Look at him climb, will you?

326
00:26:45,726 --> 00:26:49,183
What gets me is how he can go all day
in the sun without any water.

327
00:26:49,262 --> 00:26:51,355
Maybe he's part camel, too.

328
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:54,158
If I'd known what prospecting meant...

329
00:26:54,235 --> 00:26:58,193
I'd have stayed in Tampico
and waited for another job to turn up.

330
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:07,213
- What's the matter?
- Look.

331
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:12,849
Look at it glitter. It's yellow, too, like...

332
00:27:13,154 --> 00:27:14,246
Gold.

333
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:22,585
Come back, we've found something!

334
00:27:24,632 --> 00:27:27,761
Look, Curt, there's a vein of it,
here, in this rock.

335
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,201
Look here. Look, it's all around.

336
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:33,196
What else could it be?

337
00:27:33,407 --> 00:27:35,875
Only gold shines and glitters like that.

338
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:38,306
We've struck it, Curt.

339
00:27:40,148 --> 00:27:42,638
Look, from the looks of things...

340
00:27:43,851 --> 00:27:45,443
we've struck it rich.

341
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:47,751
Look, it's all over here.

342
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:50,049
- We found a what do you call it...
- Mother lode.

343
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,251
- That's right.
- Howard!

344
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:52,588
Come on. Look.

345
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:56,525
Here, look at this rock.
It's full of gold. Veins of it.

346
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:00,000
This stuff wouldn't pay your dinner
for a carload.

347
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:02,226
It ain't gold?

348
00:28:02,437 --> 00:28:04,098
Pyrite. Fool's gold.

349
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:06,737
Not that there ain't
plenty of the real stuff here.

350
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:08,776
We've walked over it four or five times.

351
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:11,369
A place yesterday looked like
rich diggings, but the water...

352
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:13,244
for washing the sand was 11 miles away.

353
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,910
The other places, there wasn't much gold
to pay us a good day's wages.

354
00:28:16,985 --> 00:28:19,419
Next time you strike it rich, holler for me...

355
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:22,287
before you start splashing water around.
Water's precious.

356
00:28:22,358 --> 00:28:24,918
Sometimes it can be more precious
than gold.

357
00:28:25,627 --> 00:28:26,651
Burro.

358
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:40,638
- What's up?
- Norther, looks like.

359
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,875
A "norther"? What's a "norther"?

360
00:28:43,446 --> 00:28:45,641
Big winds from the north
this time of year...

361
00:28:45,715 --> 00:28:49,742
when they blow hard, this desert country
stands right up on its hind legs!

362
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:01,653
There's only a few more miles
of this heavy stuff.

363
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:04,165
Pretty soon we'll be out of this valley.

364
00:29:44,775 --> 00:29:46,902
You fellows, how about some beans?

365
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:52,173
You want some beans?

366
00:29:54,985 --> 00:29:59,217
Going through some mighty rough country
tomorrow. You better have some beans.

367
00:30:40,064 --> 00:30:41,895
You know what I'm thinking?

368
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,627
I'm thinking we ought to give up...

369
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:46,700
leave the whole outfit...

370
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,729
everything behind.

371
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,205
Go back to civilization.

372
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:55,040
What's that you say? Go back?
Tell my old grandmother!

373
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:58,173
I got two elegant bedfellows
who kick at the first drop of rain...

374
00:30:58,249 --> 00:31:00,774
and hide in the closet
when thunder rumbles.

375
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:02,352
What great prospectors.

376
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,855
Two shoe clerks reading
about prospecting for gold...

377
00:31:04,924 --> 00:31:08,416
in the Land of the Midnight Sun,
south of the border or west of the Rockies.

378
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:10,688
Shut your trap or I'll smash your head flat!

379
00:31:10,762 --> 00:31:13,960
Go ahead, throw it. If you did,
you'd never leave this place alive.

380
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:17,093
Without me, you two would die here
more miserable than rats.

381
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:20,069
Leave him alone.
Can't you see the old man's nuts?

382
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:23,973
Nuts, am I? Let me tell you something,
my fine bedfellows.

383
00:31:24,043 --> 00:31:27,638
There's nothing to compare you with.
You're dumber than the dumbest jackass.

384
00:31:27,713 --> 00:31:28,737
Look at each other.

385
00:31:28,814 --> 00:31:32,375
Did you ever see anything like yourself
for being dumb specimens?

386
00:31:36,055 --> 00:31:37,079
You're so dumb...

387
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:40,888
you don't even see the riches
you're treading on with your own feet.

388
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:51,568
Don't expect to find nuggets
of molten gold.

389
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:53,935
It's not that rich.
Here ain't the place to dig.

390
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:56,497
It comes from someplace further up.
Up there.

391
00:31:56,575 --> 00:31:58,703
Up there's where we've got to go.

392
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:07,611
- Is that it?
- That's it, all right.

393
00:32:07,687 --> 00:32:08,984
Gold, I mean.

394
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:10,784
Sure don't look like I thought it would.

395
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:14,418
- Not much different from sand.
- Yeah. It's just like plain sand.

396
00:32:14,593 --> 00:32:16,220
It don't glitter. I thought it would.

397
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:18,662
It will when it's refined by some other guy.

398
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:20,962
All we got to do is mine it
and get it back there.

399
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:24,526
Gold ain't like stones in a riverbed.
It don't cry out to be picked up.

400
00:32:24,604 --> 00:32:26,196
You got to know how to recognize it.

401
00:32:26,273 --> 00:32:28,207
The finding ain't all. Not by a long shot.

402
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:30,903
Got to know how to tickle her
so she'll come out laughing.

403
00:32:30,977 --> 00:32:33,002
Yeah, it's mighty rich. It'll pay good.

404
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,605
- How good?
- About 20 ounces to the ton.

405
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,716
- That's $20 an ounce.
- How many tons can we handle a week?

406
00:32:38,785 --> 00:32:40,150
Depends on how hard we work.

407
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,313
We better pitch our camp
down the mountainside.

408
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:43,857
Why, when the digging's here?

409
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:46,917
Anyone comes by, we say we're hunters,
and get away with it maybe.

410
00:32:46,994 --> 00:32:50,156
- Wouldn't it be easier to file a claim?
- Easier but not so profitable.

411
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,428
An emissary from a big mining company
would be here soon...

412
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:56,561
with a paper in his hand
showing we had no right to be here.

413
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:01,506
How does it feel to be men of property?

414
00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:07,405
The tanks'll leak some at first...

415
00:33:07,481 --> 00:33:10,450
until the boards begin to swell
and close the seams.

416
00:33:12,687 --> 00:33:16,054
I sure had some cockeyed ideas
about prospecting for gold.

417
00:33:16,157 --> 00:33:18,387
It was all in the finding, I thought.

418
00:33:19,594 --> 00:33:22,687
I thought you just had to find it,
pick it up, put it in sacks...

419
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:24,663
and carry them off to the nearest bank.

420
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:27,826
You're learning. Pretty soon
I won't be able to tell you a thing.

421
00:33:27,902 --> 00:33:30,030
- Tank full yet?
- Right to the top.

422
00:33:30,105 --> 00:33:31,628
Open the sluice gate.

423
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:11,307
How much do you figure it to be now?

424
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:14,046
About $5,000 worth, I reckon.

425
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:18,819
When are we going to start dividing it up?

426
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:22,789
Anytime you say.

427
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,656
Why divide it at all? I don't see any point.

428
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:28,025
We're all going back together
when the time comes.

429
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:31,088
Why not wait till we get paid
and then divide the money?

430
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,362
Either way suits me. You fellows decide.

431
00:34:33,436 --> 00:34:35,870
I'm for dividing it up as we go along.

432
00:34:36,638 --> 00:34:39,368
Make each guy responsible
for his own goods.

433
00:34:39,674 --> 00:34:41,609
I'd just as soon have it that way.

434
00:34:41,677 --> 00:34:44,578
I don't like the responsibility
of guarding your treasure.

435
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:46,046
Who asked you to?

436
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:49,009
That's right. You never asked me.

437
00:34:49,084 --> 00:34:52,145
Only, I thought I was the most trustworthy
of the three.

438
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,346
You?

439
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:55,983
How come?

440
00:34:56,092 --> 00:35:00,085
I said the most trustworthy. As far as
being the most honest, no one can say.

441
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:02,628
I don't get you.

442
00:35:02,698 --> 00:35:05,166
Suppose you're charged
of taking care of the goods.

443
00:35:05,234 --> 00:35:08,693
One day I'm deep in the brush
and Curtin's on his way to get provisions.

444
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:11,706
That'd be your chance to pack up
and leave us in the cold.

445
00:35:11,774 --> 00:35:16,177
Only a guy that's a thief at heart would
think me likely to do a thing like that.

446
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,782
Right now, it wouldn't be
worth your while...

447
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:22,944
but when the pile's grown to 300 ounces,
think of such things you will.

448
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:25,444
How's about yourself?

449
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,882
I'm not quick on my feet any longer.

450
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,085
You're a lot tougher
than when we started out.

451
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,650
By the time the pile's grown
to be really tempting...

452
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:34,593
I won't be able to run half as fast as you.

453
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:36,860
You'd catch me
and string me up in no time.

454
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,334
That's why I think
I'm the most trustworthy.

455
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,598
Looking at it that way,
I guess you're right.

456
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,605
Maybe it'd be a good idea...

457
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:45,938
to cut the proceeds up
three ways every night.

458
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:48,443
It'll relieve you of a responsibility
you don't like.

459
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:49,706
Swell by me.

460
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,441
After we got a couple of hundred ounces...

461
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:53,983
it'll be a nuisance
carrying bags around our necks.

462
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:57,214
Each of us will have to hide his share
from the others.

463
00:35:57,287 --> 00:36:01,849
And after that, he'll have to be forever
on watch that his hiding place's not found.

464
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,257
What a dirty, filthy mind you've got.

465
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:08,221
Not dirty, baby.
Only I know what kind of ideas...

466
00:36:08,298 --> 00:36:11,268
even supposedly decent people get
when gold's at stake.

467
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,595
All right.

468
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,800
Here she goes three ways.

469
00:37:35,888 --> 00:37:37,048
Dobbs!

470
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:37,272
Howard, come quick!

471
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:47,116
He's coming around.

472
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:51,661
Lay still a minute
till you get your senses back.

473
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:53,863
What happened?

474
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:56,661
Part of the mine caved in on you.

475
00:39:03,577 --> 00:39:05,272
Got a knock on the head.

476
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:06,945
No bones broken?

477
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:09,480
I don't think so.

478
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,446
- Who pulled me out?
- Curtin did.

479
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:17,214
I owe my life to you, partner.

480
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:19,652
Forget it.

481
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:34,334
What'll you do
with your hard-earned money...

482
00:39:34,408 --> 00:39:36,137
when we get back and cash in?

483
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,009
I'm getting along in years.
I can still hold up my end...

484
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:42,277
when it comes to a hard day's work,
but I'm not the man I was once.

485
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:46,013
Next year, next month, next week,
by thunder, won't be the man I'm today.

486
00:39:46,087 --> 00:39:48,056
I think I'll settle down in a quiet place...

487
00:39:48,123 --> 00:39:50,523
get a little business, hardware,
grocery store...

488
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:53,856
spend the better part of my time
reading comics and adventure stories.

489
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:56,419
One thing's for sure.
I won't go prospecting again...

490
00:39:56,497 --> 00:39:59,058
wasting time and money
trying to find another gold mine.

491
00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:01,295
How about yourself?
What plans have you, if any?

492
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:04,429
I figure on buying some land
and growing fruit. Peaches, maybe.

493
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:06,838
How did you come to settle on peaches?

494
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:08,574
One summer, when I was a kid...

495
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:11,771
I worked as a picker in a peach harvest
in the San Joaquin Valley.

496
00:40:12,514 --> 00:40:14,414
Boy, it sure was something.

497
00:40:14,717 --> 00:40:16,684
Hundreds of people, old and young.

498
00:40:16,952 --> 00:40:18,943
Whole families working together.

499
00:40:19,154 --> 00:40:20,849
At night, after a day's work...

500
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:24,381
we used to build big bonfires
and sit around and sing to guitar music.

501
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:26,626
Till morning sometimes.

502
00:40:27,095 --> 00:40:30,724
We'd go to sleep, wake up and sing,
and go to sleep again.

503
00:40:31,566 --> 00:40:33,660
Everybody had a wonderful time.

504
00:40:34,771 --> 00:40:37,762
Ever since then I've had a hankering
to be a fruit grower.

505
00:40:37,873 --> 00:40:40,808
It must be grand
watching your own trees put on leaves...

506
00:40:40,876 --> 00:40:42,936
come into blossom and bear.

507
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:47,176
Watching the fruit get big
and ripe on the boughs, ready for picking.

508
00:40:49,184 --> 00:40:51,050
What's all that about?

509
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:54,279
We're telling each other
what we aim to do when we get back.

510
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,126
Now me, I got it all figured out
what I'm gonna do.

511
00:40:58,194 --> 00:41:00,162
Tell us about it, Dobbsie.

512
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:03,365
First off, I'm going to a Turkish bath
to sweat and soak...

513
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:06,596
till I get all the grime and dirt
out of my system.

514
00:41:07,136 --> 00:41:10,799
Then I'm going to a haberdasher and
gonna get myself a brand-new set of duds.

515
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:12,340
Dozen of everything.

516
00:41:12,642 --> 00:41:15,133
Then I'm going to a swell cafe...

517
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:18,910
order everything on the bill o' fare
and if it ain't just right...

518
00:41:18,982 --> 00:41:21,541
or maybe even if it is,
I'm gonna bawl the waiter out...

519
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:23,778
and make him take the whole thing back.

520
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,487
What's next on the program?

521
00:41:27,124 --> 00:41:28,887
Well, what would be?

522
00:41:39,036 --> 00:41:41,266
If I were you, I wouldn't talk
or think about women.

523
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:43,464
It ain't good for your health.

524
00:41:44,073 --> 00:41:47,771
Yeah, maybe you're right,
seeing how the prospects are far off.

525
00:41:47,845 --> 00:41:49,107
You know what?

526
00:41:49,246 --> 00:41:51,874
We ought to put a limit on our take,
agree between us...

527
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:54,144
when we get so much
we pull up stakes and beat it.

528
00:41:54,218 --> 00:41:57,585
- What do you think the limit ought to be?
- Say $25,000 worth apiece.

529
00:41:57,654 --> 00:42:00,248
$25,000, small potatoes.

530
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:01,883
How much do you say?

531
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:04,621
$50,000 anyway,
$75,000 would be more like it.

532
00:42:04,695 --> 00:42:07,960
That'd take a year if the vein held out,
which wouldn't be likely.

533
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:11,467
What's a year more or less
when that kind of money is to be had?

534
00:42:11,535 --> 00:42:14,061
$25,000 is plenty as far as I'm concerned.

535
00:42:14,138 --> 00:42:16,128
Enough to last me the rest of my lifetime.

536
00:42:16,206 --> 00:42:18,697
Well, sure, you're old, I'm young.

537
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:20,674
I need dough and plenty of it.

538
00:42:22,013 --> 00:42:23,412
$25,000 in one piece...

539
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:25,574
is more than I ever expected
to get my hands on.

540
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,741
Small potatoes.

541
00:42:26,817 --> 00:42:29,047
There's no use making hogs of ourselves.

542
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:31,717
Hog, am I?

543
00:42:31,856 --> 00:42:34,154
Maybe you don't know,
but I'd be within my rights...

544
00:42:34,225 --> 00:42:36,749
if I demanded half again
as much as you get.

545
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:37,851
How come?

546
00:42:37,928 --> 00:42:40,864
There's no denying I put up
the lion's share of the cash.

547
00:42:40,932 --> 00:42:44,095
So you did, Dobbsie,
and I always meant to pay you back.

548
00:42:44,168 --> 00:42:48,161
In any civilized place the biggest investor
gets the biggest return, don't he?

549
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,801
That's one thing in favor of the wilds.

550
00:42:51,075 --> 00:42:54,602
Not that I intended to demand it,
but I'd be within my rights if I did.

551
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:56,704
Next time you call me a hog
just remember...

552
00:42:56,781 --> 00:42:58,442
what I could've done if I'd wanted to.

553
00:42:58,516 --> 00:43:01,713
I think it'd be wise not to put things
strictly on a money basis.

554
00:43:01,786 --> 00:43:04,914
Here you are, Dobbs.
What I owe you with interest.

555
00:43:13,932 --> 00:43:16,629
I just don't like being called a hog,
that's all.

556
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:01,646
Don't scare me like that.
I might have let you have it.

557
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:03,239
Out for a midnight stroll?

558
00:44:03,316 --> 00:44:05,374
Tiger around,
I went to check on the burros.

559
00:44:05,451 --> 00:44:07,419
- So?
- What's the matter?

560
00:44:07,486 --> 00:44:11,321
- I think I'll see if the burros are all right.
- Go ahead. Help yourself.

561
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:28,066
- What's up?
- Nothing's up.

562
00:44:31,411 --> 00:44:32,742
Where is Dobbs?

563
00:44:32,812 --> 00:44:35,337
Poking around in the dark out there.

564
00:44:39,185 --> 00:44:41,278
He's sure taking a long time out there.

565
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:44,249
I think I'll go have a look-see.

566
00:45:07,148 --> 00:45:08,672
Where's Curtin?

567
00:45:09,616 --> 00:45:12,950
He's out there somewhere.
Said he was gonna have a look-see.

568
00:45:41,249 --> 00:45:43,079
It's my turn again but I won't take it...

569
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,778
if you won't stop worrying
about your goods and go to bed.

570
00:45:45,853 --> 00:45:47,650
We got work to do tomorrow.

571
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:03,836
Can't catch me sleeping.
Don't you ever believe that.

572
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:06,462
I'm not that dumb.

573
00:46:07,776 --> 00:46:09,801
The day you try to put anything
over on me...

574
00:46:09,878 --> 00:46:12,506
it'll be a costly one for both of you.

575
00:46:22,691 --> 00:46:26,525
Any more lip out of you
and I'll up and let you have it.

576
00:46:27,596 --> 00:46:32,431
If you know what's good for you, you
won't monkey around with Fred C. Dobbs.

577
00:46:36,172 --> 00:46:39,231
You ought to see Dobbs.
He's talking to himself a mile a minute.

578
00:46:39,307 --> 00:46:41,639
Something's eating him all right,
I don't know what.

579
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,736
He's just spoiling for trouble.

580
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:53,550
"We're running short of provisions,
Dobbsie.

581
00:46:53,623 --> 00:46:55,921
"How about you going to the village?"

582
00:46:56,425 --> 00:46:58,585
Who does Howard think he is,
ordering me around?

583
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,922
What's that, Dobbs?

584
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:01,327
- Nothing.
- Better look out.

585
00:47:01,397 --> 00:47:03,456
It's a bad sign when a guy talks to himself.

586
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:05,262
Yeah? Who else am I gonna talk to?

587
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:07,063
Certainly not you or Curtin.

588
00:47:07,136 --> 00:47:09,730
- Fine partners you two are.
- Got something up your nose?

589
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:11,273
Blow it out, it'll do you good.

590
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,968
Don't think you two
are putting anything over on me.

591
00:47:14,043 --> 00:47:16,102
- Take it easy.
- I know what your game is.

592
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:17,373
You know more than I do.

593
00:47:17,446 --> 00:47:20,643
Why am I elected to go to the village
instead of you or Curtin?

594
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:24,243
Don't think I don't see through that.
You two are together against me.

595
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,412
The two days I'd be gone...

596
00:47:25,488 --> 00:47:28,356
would give you lots of time
to discover where my goods are.

597
00:47:28,425 --> 00:47:29,756
If you fear along those lines...

598
00:47:29,827 --> 00:47:31,555
why don't you take your goods with you?

599
00:47:31,627 --> 00:47:34,494
And run the risk of having them
taken from me by bandits?

600
00:47:34,564 --> 00:47:36,829
If you run into them,
you'd be out of luck anyway.

601
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,164
They'd kill you for the shoes on your feet.

602
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:42,629
So that's it. Everything's clear now.

603
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:44,804
You're hoping bandits will get me.

604
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:47,399
That would save you a lot of trouble,
wouldn't it?

605
00:47:47,477 --> 00:47:50,173
And your consciences
wouldn't bother you none neither.

606
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:53,075
All right, Dobbs, forget about it.

607
00:48:22,213 --> 00:48:23,737
Just like I thought.

608
00:48:23,848 --> 00:48:26,008
- What's the idea?
- Put your hands up.

609
00:48:28,252 --> 00:48:31,416
I've a good mind to haul off
and pump you up, chest and belly alike.

610
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:33,548
Would you mind telling me
what this is about?

611
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:35,718
It won't get you anywhere playing dumb.

612
00:48:35,793 --> 00:48:37,020
Well, I'll be.

613
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:41,289
- So that's where your goods are hidden?
- Hey, what's the trouble here?

614
00:48:41,366 --> 00:48:43,960
Seems like I accidentally stumbled
on Dobbsie's treasure.

615
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:47,163
Accidentally? Why were you trying
to pry up that rock?

616
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:49,138
I saw a gila monster crawl under it.

617
00:48:49,207 --> 00:48:50,640
Brother, I got to hand it to you.

618
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:53,575
You can certainly pick up a good story
when you need one.

619
00:48:54,312 --> 00:48:57,748
Okay, I'm a liar.
There isn't a gila monster under there.

620
00:48:58,217 --> 00:49:00,878
Let's see you stick your hand in
and get your goods out.

621
00:49:00,952 --> 00:49:02,943
- Go ahead.
- Sure I will.

622
00:49:03,922 --> 00:49:05,048
But you try any bad moves...

623
00:49:05,123 --> 00:49:07,922
Don't worry. I'll stay right where I am.
I want to see this.

624
00:49:07,993 --> 00:49:09,755
Reach in and get your goods.

625
00:49:09,827 --> 00:49:12,660
If you don't, we'll think you're yellow,
won't we, Howard?

626
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:17,599
They never let go, do they, Howard,
once they grab onto you?

627
00:49:19,138 --> 00:49:22,903
You can cut them in two and the head
will still hang on till sundown, I hear.

628
00:49:22,974 --> 00:49:26,069
By that time the victim
doesn't usually care 'cause he's dead.

629
00:49:26,145 --> 00:49:28,136
- Isn't that right, Howard?
- I reckon.

630
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,548
Why don't you stick your hand in
and get your treasure?

631
00:49:31,616 --> 00:49:33,106
Couldn't be because you're scared...

632
00:49:33,184 --> 00:49:35,380
after the way you've been shooting
your mouth off?

633
00:49:35,454 --> 00:49:36,443
Show us you ain't yellow.

634
00:49:36,522 --> 00:49:39,389
I'd hate to think my partner
had a yellow streak up his back.

635
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,892
I'll kill you, you dirty, thieving...

636
00:49:43,896 --> 00:49:45,591
Okay, Howard, I got him covered.

637
00:49:45,664 --> 00:49:48,758
Another bad move out of you
and I'll blow you to kingdom come.

638
00:49:48,834 --> 00:49:51,530
Howard, turn that rock over, will you?

639
00:51:42,883 --> 00:51:44,783
The federales are very efficient.

640
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:49,185
Yeah. Bandidos, eh?

641
00:51:49,256 --> 00:51:51,782
Yeah, seems between them
they had a diamond ring...

642
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,293
pearl earrings, a lot of money
and a railway ticket...

643
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,921
with the date of the Aguascalientesile
train robbery on it.

644
00:51:56,997 --> 00:51:59,432
They've been here several days,
drinking, shooting...

645
00:51:59,501 --> 00:52:02,197
The villagers are afraid
to go out of their huts.

646
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:03,965
Where are they taking them now?

647
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:05,630
To the cemetery.

648
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:20,344
The federales
don't operate in our American way.

649
00:52:20,422 --> 00:52:23,789
They're not fingerprint experts,
but they can follow any trail.

650
00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:26,089
Against them, no hideout is any use.

651
00:52:26,161 --> 00:52:28,527
They know all the tricks of the bandits.

652
00:52:28,597 --> 00:52:31,191
You can bet your sweet soul
they'll trace down...

653
00:52:31,266 --> 00:52:34,167
every last one of that group
that attacked the train.

654
00:52:34,236 --> 00:52:37,364
It'll take time,
months maybe, but they'll do it.

655
00:52:42,511 --> 00:52:44,241
Not many Americans get around this way.

656
00:52:44,313 --> 00:52:46,474
You're the first
I've bumped into in a long time.

657
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:47,573
That so?

658
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:50,379
- Mighty rugged country hereabouts.
- Yeah.

659
00:52:51,286 --> 00:52:52,412
My name's Cody.

660
00:52:53,723 --> 00:52:54,849
I'm from Texas.

661
00:52:56,259 --> 00:52:58,227
- What's your game?
- I'm a hunter.

662
00:52:58,294 --> 00:53:00,318
- Professional?
- Yeah.

663
00:53:00,862 --> 00:53:02,091
What all do you hunt?

664
00:53:02,698 --> 00:53:05,258
Tiger cats, anything of commercial value.

665
00:53:06,335 --> 00:53:08,633
How long did you say
you'd been in these mountains?

666
00:53:08,704 --> 00:53:09,761
A few months.

667
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:12,774
Ever seen anything
that looked like pay dirt?

668
00:53:14,243 --> 00:53:17,542
I've a hunch there's loads of the real goods
up in those mountains.

669
00:53:18,414 --> 00:53:20,440
No, I know
the whole landscape around here.

670
00:53:20,516 --> 00:53:23,076
If there'd been gold,
you can bet I'd have seen it.

671
00:53:23,152 --> 00:53:25,052
There's nothing doing here for gold.

672
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:27,214
I can look at a hill five miles away...

673
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:29,759
and tell you if it carries
an ounce or a shipload.

674
00:53:30,861 --> 00:53:32,157
If you haven't found anything...

675
00:53:32,228 --> 00:53:33,957
I'll come with you, put your nose in it.

676
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:36,521
There's indications in the valley,
lots of indications.

677
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:38,932
By tracing the rocks,
I find they come from a ridge...

678
00:53:39,002 --> 00:53:40,594
washed down by the tropical rains.

679
00:53:40,671 --> 00:53:42,831
- You don't say so.
- Yes, I say so.

680
00:53:45,441 --> 00:53:46,966
So much for those bandits.

681
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:51,372
You gotta hand it to the Mexicans
when it comes to swift justice.

682
00:53:51,448 --> 00:53:53,642
Once the federales get their mitts
on a criminal...

683
00:53:53,716 --> 00:53:57,016
they know what to do.
They hand him a shovel, tell him to dig.

684
00:53:57,087 --> 00:53:58,213
When he's dug deep enough...

685
00:53:58,288 --> 00:54:01,917
they tell him to put the shovel down,
smoke a cigarette and say his prayers.

686
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:05,853
In another five minutes he's being covered
over with the earth he dug out.

687
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:08,794
Yeah, you gotta hand it to them all right.

688
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:24,144
I meant what I said about going along
with you. Those are my burros.

689
00:54:24,215 --> 00:54:27,581
I'm ready to start
if you'll let me go with you to your camp.

690
00:54:27,651 --> 00:54:30,142
Thanks anyway,
but I prefer going it by myself.

691
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:31,616
Good luck.

692
00:54:44,068 --> 00:54:47,697
I went way around, stayed on hard ground
which wouldn't show the tracks.

693
00:54:47,772 --> 00:54:51,435
Every time I hit a high point and looked
I'd see he was still following me.

694
00:54:51,509 --> 00:54:54,410
I guess it's only a matter of time
till he shows up here.

695
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:58,509
- I move we tell him straight off to beat it.
- Now, no, that'd be foolish.

696
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:02,349
He'd sit for an hour playing the innocent
and then report us to the officials.

697
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,878
Once they come, we can't stay
or take our goods with us if we left.

698
00:55:05,957 --> 00:55:08,825
There's nothing else to do
but kill him the minute he appears.

699
00:55:08,894 --> 00:55:10,417
No crime to visit these mountains.

700
00:55:10,495 --> 00:55:13,692
He may be a guy that likes to wander.
You can't shoot him for that.

701
00:55:13,765 --> 00:55:15,699
If you were to shoot him
it might come out.

702
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:17,633
We don't have to shoot him necessarily.

703
00:55:17,703 --> 00:55:20,728
We can push him off a rock
and claim it was an accident.

704
00:55:20,805 --> 00:55:22,773
Just who's gonna do the pushing, you?

705
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,000
We'll toss for it.

706
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:26,908
You're sure he was trailing you, are you?

707
00:55:27,012 --> 00:55:28,604
- Absolutely.
- How come?

708
00:55:28,681 --> 00:55:30,444
Because there he is.

709
00:55:47,733 --> 00:55:49,598
Come over by the fire.

710
00:55:59,678 --> 00:56:02,169
I know quite well,
you fellas, I'm not wanted here.

711
00:56:02,248 --> 00:56:03,510
Even after what you told me...

712
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,517
I couldn't resist the desire
to sit and jaw with an American.

713
00:56:06,585 --> 00:56:09,213
Why don't you go where Americans
want to talk to you?

714
00:56:09,288 --> 00:56:10,448
Durango isn't too far off.

715
00:56:10,522 --> 00:56:13,321
They got one
of them American clubs there.

716
00:56:13,693 --> 00:56:15,216
I'm not after that.

717
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:18,353
I've got other things on my mind,
more important.

718
00:56:19,798 --> 00:56:21,699
So do we. Don't make any mistakes.

719
00:56:21,768 --> 00:56:23,599
Our biggest worry is your presence here.

720
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:24,830
We got no use for you.

721
00:56:25,004 --> 00:56:27,631
We don't even want you
for a cook or a dishwasher.

722
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:29,465
No vacancies, understand?

723
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,677
In case I don't make myself clear,
you'll be doing yourself a favor...

724
00:56:33,747 --> 00:56:35,942
packing up and getting out
tomorrow morning.

725
00:56:36,015 --> 00:56:39,178
Go back where you came from.
Take our blessings with you.

726
00:56:40,754 --> 00:56:41,743
Thanks.

727
00:56:42,522 --> 00:56:46,219
Go ahead. Help yourself. We're no misers.
We don't let guys starve to death.

728
00:56:47,495 --> 00:56:48,927
Tonight, you're our guest.

729
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,754
But tomorrow morning...

730
00:56:51,831 --> 00:56:55,028
Iook out, no trespassing around here,
you know?

731
00:56:55,235 --> 00:56:56,794
"Beware of the dogs." Get it?

732
00:57:01,941 --> 00:57:05,308
I got myself five foxes and a lion
while you were away at the village.

733
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:07,570
- How are the hides?
- Pretty good.

734
00:57:07,848 --> 00:57:10,475
- Where'd you hit them?
- Right through their eyes.

735
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:13,781
Excuse me for butting in, but there's
no game here worth going after.

736
00:57:13,853 --> 00:57:15,549
It wouldn't take a week for a hunter...

737
00:57:15,623 --> 00:57:18,387
to clean up all around
for five miles in each direction.

738
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:22,289
Yes, there's no good hunting here.

739
00:57:22,362 --> 00:57:24,160
That's why we made up our mind
to leave...

740
00:57:24,231 --> 00:57:26,199
so that we could look
for something better.

741
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:28,758
Yes, stranger, you're dead right.
Awful poor ground.

742
00:57:28,836 --> 00:57:30,463
It took us some time to find it out.

743
00:57:30,538 --> 00:57:32,004
Poor ground, you say?

744
00:57:32,205 --> 00:57:34,037
Depends on what you're looking for.

745
00:57:34,642 --> 00:57:35,631
For game, yes.

746
00:57:36,177 --> 00:57:38,338
Mighty good ground for something else.

747
00:57:39,613 --> 00:57:40,978
What might that be?

748
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:42,738
Gold.

749
00:57:49,323 --> 00:57:50,518
That's a good one.

750
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,060
I told you in the village,
there's no gold around here.

751
00:57:53,128 --> 00:57:56,426
If there was one single ounce of it,
I'd have seen it, believe me.

752
00:57:56,497 --> 00:58:00,400
If you haven't found any gold here,
you're not as smart as you appear to be.

753
00:58:00,469 --> 00:58:02,733
Well, maybe, you're right.

754
00:58:03,038 --> 00:58:04,027
Who knows?

755
00:58:05,673 --> 00:58:08,198
We never thought about gold.
Gives me an idea.

756
00:58:08,977 --> 00:58:10,342
Guess I'll sleep on it.

757
00:58:11,012 --> 00:58:12,445
I'll hit the hay.

758
00:58:13,315 --> 00:58:14,304
Yeah. Me, too.

759
00:58:14,983 --> 00:58:16,506
See you in the morning, mister.

760
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,233
I can't figure this bird out.
Is he wise to us or not?

761
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,897
Whether he is or not,
he looks fairly harmless to me.

762
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:41,138
- Looks can be mighty deceiving.
- No denying that.

763
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,505
I'm keeping my boots on this night.

764
00:58:46,582 --> 00:58:49,015
Might take it in his head
to murder us in our sleep.

765
00:58:49,084 --> 00:58:52,281
- Anything can happen. I'll tell you what.
- Well, then?

766
00:58:52,354 --> 00:58:55,188
You guys go to sleep
and I'll be watchdog for a few hours.

767
00:58:55,258 --> 00:58:56,782
Then you both can take your turns.

768
00:58:56,859 --> 00:58:59,258
- Okay. Got your gun handy?
- Yeah. Right here.

769
00:59:29,927 --> 00:59:31,189
Good morning, friend.

770
00:59:33,462 --> 00:59:35,362
Where'd you get the water
to make coffee?

771
00:59:35,431 --> 00:59:37,695
- I took it out of the olla.
- You did, did you?

772
00:59:37,767 --> 00:59:40,293
We didn't carry that water here
for you to make coffee.

773
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:43,634
- I didn't know water was so hard to get.
- You know it now.

774
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:45,264
I'll fill it up for you.

775
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:46,500
What's up?

776
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:48,811
I caught this guy stealing our water.

777
00:59:49,112 --> 00:59:52,309
The next time I'll let it out of you
through two little round holes.

778
00:59:52,382 --> 00:59:55,942
I thought I was among civilized men
who wouldn't begrudge me fresh water.

779
00:59:56,018 --> 00:59:57,611
Who's not civilized?

780
01:00:04,827 --> 01:00:06,887
I could easily do the same for you.

781
01:00:06,964 --> 01:00:09,194
It's not settled yet who'd come out on top.

782
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:11,095
This time I took it.

783
01:00:11,435 --> 01:00:12,868
Thanks for your kind attention.

784
01:00:12,936 --> 01:00:16,235
If I was you, stranger,
I'd pack up and go while the going's good.

785
01:00:16,506 --> 01:00:17,939
I mean to stay right here.

786
01:00:18,008 --> 01:00:20,203
The brush and the mountains are free,
aren't they?

787
01:00:20,277 --> 01:00:22,871
Sure. That's right,
whoever's first on the spot.

788
01:00:22,946 --> 01:00:25,074
That holds for hunters,
but not for gold miners.

789
01:00:25,149 --> 01:00:27,673
Unless they have happened
to have registered their claim.

790
01:00:27,751 --> 01:00:29,343
Who says we have a claim to register?

791
01:00:29,419 --> 01:00:32,947
Whatever you say or don't say,
tomorrow I start to dig for gold here.

792
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,830
I know you guys
can bump me off any minute...

793
01:00:44,899 --> 01:00:47,629
but that's a risk worth running
considering the stakes.

794
01:00:47,702 --> 01:00:49,396
Let's lay all our cards on the table.

795
01:00:49,469 --> 01:00:52,030
As I see it, you guys have to do
one of three things:

796
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:55,303
Kill me, run me off
or take me in with you as a partner.

797
01:00:55,376 --> 01:00:57,344
Let's consider the first.

798
01:00:57,411 --> 01:01:00,608
Another guy may come along tomorrow.
Maybe a dozen other guys.

799
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:01,807
If you start killing them...

800
01:01:01,882 --> 01:01:04,407
how far are you prepared to go?
Ask yourselves that.

801
01:01:04,485 --> 01:01:07,852
Also, don't forget,
the one actually to do the bumping off...

802
01:01:07,922 --> 01:01:10,390
would forever be in the power
of the other two.

803
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,689
The only safe way would be
for all of you to drag out your cannons...

804
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:16,195
and bang away at the same instant
like a firing squad.

805
01:01:16,263 --> 01:01:18,858
We wouldn't stop at anything
to protect our interests.

806
01:01:18,934 --> 01:01:20,458
I claim killing me isn't it.

807
01:01:21,802 --> 01:01:23,929
But, of course, that's for you to decide.

808
01:01:24,939 --> 01:01:26,304
As for choice number two...

809
01:01:26,374 --> 01:01:28,502
you run me off,
I might very well inform on you.

810
01:01:28,577 --> 01:01:30,374
We'd get you if you did that.

811
01:01:30,545 --> 01:01:33,172
We'd get you
if we had to go all the way to China.

812
01:01:33,247 --> 01:01:36,445
Of your find is the reward I'd get.

813
01:01:36,518 --> 01:01:38,418
And that would be mighty tempting.

814
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,445
It's a strong argument
in favor of number one.

815
01:01:41,523 --> 01:01:42,989
I don't deny it.

816
01:01:43,057 --> 01:01:45,025
But let's see
what number three has to offer.

817
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:48,228
If you take me in as a partner,
you don't stand to lose anything.

818
01:01:48,463 --> 01:01:52,160
I'll not ask a share in what you've made
so far, only in the profits to come.

819
01:01:53,701 --> 01:01:55,135
What do you say?

820
01:01:57,506 --> 01:02:00,475
Mind, stranger, letting us talk this over
among ourselves?

821
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:01,804
Not at all. Go ahead.

822
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,002
I have to look after my burros anyway.

823
01:02:18,727 --> 01:02:21,424
- What do you think?
- Sending him away is out of the question.

824
01:02:21,497 --> 01:02:23,761
Either we bump him off
or make him a partner.

825
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,528
F.C. Dobbs ain't a guy
that likes being taken advantage of.

826
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,301
Do the mug in, I say.

827
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:29,901
He told us how, didn't he?

828
01:02:29,971 --> 01:02:32,270
All of us hold out our cannons
and let him have it.

829
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:34,036
What do we gain by bumping him off?

830
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,601
If he was asking to share in what we made
it'd be different.

831
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:38,441
I don't mind being taken advantage of...

832
01:02:38,513 --> 01:02:40,414
if it isn't money out of my pocket.

833
01:02:40,483 --> 01:02:41,950
And whoever else comes along...

834
01:02:42,018 --> 01:02:44,816
they're to be invited in, too.
Come one, come all?

835
01:02:44,987 --> 01:02:47,649
You got a point there.
No question about that.

836
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:49,782
But killing...

837
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:53,226
- What's the matter, ain't you up to it?
- Sure, I'm up to it.

838
01:02:56,165 --> 01:02:57,633
Let the majority decide.

839
01:02:59,535 --> 01:03:01,002
What's your vote, partner?

840
01:03:01,337 --> 01:03:02,634
For or against?

841
01:03:08,111 --> 01:03:09,100
For.

842
01:03:12,148 --> 01:03:14,173
Let's make it short and sweet for him.

843
01:03:52,724 --> 01:03:54,714
So it's number one, is it?

844
01:03:54,992 --> 01:03:57,119
Better take a look down that hill first.

845
01:04:08,839 --> 01:04:11,536
I can't make out what they are.
They must be soldiers.

846
01:04:11,609 --> 01:04:13,406
So that's your stinking game, is it?

847
01:04:13,478 --> 01:04:16,605
Informing. I knew you were an informer.
I knew it all the time.

848
01:04:16,713 --> 01:04:19,046
You're wrong, brother.
This means all our funerals.

849
01:04:19,117 --> 01:04:20,311
What's that?

850
01:04:20,385 --> 01:04:22,751
If it's what I think it is,
may the Lord be with us.

851
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:26,619
They're not soldiers, they're bandits.
After guns and ammunition, not gold.

852
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:29,455
Some villager must have told them
about the American hunter.

853
01:04:29,527 --> 01:04:32,894
They don't look like soldiers to me, either.
They are bandits.

854
01:04:32,964 --> 01:04:35,524
We better start thinking
of a way to defend ourselves.

855
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,001
We can hide in the rocks but
we'll lose the burros and the whole outfit.

856
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:40,867
The best thing is to fight.

857
01:04:40,939 --> 01:04:43,305
You have good eyes.
Stay here on this lookout...

858
01:04:43,374 --> 01:04:45,467
for the time being
and watch their movements.

859
01:04:45,543 --> 01:04:48,068
You herd all the burros
in that thicket there.

860
01:04:48,146 --> 01:04:51,809
Dobbs, we'll wrap up all our belongings
and dump them in the trench.

861
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,585
They're turning onto the trail.

862
01:05:31,658 --> 01:05:33,784
- How many of them are there?
- About a dozen.

863
01:05:33,859 --> 01:05:36,794
They'll be an hour getting here
so we better eat something.

864
01:05:37,129 --> 01:05:38,687
Come on down, friend.

865
01:06:39,402 --> 01:06:39,402
next sub

866
01:06:39,402 --> 01:06:41,893
Look, Howard.
The one in the gold hat, remember?

867
01:06:41,971 --> 01:06:43,963
Yeah, the man in the train robbery.

868
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,372
They'll think whoever was here is gone.

869
01:06:50,914 --> 01:06:53,440
Some want to go back down
the mountains, others want to stay...

870
01:06:53,517 --> 01:06:56,247
and use this site as headquarters
to raid the villages.

871
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,617
How about pouring it into them?

872
01:06:57,688 --> 01:07:01,180
- Bumping off as many as we can, real fast?
- No, let's hold our horses.

873
01:07:21,213 --> 01:07:22,475
We are federales.

874
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:25,109
You know, the mounted police.

875
01:07:25,484 --> 01:07:27,815
If you are the police,
where are your badges?

876
01:07:27,885 --> 01:07:30,719
Badges? We ain't got no badges.

877
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:33,486
We don't need no badges.

878
01:07:33,558 --> 01:07:36,026
I don't have to show you
any stinking badges.

879
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:38,188
Better not come any closer.

880
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:43,258
We didn't try to do you any harm.

881
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:45,866
Why don't you try to be
a little more polite?

882
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:49,097
Give us your gun
and we'll leave you in peace.

883
01:07:49,575 --> 01:07:51,440
I need my gun myself.

884
01:07:53,044 --> 01:07:55,172
Throw that old iron over here.

885
01:07:55,248 --> 01:07:57,546
We'll pick it up and go on our way.

886
01:07:57,617 --> 01:08:00,552
You go anyway without my gun,
and go quick.

887
01:08:03,055 --> 01:08:05,388
All right.

888
01:08:28,916 --> 01:08:32,080
Look here, amigo, you got the wrong idea.

889
01:08:32,653 --> 01:08:35,884
We don't want to get your gun
for nothing. We want to buy it.

890
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:40,458
Look, I have a gold watch
with a gold chain...

891
01:08:40,962 --> 01:08:42,520
made in your own country.

892
01:08:42,764 --> 01:08:46,927
The watch and the chain,
they're worth at least 200 pesos.

893
01:08:47,568 --> 01:08:49,229
I'll change it for your gun.

894
01:08:50,305 --> 01:08:53,103
You better take it.
That's a good business for you.

895
01:08:53,308 --> 01:08:55,333
You keep your watch, I'll keep my gun.

896
01:08:55,777 --> 01:08:59,577
Oh, you'll keep it? You will keep it?
We won't get it?

897
01:08:59,814 --> 01:09:00,872
I'll show you.

898
01:10:22,566 --> 01:10:24,090
Anybody get hurt?

899
01:10:25,603 --> 01:10:27,195
Looks like we won that round.

900
01:10:28,005 --> 01:10:31,908
- That guy with the gold hat, ain't he...
- We spotted him, too. The train robber.

901
01:10:32,077 --> 01:10:34,510
- Maybe they got enough?
- I doubt it.

902
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:37,980
Since they know there's four guns,
they'll be more determined than ever.

903
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:42,146
- What do you suppose they'll pull next?
- No telling. All we can do is sit tight.

904
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:46,119
Cody, are you all right?

905
01:11:36,276 --> 01:11:37,368
He's dead.

906
01:11:39,112 --> 01:11:41,104
Got it right through the neck.

907
01:11:42,449 --> 01:11:43,609
One less gun.

908
01:11:48,622 --> 01:11:50,887
Chopping wood for camp, that's funny.

909
01:11:51,893 --> 01:11:54,360
If they're up to what I think they are,
it ain't funny.

910
01:11:54,428 --> 01:11:56,623
- What's that?
- They're building moving barricades.

911
01:11:56,697 --> 01:11:57,891
An old Indian trick.

912
01:11:57,965 --> 01:12:01,094
They crawl and push the barricades.
You can't see where to shoot.

913
01:12:01,169 --> 01:12:05,571
I'd be willing to trade my share of the
mine right now for a few hand grenades.

914
01:12:05,672 --> 01:12:07,663
You'd better get to your posts.

915
01:12:31,033 --> 01:12:32,966
They're beating it.

916
01:12:40,509 --> 01:12:43,376
- What do you make of that?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

917
01:12:44,214 --> 01:12:46,613
Wait a minute,
this may be some trick to lure us out.

918
01:12:46,682 --> 01:12:50,243
I don't think so. They ain't
good enough actors for this kind of a trick.

919
01:13:07,237 --> 01:13:09,603
Hey, partner. Up here.

920
01:13:09,739 --> 01:13:12,230
Here's a sight if there ever was one.

921
01:13:23,688 --> 01:13:27,145
Federales. Look at them.
I could kiss every one of them.

922
01:13:27,224 --> 01:13:30,752
They must've gotten it from the villagers
there were bandits headed here.

923
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:32,819
Why don't they wait here,
make a fight of it?

924
01:13:32,897 --> 01:13:34,455
They know all the tricks that's why.

925
01:13:34,532 --> 01:13:37,899
With us behind and the federales facing
them, they wouldn't have a chance.

926
01:13:37,969 --> 01:13:39,664
Go get them, sick them, tie them.

927
01:13:39,737 --> 01:13:42,763
Chew them up and don't spit them out.
Swallow them.

928
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,829
Am I happy.

929
01:13:43,908 --> 01:13:46,672
Tell you the truth,
I was already eating dirt.

930
01:13:48,347 --> 01:13:50,076
I wonder who he is.

931
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:54,145
And if he's got any folks.

932
01:13:54,218 --> 01:13:55,480
Supposing he has?

933
01:13:55,553 --> 01:13:57,613
Let's take a look at his belongings.

934
01:14:19,278 --> 01:14:20,677
A few hundred pesos.

935
01:14:21,914 --> 01:14:24,850
Name's James Cody. Dallas, Texas.

936
01:14:26,286 --> 01:14:29,016
A letter from Dallas, too.
It must be his home.

937
01:14:29,789 --> 01:14:31,416
Reckon she's his girl.

938
01:14:33,526 --> 01:14:34,754
Not bad.

939
01:14:36,596 --> 01:14:39,394
"Dear Jim: Your letter just arrived.

940
01:14:39,699 --> 01:14:43,693
"It was such a relief to get word
after so many months of...

941
01:14:45,139 --> 01:14:46,127
"silence.

942
01:14:47,173 --> 01:14:49,903
"I realize, of course, that...

943
01:14:50,243 --> 01:14:55,045
"there aren't any mailboxes
that you can drop a letter in...

944
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:58,384
"out there in the wild."

945
01:14:58,818 --> 01:15:00,252
You better read it.

946
01:15:00,921 --> 01:15:03,788
"But that doesn't keep me
from worrying about you.

947
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:09,688
"Little Jimmy is fine, but he misses
his daddy almost as much as I do.

948
01:15:10,031 --> 01:15:12,658
"He keeps asking,
'When's Daddy coming home? '

949
01:15:13,567 --> 01:15:16,468
"You say if you do not make
a real find this time...

950
01:15:16,537 --> 01:15:18,062
"you'll never go again.

951
01:15:18,573 --> 01:15:21,838
"I cannot begin to tell you
how my heart rejoices...

952
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:24,776
"at those words, if you really mean them.

953
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:27,948
"Now I feel free to tell you...

954
01:15:28,183 --> 01:15:30,879
"I've never thought
any material treasure...

955
01:15:31,453 --> 01:15:35,823
"no matter how great, is worth the pain
of these long separations.

956
01:15:37,727 --> 01:15:40,786
"The country is especially lovely this year.

957
01:15:41,396 --> 01:15:44,730
"It's been a perfect spring.
Warm rains and hardly any frost.

958
01:15:45,368 --> 01:15:47,563
"The fruit trees are all in bloom.

959
01:15:48,237 --> 01:15:50,467
"The upper orchard looks aflame...

960
01:15:50,673 --> 01:15:53,266
"and the lower, like after a snowstorm.

961
01:15:54,076 --> 01:15:56,101
"Everybody looks forward to big crops.

962
01:15:56,846 --> 01:15:59,007
"I do hope you are back for the harvest.

963
01:16:03,153 --> 01:16:06,713
"Of course, I'm hoping
that you will at last strike it rich.

964
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:08,747
"It is high time for luck...

965
01:16:09,158 --> 01:16:11,023
"to start smiling upon you.

966
01:16:11,595 --> 01:16:13,426
"But just in case she doesn't...

967
01:16:13,864 --> 01:16:16,856
"remember we've already found
life's real treasures.

968
01:16:17,467 --> 01:16:19,627
"Forever yours, Helen."

969
01:16:24,374 --> 01:16:26,638
I guess we better dig a hole for him.

970
01:16:37,754 --> 01:16:40,246
- Yeah, not so good.
- Not so good as yesterday.

971
01:16:40,325 --> 01:16:42,725
Want my opinion?
Lt'll be a lot less from now on.

972
01:16:42,794 --> 01:16:44,625
We've taken
all the gold this mountain has.

973
01:16:44,696 --> 01:16:46,424
How much do you figure we got today?

974
01:16:46,496 --> 01:16:49,557
Not as much as we were aiming to collect.
Not $40,000.

975
01:16:49,634 --> 01:16:51,329
I'm willing to lower my hindsight.

976
01:16:51,402 --> 01:16:55,270
We've got upwards of $35,000 apiece.
I tell you, we ought to be plenty thankful.

977
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:57,138
Let's call it quits and pack up and leave.

978
01:16:57,209 --> 01:16:59,267
The sooner the better
as far as I'm concerned.

979
01:16:59,344 --> 01:17:01,141
I don't want to keep that dame waiting.

980
01:17:01,212 --> 01:17:04,340
It'll take a week to break the mine,
put the mountain back in shape.

981
01:17:04,415 --> 01:17:05,439
Do what to the mountain?

982
01:17:05,516 --> 01:17:07,542
Make her look like
she was before we came.

983
01:17:07,619 --> 01:17:08,711
I don't get it.

984
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:11,312
We wounded this place.
It's our duty to close her wounds.

985
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:14,985
The least we can do to show our gratitude
for all the wealth she's given us.

986
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:17,620
If you guys don't want to help me,
I'll do it alone.

987
01:17:18,197 --> 01:17:20,927
You talk about that mountain
like it was a real woman.

988
01:17:21,734 --> 01:17:24,533
She's been a lot better to me
than any woman I ever knew.

989
01:17:24,604 --> 01:17:27,504
Keep your shirt on, old-timer.
Sure, I'll help you.

990
01:18:06,613 --> 01:18:08,308
I reckon that's about everything.

991
01:18:08,381 --> 01:18:11,510
Each man's burros with his goods
will be his own responsibility.

992
01:18:11,585 --> 01:18:12,574
Come on.

993
01:18:14,455 --> 01:18:16,252
Goodbye, mountain, and thanks.

994
01:18:18,225 --> 01:18:20,716
Yeah, thanks, mountain.

995
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:48,484
I've been thinking about her.

996
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:51,057
Cody's widow, I mean, and the kid.

997
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:52,816
You know what?

998
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:56,763
We ought to give them a fourth just
as if he'd been our partner from the start.

999
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:58,663
What? A fourth of all our goods?

1000
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:01,027
- That's right.
- Are you crazy?

1001
01:19:01,102 --> 01:19:04,300
If not for him, we wouldn't have
walked away from that mountain.

1002
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:05,362
Ask Howard.

1003
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:07,805
The buzzard would have gotten fat
on us all right.

1004
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:10,471
Yeah, it might just as well have been
one of us.

1005
01:19:10,546 --> 01:19:13,014
But it wasn't.
It's our good luck and his bad.

1006
01:19:13,716 --> 01:19:16,116
Whatever you guys do,
I'm going to give a fourth.

1007
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:19,746
I got more than I need, anyhow.
Half what I got is enough to last me out.

1008
01:19:19,856 --> 01:19:21,256
- Fourth?
- Sure.

1009
01:19:21,358 --> 01:19:24,418
You two guys must have been born
in a revival meeting.

1010
01:19:33,837 --> 01:19:35,304
We got company.

1011
01:19:39,343 --> 01:19:40,742
Steady, boys.

1012
01:20:13,444 --> 01:20:14,536
Coffee.

1013
01:20:19,684 --> 01:20:21,049
Give him some tobacco.

1014
01:20:36,068 --> 01:20:39,265
We give them our tobacco,
they give us theirs, I don't get it.

1015
01:20:39,338 --> 01:20:41,499
Why not everybody smoke his own?

1016
01:20:42,074 --> 01:20:43,940
Take some and thank them.

1017
01:20:49,582 --> 01:20:51,346
They're after something.

1018
01:20:52,185 --> 01:20:54,380
Takes them a while to come to the point.

1019
01:20:54,721 --> 01:20:58,417
To say what you want right off the bat
isn't considered polite among Indians.

1020
01:21:29,156 --> 01:21:31,181
They got nothing but time?

1021
01:22:02,491 --> 01:22:05,324
His boy fell in the water,
they fished him out.

1022
01:22:05,394 --> 01:22:08,192
- He ain't dead, but he just won't come to.
- Tough.

1023
01:22:09,598 --> 01:22:11,293
I'll go have a look at the boy.

1024
01:22:11,366 --> 01:22:14,427
I'll be back in a little while.
Before morning, probably.

1025
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:25,209
Look after my goods while I am gone.

1026
01:23:10,829 --> 01:23:11,817
Tequila.

1027
01:25:42,252 --> 01:25:45,346
Artificial respiration did it
and a few Boy Scout tricks.

1028
01:25:45,421 --> 01:25:47,616
I think it was more shock than drowning.

1029
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:51,285
He hadn't swallowed much water.
Maybe he was stunned while diving.

1030
01:25:51,427 --> 01:25:54,760
How did these Indians know we were
in this neck of the woods anyhow?

1031
01:25:54,831 --> 01:25:58,893
When you're near their villages,
don't ask me how, they just know.

1032
01:26:28,633 --> 01:26:29,759
What's up?

1033
01:26:29,834 --> 01:26:32,563
He's insisting we return to his village
and be his guests.

1034
01:26:32,636 --> 01:26:35,435
Tell him to forget it.
Tell him he don't owe us a thing.

1035
01:26:46,584 --> 01:26:49,417
If he doesn't pay off his debt
all the saints will be angry.

1036
01:26:49,487 --> 01:26:51,011
This is no laughing matter.

1037
01:26:51,089 --> 01:26:54,856
I'm afraid he's determined
to take us with him, even if it means force.

1038
01:26:54,927 --> 01:26:56,394
I'll handle this.

1039
01:27:02,034 --> 01:27:05,663
Wait a minute. You can't fight your way
out of this. Put your guns away.

1040
01:27:05,738 --> 01:27:09,606
Have every Indian in the mountain on
our trail. We'd be scalped in half an hour.

1041
01:27:18,884 --> 01:27:20,375
What'd he say then?

1042
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,648
It didn't make any difference
about you guys but I have to come.

1043
01:27:23,724 --> 01:27:26,089
- It's like that, he just wants you.
- Looks like it.

1044
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:27,625
Why don't you go with them?

1045
01:27:27,693 --> 01:27:30,788
Stay a few days and we'll meet you
in Durango. We'll wait there.

1046
01:27:30,864 --> 01:27:33,424
- What about my goods?
- Why don't you take them with you.

1047
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:37,333
If they found out they might forget he was
their honored guest and bump him off.

1048
01:27:37,404 --> 01:27:39,395
What'll I do? Dump them on the ground?

1049
01:27:39,473 --> 01:27:43,273
We'll take them with us if you want us to
and wait for you in Durango.

1050
01:27:45,112 --> 01:27:47,308
I reckon that's about the only solution.

1051
01:27:47,382 --> 01:27:51,181
I bet you'll remember this
the next time you try to do a good deed.

1052
01:27:51,651 --> 01:27:54,711
Maybe after I've stayed with them
they'll give me a horse.

1053
01:27:54,788 --> 01:27:56,723
Then I'll be a day or two behind you.

1054
01:27:56,791 --> 01:27:58,782
That'll be swell. Good luck, Howard.

1055
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:01,260
Yeah, all the luck in the world.

1056
01:28:01,462 --> 01:28:05,455
We'll be lonesome without you. But
my Sunday school teacher used to say:

1057
01:28:06,034 --> 01:28:09,401
"You got to learn to swallow
disappointments in this sad life."

1058
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:10,698
Hurry up and join us.

1059
01:28:10,772 --> 01:28:13,901
Look out for those Indian dames.
They tell me they're smart.

1060
01:28:13,976 --> 01:28:16,137
One of them squaws might marry you.

1061
01:28:16,678 --> 01:28:20,113
Maybe I'll do just that. Pick out
a good-looking squaw and marry her.

1062
01:28:20,181 --> 01:28:23,640
They're easy to dress, feed and entertain.
They don't nag at you, either.

1063
01:28:23,719 --> 01:28:25,209
So long, partners.

1064
01:28:27,222 --> 01:28:28,883
See you in Durango.

1065
01:29:28,219 --> 01:29:30,847
Ain't it always his burros
that won't march in line...

1066
01:29:30,921 --> 01:29:34,790
stray off the trail and smash their packs
against the trees and rocks?

1067
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:39,720
I wish they'd stray off far enough
to fall down about 2,000 feet of gorge.

1068
01:29:40,264 --> 01:29:42,562
Why'd you offer
to carry his goods for him?

1069
01:29:42,633 --> 01:29:44,534
As if he couldn't manage by himself.

1070
01:29:44,603 --> 01:29:47,197
He knew what he was doing
when he turned them over to us.

1071
01:29:47,272 --> 01:29:49,206
Mighty cute of him, wasn't it?

1072
01:29:50,008 --> 01:29:53,341
What's the use of railing against
the old man? It won't do any good.

1073
01:29:53,411 --> 01:29:56,278
Save your breath
for the next piece of trail.

1074
01:29:56,515 --> 01:29:58,676
I'm stopping here for the night.

1075
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:02,150
If you want to go on it's okay with me,
but take his burros with you.

1076
01:30:02,221 --> 01:30:03,744
They ain't my responsibility.

1077
01:30:03,822 --> 01:30:06,416
It's early. We can make four,
five miles more before dark.

1078
01:30:06,491 --> 01:30:10,450
Nobody ordered you to stay here.
You can go 20 miles more for all I care.

1079
01:30:11,631 --> 01:30:12,962
Ordered me?

1080
01:30:14,267 --> 01:30:15,325
You?

1081
01:30:16,936 --> 01:30:19,096
Who's ordering who to do anything?

1082
01:30:19,571 --> 01:30:22,097
You talk like you're boss of this outfit.

1083
01:30:24,343 --> 01:30:26,868
Maybe you are, let's hear you say it.

1084
01:30:29,683 --> 01:30:31,741
All right, if you can't go any further.

1085
01:30:31,817 --> 01:30:33,682
Who says I can't? Don't make me laugh.

1086
01:30:33,753 --> 01:30:35,983
I can go four times
as far as a mug like you.

1087
01:30:36,055 --> 01:30:39,651
But I don't want to. I could if I want to,
but I don't want to, see, mug?

1088
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:44,860
What's the use of hollering?

1089
01:30:44,931 --> 01:30:48,265
We're started on something
and we've got to finish it, like it or not.

1090
01:30:48,335 --> 01:30:49,927
We'll camp here.

1091
01:30:57,244 --> 01:30:59,337
Wonder what the old man's doing now.

1092
01:30:59,413 --> 01:31:03,281
Eating a meal of roast turkey
and drinking a bottle of tequila probably.

1093
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:06,047
This is the first day we've had
to manage without his help.

1094
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,486
Once we get the hang of it, it'll be easier.

1095
01:31:08,556 --> 01:31:10,887
How far away
do you suppose the railroad is?

1096
01:31:10,958 --> 01:31:13,722
- Not so far as the crow flies.
- We ain't crows.

1097
01:31:14,896 --> 01:31:17,660
I figure we can reach the high-pass
in two days more...

1098
01:31:17,732 --> 01:31:20,200
then it'll be three or four days
to the railroad.

1099
01:31:20,268 --> 01:31:23,261
That's figuring no hard luck
on the trail, of course.

1100
01:31:27,075 --> 01:31:28,770
What's the joke, Dobbsie?

1101
01:31:30,545 --> 01:31:32,446
Aren't you going to let me in on it?

1102
01:31:32,514 --> 01:31:34,982
In on it? Sure I will.

1103
01:31:35,584 --> 01:31:36,676
Sure.

1104
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,355
Go ahead, spill it. What's so funny?

1105
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:44,459
I was thinking what a bonehead play
that old jackass made...

1106
01:31:44,526 --> 01:31:48,053
- when he put all his goods in our keeping.
- What do you mean?

1107
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:51,031
Figured he'd let us do his sweating
for him, did he?

1108
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,930
- We'll show him.
- What are you getting at?

1109
01:31:55,037 --> 01:31:57,005
Can't you see? It's all ours.

1110
01:31:57,072 --> 01:32:00,167
We don't go back to Durango at all.
Not at all.

1111
01:32:01,011 --> 01:32:02,273
I don't follow you.

1112
01:32:02,345 --> 01:32:04,904
Don't be such a sap.
Where did you ever grow up?

1113
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:07,608
All right, to make it clear
to a dumbhead like you...

1114
01:32:07,683 --> 01:32:11,313
we take all his goods and go straight
up north and leave the jackass flat.

1115
01:32:11,388 --> 01:32:14,789
You aren't serious, are you? You don't
really mean what you are saying.

1116
01:32:14,858 --> 01:32:17,827
Fred C. Dobbs don't say nothing
he don't mean.

1117
01:32:20,597 --> 01:32:25,125
As long as I'm here and can do anything,
you won't touch the old man's goods.

1118
01:32:25,302 --> 01:32:27,203
I know exactly what you mean.

1119
01:32:27,405 --> 01:32:29,873
You want to take it all for yourself
and cut me out.

1120
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:34,205
No, I'm on the level with the old man,
like I'd be with you if you weren't here.

1121
01:32:34,277 --> 01:32:37,714
Get off your soapbox. You only sound
foolish out here in this wilderness.

1122
01:32:37,782 --> 01:32:39,409
I know you for what you are.

1123
01:32:39,483 --> 01:32:43,351
For a long time I've had my suspicions
about you and now I know I've been right.

1124
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:46,857
- What suspicions?
- You're not putting anything over on me.

1125
01:32:46,924 --> 01:32:48,414
I see right through you.

1126
01:32:48,492 --> 01:32:51,984
For a long time you've wanted
to bump me off at the first opportunity...

1127
01:32:52,063 --> 01:32:54,191
and bury me out here
in the bush like a dog...

1128
01:32:54,266 --> 01:32:58,133
so you could take not only the old man's
goods but mine in the bargain.

1129
01:32:58,602 --> 01:33:01,469
When you get to Durango safely
you'll have a big laugh...

1130
01:33:01,539 --> 01:33:03,940
thinking how dumb
the old man and I were.

1131
01:33:05,444 --> 01:33:08,709
You make another move towards me
and I'll pull the trigger.

1132
01:33:09,681 --> 01:33:12,241
Now, get your hands up.
Come on, get them up.

1133
01:33:15,954 --> 01:33:17,785
Was I right, or was I?

1134
01:33:18,156 --> 01:33:21,684
You and your Sunday school talk
about protecting people's goods.

1135
01:33:22,028 --> 01:33:25,053
You. Go on, stand up,
and take it like a man.

1136
01:33:25,597 --> 01:33:26,962
Come on, get up.

1137
01:33:30,403 --> 01:33:31,631
Let go of it.

1138
01:33:34,907 --> 01:33:37,306
- The cards are dealt the other way now.
- Yeah.

1139
01:33:37,376 --> 01:33:38,969
Now listen to me...

1140
01:33:39,445 --> 01:33:41,174
Look, you're all wrong.

1141
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,579
Not for a moment did I ever intend
to rob you or do you any harm.

1142
01:33:44,650 --> 01:33:46,140
Just like I said...

1143
01:33:46,219 --> 01:33:49,678
I'd fight for you and yours
like I'd fight for the old man's.

1144
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:52,247
If you really mean that
give me back my gun.

1145
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:01,758
My pal.

1146
01:34:04,003 --> 01:34:08,304
Wouldn't it be better the way things are
to separate tomorrow or even tonight?

1147
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:11,367
- That would suit you fine, wouldn't it?
- Why me more than you?

1148
01:34:11,445 --> 01:34:15,041
So you could fall on me from behind,
sneak up and shoot me in the back.

1149
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:16,582
All right, I'll go first.

1150
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:18,618
And wait for me on the trail
to ambush me?

1151
01:34:18,685 --> 01:34:20,915
Why wouldn't I do it now
if I meant to kill you?

1152
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:23,388
I'll tell you why, because you're yellow.

1153
01:34:23,558 --> 01:34:27,517
You don't have the nerve to pull the
trigger while I'm looking you in the eye.

1154
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:31,690
If you think like that, there's nothing
to do but to tie you up every night.

1155
01:34:36,704 --> 01:34:39,036
I'll tell you what. I'll make you a little bet.

1156
01:34:39,107 --> 01:34:41,838
Three times 35 is 105.

1157
01:34:42,044 --> 01:34:45,274
I'll bet $105,000
you go to sleep before I do.

1158
01:35:25,154 --> 01:35:27,487
Get up there at the head of the train.

1159
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,114
Get up!

1160
01:36:31,089 --> 01:36:34,991
The cards are dealt the other way now,
and for the last time no more shuffling.

1161
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:37,551
- What cards are...
- I'm going to finish this right now.

1162
01:36:37,629 --> 01:36:40,121
I won't take orders from you
like I had to do today.

1163
01:36:40,199 --> 01:36:43,861
- You mean you're going to murder me?
- No, brother, not murder. Your mistake.

1164
01:36:43,936 --> 01:36:47,736
I'm doing it to save my life that you'd take
from me when I wasn't looking at you.

1165
01:36:47,806 --> 01:36:50,435
- The old man'll catch up with you.
- He will, will he?

1166
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:53,377
I got an answer for that one, too.
Know what I'll tell him?

1167
01:36:53,446 --> 01:36:57,405
I'll tell him you tied me to a tree and
made your getaway taking all our goods.

1168
01:36:57,483 --> 01:36:59,451
He'll be looking for you and not me.

1169
01:36:59,519 --> 01:37:03,512
Up. March. Today I had to march
to your music, now you march to mine.

1170
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:05,285
- Where?
- To your funeral.

1171
01:37:06,527 --> 01:37:08,222
Come on, keep going.

1172
01:37:08,996 --> 01:37:11,122
Get up. Sleepy?

1173
01:37:11,931 --> 01:37:14,764
You'll be asleep soon enough.
Sound asleep.

1174
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:55,604
Maybe I didn't kill him.

1175
01:37:56,144 --> 01:37:59,272
Maybe he just staggered and fell down
without being hit.

1176
01:38:35,851 --> 01:38:37,843
You keep it, it's yours anyhow.

1177
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:56,566
No, they won't find him.

1178
01:38:58,175 --> 01:39:01,144
I'll dig a hole for him
first thing in the morning.

1179
01:39:08,152 --> 01:39:09,482
This fire...

1180
01:39:10,287 --> 01:39:11,845
don't give much heat.

1181
01:39:17,595 --> 01:39:18,960
Conscience.

1182
01:39:20,398 --> 01:39:21,661
What a thing.

1183
01:39:23,835 --> 01:39:27,168
If you believe you've got a conscience,
it'll pester you to death.

1184
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:30,071
But if you don't believe you've got one...

1185
01:39:30,241 --> 01:39:32,039
what can it do to you?

1186
01:39:32,778 --> 01:39:36,873
Makes me sick all this talking and fussing
about nonsense.

1187
01:40:53,762 --> 01:40:56,059
Maybe I'd better leave him like he is.

1188
01:40:56,797 --> 01:40:59,322
Ain't very likely anybody will find him.

1189
01:40:59,934 --> 01:41:03,894
In a week, the buzzards and the ants
will have done away with him anyway.

1190
01:41:07,475 --> 01:41:11,673
I don't know what's getting into me.
Was that really a tiger?

1191
01:41:19,989 --> 01:41:20,978
No.

1192
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:26,587
What if his eyes are open, looking at me?

1193
01:41:28,397 --> 01:41:31,457
Best thing to do
is to get to the railroad in a hurry.

1194
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:55,522
Burro.

1195
01:41:57,961 --> 01:42:00,156
It's better not to have buried him.

1196
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:02,332
I did right, yeah.

1197
01:42:04,568 --> 01:42:08,095
What I should have done, maybe,
was bury his clothes...

1198
01:42:08,505 --> 01:42:10,996
and leave him to the ants
and the buzzards.

1199
01:42:11,341 --> 01:42:12,603
Buzzards!

1200
01:42:13,278 --> 01:42:16,678
If somebody saw them circling,
they'd know something was dead.

1201
01:42:17,814 --> 01:42:19,975
Buzzards ain't spotted him yet.

1202
01:42:21,051 --> 01:42:22,485
Lucky for me.

1203
01:42:51,450 --> 01:42:52,610
Curtin!

1204
01:43:02,027 --> 01:43:03,358
Where are you?

1205
01:43:15,374 --> 01:43:18,811
I better get a hold of myself.
I mustn't lose my head.

1206
01:43:20,981 --> 01:43:23,471
There's one thing certain, he ain't here.

1207
01:43:24,683 --> 01:43:26,982
I got it. The tiger.

1208
01:43:28,088 --> 01:43:32,525
Yeah, that's it. The tiger must have
dragged him off to his lair, that's what.

1209
01:43:33,426 --> 01:43:37,453
Yeah, pretty soon, not even the bones
will be left to tell the story.

1210
01:43:43,671 --> 01:43:45,536
Done as if by order.

1211
01:45:26,844 --> 01:45:29,108
I came to in the middle of the night.

1212
01:45:29,947 --> 01:45:32,280
My gun was on the ground beside me.

1213
01:45:33,551 --> 01:45:37,008
He must have left it there
to make it look like suicide.

1214
01:45:38,388 --> 01:45:42,223
I figured he'd come back in the morning
to see if I still had a flicker of life.

1215
01:45:42,293 --> 01:45:44,887
I thought about waiting for him
and letting him have it...

1216
01:45:44,963 --> 01:45:47,864
but there was a good chance
in my condition I might miss...

1217
01:45:47,932 --> 01:45:50,366
so I decided to crawl away
like a poisoned dog.

1218
01:45:50,435 --> 01:45:54,098
- Take it easy, you're talking too much.
- Don't you worry about me.

1219
01:45:54,172 --> 01:45:56,766
I'll pull out of this if only to get that guy.

1220
01:45:56,841 --> 01:46:00,903
It appears our fine Mr. Dobbs has made off
with our goods and is on his way north.

1221
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:04,005
- Yeah.
- I reckon we can't blame him too much.

1222
01:46:04,082 --> 01:46:05,344
What do you mean?

1223
01:46:05,416 --> 01:46:07,851
I mean, he's not a real killer, as killers go.

1224
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,718
I think he's as honest
as the next fella, or almost.

1225
01:46:10,789 --> 01:46:13,883
The mistake was leaving you two
in the depths of the wilderness...

1226
01:46:13,959 --> 01:46:15,926
with more than $100,000 between you.

1227
01:46:15,994 --> 01:46:18,293
That's a big temptation, partner,
believe me.

1228
01:46:18,364 --> 01:46:19,888
He shot me down in cold blood.

1229
01:46:19,965 --> 01:46:23,230
After I was down he shot me
a second time just to make sure.

1230
01:46:23,302 --> 01:46:26,761
If I was young and out there with one
of you, I'd have been tempted, too.

1231
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:29,899
Maybe I wouldn't have fallen,
but I reckon I would've been tempted.

1232
01:46:29,975 --> 01:46:32,671
There now. You're almost as good as new.

1233
01:46:33,746 --> 01:46:36,238
Now, to find that thief
and get our goods back.

1234
01:46:45,959 --> 01:46:49,087
They're not only giving me a horse
but coming to protect me.

1235
01:46:49,162 --> 01:46:50,789
- You ain't going.
- Who says so?

1236
01:46:50,864 --> 01:46:53,060
You wouldn't be up to the hard riding.

1237
01:46:53,134 --> 01:46:55,499
- You aren't leaving me behind.
- Look at you.

1238
01:46:55,569 --> 01:46:59,096
You're weak as a kitten.
Don't worry, I'll look after our interests.

1239
01:46:59,172 --> 01:47:00,332
I'm going.

1240
01:47:00,607 --> 01:47:02,974
Well, I reckon you're going.

1241
01:47:34,443 --> 01:47:35,670
Burro!

1242
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:18,648
Made it.

1243
01:49:22,854 --> 01:49:24,685
Have you got any cigarettes?

1244
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:30,961
No, I haven't. I've got a little tobacco...

1245
01:49:32,231 --> 01:49:33,721
if that'll do.

1246
01:49:34,433 --> 01:49:37,231
No paper to roll it in?

1247
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:39,164
Papers?

1248
01:49:42,141 --> 01:49:43,608
Here you are.

1249
01:49:45,946 --> 01:49:48,470
- Going to Durango?
- Yeah.

1250
01:49:49,648 --> 01:49:51,343
That's where I'm headed.

1251
01:49:51,751 --> 01:49:53,777
I've got to sell my burros.

1252
01:49:54,554 --> 01:49:57,216
I got to get some money.
I haven't got a red cent.

1253
01:49:57,290 --> 01:49:58,518
Matches?

1254
01:50:02,896 --> 01:50:05,558
Money? We need money, too.

1255
01:50:06,566 --> 01:50:09,262
Yeah? I could use a good mule driver...

1256
01:50:10,203 --> 01:50:11,831
maybe two or three.

1257
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:21,614
How much is the pay?

1258
01:50:22,683 --> 01:50:23,980
Two pesos.

1259
01:50:24,485 --> 01:50:26,885
Of course, I can't pay you in advance...

1260
01:50:26,954 --> 01:50:30,117
I got to wait till I get to town
so I can get the money.

1261
01:50:31,959 --> 01:50:33,984
Do I know you from someplace?

1262
01:50:34,862 --> 01:50:36,454
Maybe I know you.

1263
01:50:37,432 --> 01:50:39,628
No, I don't think so.

1264
01:50:42,136 --> 01:50:44,297
- Are you alone?
- No.

1265
01:50:45,807 --> 01:50:47,275
I'm not alone.

1266
01:50:48,677 --> 01:50:51,578
I got a couple of friends
coming along on horseback.

1267
01:50:52,381 --> 01:50:54,905
Yeah, they ought to be here any minute.

1268
01:51:06,429 --> 01:51:07,896
That's funny.

1269
01:51:08,164 --> 01:51:11,826
A man all by himself in bandit country
with a string of burros...

1270
01:51:12,067 --> 01:51:14,832
and his friends behind him on horseback.

1271
01:51:22,377 --> 01:51:24,505
Your friends must be very far behind you.

1272
01:51:24,581 --> 01:51:27,379
Pablo cannot see any dust
even from their horses.

1273
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:29,342
They'll be along any minute, I tell you.

1274
01:51:34,158 --> 01:51:37,354
I know who you are.
You're the guy in the hole.

1275
01:51:37,694 --> 01:51:39,855
The one who wouldn't give us the rifle.

1276
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:42,692
I never laid eyes on you until now.

1277
01:51:43,734 --> 01:51:45,725
What you got in the bags?

1278
01:51:51,876 --> 01:51:54,936
- Seems to me like hides.
- Yeah.

1279
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:58,511
That's what they are, hides.

1280
01:51:58,849 --> 01:52:01,148
Ought to bring in quite a lot of money.

1281
01:52:02,453 --> 01:52:03,545
Yeah.

1282
01:52:05,656 --> 01:52:09,457
Sure you don't want to come along
with me and help me with the burros?

1283
01:52:15,633 --> 01:52:16,895
Burro.

1284
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:29,406
Get away from my burro.

1285
01:52:29,848 --> 01:52:34,251
We can sell those burros
for just as good a price as you'd get.

1286
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:35,912
Get away from my burro.

1287
01:52:35,988 --> 01:52:40,721
You can't frighten even a sick louse
with that. You can only shoot one of us...

1288
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:45,196
and he wouldn't mind too much.
The federales are after him anyway.

1289
01:52:45,264 --> 01:52:47,129
So what with your gun?

1290
01:52:47,667 --> 01:52:50,067
- We'll take that chance.
- Get back there.

1291
01:58:11,636 --> 01:58:15,036
- Shooting.
- Volley. Execution probably.

1292
01:58:37,029 --> 01:58:39,361
- Dobbs is dead.
- What?

1293
01:58:39,965 --> 01:58:43,229
- Bandits got him.
- Our goods. What about our goods?

1294
01:58:51,209 --> 01:58:54,234
- What?
- He says our goods are safe in his office.

1295
01:58:56,381 --> 01:58:59,646
- It's not here, Howard.
- Keep your shirt on.

1296
01:59:25,979 --> 01:59:27,105
What?

1297
01:59:41,562 --> 01:59:44,656
He heard the bandits talking
while they were waiting to be shot.

1298
01:59:44,732 --> 01:59:47,359
They thought it was bags of sand
hidden among the hide...

1299
01:59:47,433 --> 01:59:49,732
to make it weigh more
when Dobbs went to sell them.

1300
01:59:49,803 --> 01:59:51,134
Where are they?

1301
01:59:59,347 --> 02:00:01,837
They're in the ruins outside town.
Come on!

1302
02:02:23,897 --> 02:02:27,229
Laugh, Curtin, old boy,
it's a great joke played on us...

1303
02:02:27,299 --> 02:02:29,927
by the lord of fate or nature,
whatever you prefer...

1304
02:02:30,002 --> 02:02:33,598
but whoever or whatever played it
certainly had a sense of humor!

1305
02:02:33,673 --> 02:02:36,233
The gold has gone back
to where we found it!

1306
02:02:55,762 --> 02:02:59,221
This is worth ten months
of suffering and labor, this joke is!

1307
02:03:26,361 --> 02:03:28,795
Well, Howard, what next I wonder?

1308
02:03:29,297 --> 02:03:32,289
I'm all fixed as far as I'm concerned
as a medicine man.

1309
02:03:32,367 --> 02:03:34,460
I'll have three meals a day, five if I want...

1310
02:03:34,536 --> 02:03:37,334
roof over my head,
and a drink now and then to warm me up.

1311
02:03:37,405 --> 02:03:40,169
I will be worshipped, fed,
and treated like a high priest...

1312
02:03:40,242 --> 02:03:44,145
for telling people what they want to hear.
Good medicine men are born not made.

1313
02:03:44,213 --> 02:03:45,908
Come and see me sometime, my boy.

1314
02:03:45,982 --> 02:03:48,916
Even you'll take off your hat
when you see how respected I am.

1315
02:03:48,984 --> 02:03:51,953
The day before yesterday,
they wanted to make me their legislature.

1316
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:53,318
Their whole legislature!

1317
02:03:53,389 --> 02:03:57,155
I don't know what that means. I think
it's the highest honor they can bestow.

1318
02:03:57,226 --> 02:04:00,024
Yeah, I'm all fixed
for the rest of my natural life.

1319
02:04:00,096 --> 02:04:02,257
How about yourself?
What do you aim to do?

1320
02:04:02,331 --> 02:04:03,923
I haven't got any idea.

1321
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,766
You're young. You've got plenty of time
to make three or four fortunes.

1322
02:04:08,204 --> 02:04:11,140
You know, the worst ain't so bad
when it finally happens.

1323
02:04:11,208 --> 02:04:14,142
Not half as bad as you figure it'll be
before it happens.

1324
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:16,576
I'm no worse off than I was in Tampico.

1325
02:04:16,779 --> 02:04:19,681
I'm out a couple of hundred dollars
when you come down to it.

1326
02:04:19,750 --> 02:04:22,184
Not very much compared
to what Dobbsie lost.

1327
02:04:22,252 --> 02:04:24,345
Any special place you're bent on going?

1328
02:04:24,421 --> 02:04:26,787
No, all places are the same to me.

1329
02:04:27,323 --> 02:04:30,418
You can keep my share of what the burros
and the hides'll bring...

1330
02:04:30,494 --> 02:04:34,521
if you use it to buy a ticket to Dallas.
See Cody's widow. Better than writing.

1331
02:04:34,598 --> 02:04:38,501
And besides, it's July and the fruit harvest.

1332
02:04:42,839 --> 02:04:44,101
How about it?

1333
02:04:46,310 --> 02:04:47,573
It's a deal.

1334
02:04:50,515 --> 02:04:52,107
Well, let's get going.

1335
02:05:06,764 --> 02:05:08,925
- Goodbye, Curtin.
- Goodbye, Howard.

1336
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,968
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
